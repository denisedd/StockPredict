Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, said: A poll from ABC that gave Trump a slender lead over Clinton has been the catalyst for some fairly significant risk-off moves...Given how far ahead in the polls Clinton was very recently, the fact that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about a close race again is clearly rattling investors. Suffice to say we can expect more volatility in the coming week. Against the euro the pound is not faring so well, down 0,77% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1064. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some gloom from pro-Brexit fund manager Crispin Odey, who has told investors the UK could face recession and the stock market could slump by 80%. Bloomberg reported: Crispin Odey, whose main hedge fund has lost about 43 percent this year, says U.K. stocks could slump 80 percent as the economy is roiled by a recession and higher inflation following the vote to leave the European Union. Shares will come under pressure after the FTSE 100 share index climbed 30 percent over five years even as earnings fell by 80 percent, the money manager said in a letter to investors last week seen by Bloomberg News... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are now destined to have a recession in the U.K. as well as inflation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Odey wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be difficult for the stock market to remain above all of this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A host of badly received results - from Standard Chartered to BP to Shire and Pfizer - has helped push markets lower, not to mention renewed uncertainty over the US election. A poll showing Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s votes has unnerved investors while mixed US figures - good manufacturing, poor construction - just added to the downbeat mood. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Despite two attempts at a rally today, the FTSE 100 remains in the red... European markets have had it far worse, with the Dax losing over 1% today, with euro strength helping to take the shine off markets on the continent that have enjoyed a recent spate of outperformance compared to London... With US markets taking a hit this afternoon as well it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take Sherlock Holmes to work out that the new polls giving Donald Trump an edge in the election are spooking investors. The parallels with Brexit are there for everyone to see, but the key battleground states are still leaning towards the Democrats. In all probability, the election will still turn out as expected, but the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nagging doubts are clearly getting the better of it this afternoon. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 37.08 points or 0.53% at 6917.14 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.3% to 10,526.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.86% lower at 4470.28 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.32% to 16,898.28 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.12% down at 9040.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.47% to 582.45 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 103 points or 0.59%. Meanwhile HSBC analysts say buy gold whoever wins the US election. Bloomberg reports: Although they deem a Donald Trump victory more supportive for the price of the metal than a win by Hillary Clinton, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Precious Metals Analyst James Steel says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enjoy at least a 8 percent jump whoever wins the race. Both candidates have espoused trade policies that could stimulate demand, with gold offering a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection against protectionism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Even the relatively more internationalist Democratic candidate has argued for the renegotiation of longstanding free-trade agreements. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive for gold \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not on the scale of Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If the real-estate magnate triumphs, gold could rise to $1,500 an ounce, according to HSBC, up from around $1,289 at 10:55 a.m. in New York. If Clinton wins, the price of the metal could improve to $1,400 an ounce by year end, Steel writes, adding that a Democratic sweep of Congress would further stoke demand for the metal owing to a possible boost in fiscal spending. On gold, Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Weakness in the US dollar and rising uncertainty from Presidential nominee Donald Trump rising in the polls saw gold breakout to a three-week high. The gold price has continued to climb after CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] data showed the first rise in net long positions in four weeks. Gold appears to be being accumulated as a hedge against equity market declines before the US election. In times of uncertainty, gold and silver are seen as havens for investors and so it is proving at the moment, ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate decision and, crucially, the US presidential election. Gold has climbed from $1276 an ounce to $1288, while silver is up from $17.87 to $18.37. The ISM said the October PMI indicated growth for the 89th consecutive month in the overall US economy, and indicated growth in the manufacturing sector for the second consecutive month. The ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Holcomb said: The past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI for January through October (51 percent) corresponds to a 2.5 percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualised basis. In addition, if the PMI for October (51.9 percent) is annualised, it corresponds to a 2.8 percent increase in real GDP annually. Back with the ISM manufacturing report, and here are some of the comments from the respondents to the survey: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Domestic business steady. Export business trending higher.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Chemical Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very favorable outlook in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Computer &amp; Electronic Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are looking at a considerable slowdown for October and November. Production is down 20 percent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Primary Metals) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is much better.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Fabricated Metal Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong economy driving steady sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to the hurricane and other storms, our business is up significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Machinery) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ongoing strength seen in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Miscellaneous Manufacturing) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Customers continue to press price reductions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Transportation Equipment) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business remains strong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hard to predict oil price dynamics, but there seems to be a consensus that the market is stabilizing, at least above USD 50 bbl this month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Petroleum &amp; Coal Products) Bradley J. Holcomb, chair of the Institute for Supply Management, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comments from the panel are largely positive citing a favorable economy and steady sales, with some exceptions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But there are some poor US construction figures. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.4% in September, compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise. The figure for August was revised slightly higher, from a 0.7% drop to a 0.5% fall. And the other manufacturing survey does indeed also show signs of improvement. The ISM manufacturing activity index climbed from 51.5 in September to 51.9 last month, better than the 51.7 expected. And on jobs, the picture is more optimistic. The manufacturing employment index jumped from 49.7 in September to 52.9, well ahead of the forecast level of 50. This is the highest level since June 2015. The two manufacturing surveys strike a positive note as the US Federal Reserve begins its latest two day meeting. However it appears unlikely the Fed will announce an interest rate rise tomorrow, just ahead of the election, even if a December hike could well be on the cards. Despite the good US manufacturing performance, firms are reluctant to take on staff, says IHS Markit, partly due to caution ahead of the election. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said: October saw manufacturing enjoy its best performance for a year. Factories benefitted from rising domestic and export sales, driving output higher to mark an encouragingly strong start to the fourth quarter. The survey also picked up signs of manufacturers and their customers rebuilding their inventories, often filling warehouses in anticipation of stronger demand in coming months. However, a widespread reticence to take on extra staff highlights lingering caution with respect to investing in capacity, at least until after the presidential election. Hiring is also being subdued partly by worries about escalating costs, with the October survey recording the largely monthly rise in factory prices for five years. While output growth is accelerating, so too are inflationary pressures, which will further fuel speculation that the Fed will hike interest rates again in December. And here is the first manufacturing survey, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly positive. The final IHS Markit manufacturing PMI figure for October has come in at 53.4, marginally higher than the initial estimate of 53.2 and up on September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final reading of 51.5. This is the highest level since October 2015. In short order, we get the ISM manufacturing reading, which is also expected to show an improvement. Ahead of two US manufacturing surveys due shortly, the US market is slightly ahead at the open, but with continuing nervousness about the forthcoming election - with one new poll showing Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton - investors remain cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 12 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.2% higher. As a reminder, all three indices recorded their worst monthly performances since January in October. Alert! Bank of America Merrill Lynch has predicted that the pound could plunge to just $1.15 by the first quarter of 2017. In a new research note, analysts at the bank warn that sterling hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully adjusted to the reality of Brexit, and have slashed their forecasts for the pound. They also predict the pound will weaken to just 94p against the euro, closer to parity. BAML believe some investors are hoping that court cases brought by Remain campaigners will stop Theresa May triggering article 50 without a parliamentary vote. BAML say: Whilst the outcome is still unknown, client feedback suggests to us there is hope that the verdict may derail the governments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intentions. The decision on the review is pending and is expected soon, but this will not be the end of the matter. In our view, an appeal to the Supreme Court is a possibility by whoever loses the hearing and if the verdict is appealed, this could be held before the end of the year. A defining feature of our conversations with clients since the Referendum is the belief that Brexit may never happen. For this reason, we think some investors retain the hope that somehow the courts will able to prevent the triggering of A50. But.... BAML believe that article 50 WILL be triggered, with or without MPs voting. The result of the Referendum has been accepted by most politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and with seven out of ten Labour constituencies having voted to leave the EU we find it hard to imagine that Labour MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would go against that mandate. And that would send the pound down to new 31-year lows early next year, before recovering through the year. We think Q1 could mark the low in the pound. A combination of US dollar weakness, Brexit fatigue and data stabilisation should see pound recover into end-2017. This graph shows how the pound has fallen faster than in many previous sterling crises (and boy, have there been a few over the years), but not as sharply or as far as after Black Wednesday in 1992 (yet anyway) BAML also dub sterling the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBritish peso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saying it has been trading like an emerging market currency such as the South African rand (ZAR) or the Turkish lira (TRY) Back in the markets, two pharmaceuticals firms have both disappointed investors with their latest financial results. Shares in Pfizer, the viagra-maker, have slipped by 2.2% in pre-market trading after it missed its profit and sales targets in the last quarter. Reuters explains: Pfizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, generated sales of $550 million, missing the consensus forecast of $576 million compiled by Evercore ISI. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lyrica pain drug brought in sales of $1.05 billion, missing expectation of $1.28 billion, but its Prevnar vaccine generated $1.54 billion, above the forecast of $1.48 billion. Separately, Shire, the London-listed drugs group, has plunged by 5.5% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after posting smaller revenues than the City expected. The company insists, though, that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly confident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth prospects. The new dry eye disease drug, called Xiidra, has made a very strong start, it adds. Wall Street bank JP Morgan has got Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. Analysts Malcolm Barr and Allan Monks argue there are five \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclines of defence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 against the argument that the Carney, and the rest of the monetary policy committee, violated the Banks independence by being so gloomy about Brexit. The judgements were limited to short run impacts, not the long run. They were shared by the whole of the MPC. They related directly to areas where the BoE had to make policy decisions. Supporting analysis for the views expressed was provided. And those views were in line with the consensus among most private and international institutions. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get away from the fact that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by a solid 0.5% in the three months after the refererendum. But still.... In our view, the fact that the economy has held up better than expected thus far reflects a forecasting error that many have made, rather than being clear evidence of any abuse of office. The opposition Labour party have tweeted their support for Mark Carney today: Last night Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, criticised the attacks on the BoE governor from some conservative MPs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That a committed public servant like Mr Carney has been the subject of briefings, on and off the record, questioning his fitness for the role - when he himself has no opportunity to respond - is an indictment of the toxic atmosphere now brewing inside the Conservative Party.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group is also concerned that UK manufacturers are suffering such a sharp spike in import costs: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ego to expand too quickly, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rather critical assessment of the governor, from Ben Habib, CEO of First Property Group, a fund manager. The pressure on Mr. Carney to go was portrayed as coming from Tory Brexiters and his decision to stay another year has been described as providing stability during the Brexit process. Both assertions are wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr. Carney should have resigned early because he is simply not competent. Perhaps the best of example of this was his assessment of the UK economy in August when he launched another wave of pernicious QE. He justified this decision in significant part because of his prediction that the economy would grow by only 0.1% in the third quarter. In fact it grew at five times this rate. His remaining as Governor of the BoE during the Brexit process is going to materially add to the challenges faced by Mrs. May.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carlo Alberto de Casa, chief analyst at spread-betting firm ActivTrades, also sees Carneys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision as positive: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe City has welcomed news that Mark Carney will stay one more year at the helm of the Bank of England. When he eventually leaves the post in summer 2019, the Brexit process should largely be over. Significantly, we have seen the FTSE 100 go up, whilst the pound is also performing well. This appears to reflect a certain amount of relief and reassurance in the City that Carney will be at the controls for a while longer.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, has told us that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pleased Mark Carney chose to stay at the Bank of England until June 2019. Gadhia says Carney showed leadership immediately after the EU referendum, and was right to express his view on Brexit. Thank goodness for that would be my comment. When I think back to 24 June when an awful lot of people wondered who was leading the country I was pretty relieved when Mark Carney stepped up and was sensible. We need stability going forward. How difficult to have a job where we are all able to comment [on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance]. When you take on a big role like that you have to be a public figure and expect to have public comment. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t criticise people for making the comments they have made. I do think now he is here we should let him get on with his job. Hopefully that will add to the stability of the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (via my colleague Sean Farrell) Capital Economics have taken one look at Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey, and produced this excellent chart showing how UK inflation is heading a lot higher.... Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s October manufacturing PMI should deter the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee from cutting interest rates again, at its meeting on Thursday. As well as showing that companies are faring quite well, the data also shows how the slump in sterling has painful effects as well as benefits. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weaker pound is supporting improving demand from export customers, but price rises from higher import costs are becoming more significant and will be felt in consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets sooner rather than later. If any MPC members were on the fence about interest rate moves this month, this latest survey would argue against any further cuts right now. Dave Atkinson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, is encouraged by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing activity remains at its highest level since January, and the fact that firms have maintained a positive outlook amid an uncertain landscape and a devalued pound is something to be applauded. Markit also produced this chart, showing just how sharply import costs have jumped since the Brexit vote: That is likely to feed through to prices in the shops. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance against the euro and dollar was particularly felt on imports as manufacturers experienced one of the fastest rises in average costs for raw materials in the 25-year survey history. Especially highlighted were costs for flour, dairy products, steel and zinc. These price hikes resulted in manufacturers passing on higher prices to their customers as charges rose for the sixth consecutive month and to the steepest degree since June 2011. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is probably returning to growth this quarter, as the weak pound helps factories to win export orders -- but also makes raw materials pricier. The monthly healthcheck from data firm Markit shows that UK factories grew their output last month, with new orders rising and staffing levels picking up too. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI to 54.3, down slightly from 55.5 in September, but well above the long-run average of 51.5 (anything over 50 = growth). The survey shows that the slump in the pound since June is helping the manufacturing sector. Bosses reported a rise in new exports, and new orders from the USA, the EU and China. But the weaker currency is also driving up the cost of imports, like oil, energy, metals and pork products. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK manufacturing sector remained on a firm footing in October and should return to growth in the fourth quarter. Despite slowing from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs, growth of output and new orders continued to defy expectations, rising at marked rates and supporting the fastest job creation in a year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main topic of the latest PMI survey was, however, the impact of the sterling depreciation on manufacturers. On the positive side, the boost to competitiveness drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output volumes. The down-side of the weaker currency is becoming increasingly evident, however, with increased import prices leading to one of the steepest rises in purchasing costs in the near 25-year survey history. Around 90% of companies offering a reason for increased costs made some reference to the sterling exchange rate. Eek. Shares in Standard Chartered have just slumped by 5%, after it posting its latest financial results. The Asia-focused bank posted a pre-tax profit of $458m up from a $139m loss a year earlier, but shy of forecasts of $500m profits. Income dipped to $3.47bn, from $3.68bn. CEO Bill Winters doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound best pleased, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We now have a stronger balance sheet...but income and profit levels are not yet acceptable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Standard Chartered also revealed that it is being investigated by Hong Kong regulators, over an IPO (stock market flotation) it handled in 2009. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Janan Ganesh has handed out a pasting to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics in Westminster this morning: The pound is living up to its reputation for volatility, and dropping back from earlier highs. Not every investor is toasting Mark Carney this morning, though. Savvas Savouri, chief economist of asset manager Toscafund, has been criticising the governor on Radio 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wake Up To Money this morning, and on Sky News last night. City veteran David Buik is also relieved that Mark Carney has decided not to leave in 2018: Most observers will be delighted that he did not wait until after the Inflation Report and MPC meeting this coming Thursday, to announce his decision. Many hoped he would stay the full trip until 2021. And in his classic colourful prose, Buik argues that Carney was rather too gloomy about the consequences of EU exit. The reassurance he needed consisted, I think, of some TLC and an official ringing endorsement from Chancellor Philip Hammond to follow up positive comments made by senior government ministers. In terms of Mr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duty of care post the Referendum, he was right to point out that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy might not be as robust immediately prior to the BREXIT and post its withdrawal. However I think he ladled on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSodom &amp; Gomorrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 syndrome far too thickly, which gave the impression that he was massively pro-REMAIN and possibly an acolyte of George Osborne, who, after all appointed him. The pound hit its highest level since 20 October this morning, nudging $1.228. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up a cent this week, but still sharply lower than a month ago - when traders started worrying about a hard Brexit. Shares are rising in London this morning, in another sign that Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12-month extension has reassured the markets. The FTSE 100 has gained 31 points, or 0.44%, to 6985 points. Royal Dutch Shell is leading the way, up 3.7%, after posting an 8% jump in quarterly profits this morning. Mining firms are also gaining ground, after overnight data showed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories growing faster than expected. That should bolster demand for iron ore, coal, copper and nickel. The pound continues to climb, and is now trading at $1.227 - up almost one cent this week. Labour MP John Mann argues that Theresa May, and chancellor Philip Hammond, have botched the whole issue of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure at the BoE. Writing for Politics Home, Mann says the pair have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dragged kicking and screaming by the markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to extend the contract of a governor who deserved more respect for his actions after the Brexit vote. Mann says: The day after the referendum saw the Prime Minister resign after previously promising he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and the Chancellor disappear as the Treasury went silent at a time when the markets went into a panic. Into this breach stepped Mark Carney, speaking publicly from the Bank of England, who calmly stated the steps the bank had already taken to reassure the market and would be taking to ensure that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic system remained functional. It should never have to come to the point where his re-appointment became a such a test of strength for the Prime Minister and Chancellor. Mann also hits out at former Conservative ministers William Hague and Michael Gove for attacking Carney. During 2016 the Bank of England will have to have found two new deputy Governors to replace Andrew Bailey who was appointed to run the FCA by George Osborne, and Dr Minouche Shafik who is leaving her role as head of markets and banking. Their calls for a new Governor to be appointed at a time when the Government is about to start its negotiations with the EU was staggeringly short sighted and suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the challenges facing the British economy. Investors are relieved that Mark Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quit the UK in 2018, as had initially been his plan. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, says yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to serve an extra year is is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a welcome sign of stability in exceptionally uncertain times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She writes: The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that Carney has extended his term, after all, if he extended it once, could he do so again? The pound has enjoyed a major turnaround, and is the best performing currency in the G10 at the start of this week. It is higher by a decent 0.5% against both the USD and the euro, and has also done well against the yen However, the City would be even happier if the governor had agreed to stay until 2012. An extra year is good, however the uncertainty caused by Brexit makes it very difficult to anticipate the health of the UK economy in three years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. Thus, even after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, Carney may still leave the Bank of England at a delicate time for the UK economy, as the government tries to navigate a smooth exit from the EU. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 departure makes the front page of several newspapers today. The Telegraph point out that the governor has decided to quit shortly after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU has been concluded, following a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deterioration of relations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Downing Street in recent weeks. The Times also point out that recent criticism from Conservative politicians may have encouraged Carney not to serve three extra years. They write: Mark Carney surprised the government last night by turning down the chance to stay in his post until 2021 after receiving lukewarm backing from Downing Street. The governor of the Bank of England said that he would leave in June 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the earliest opportunity to depart after Brexit. The Financial Times points out that the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family will return to Canada in the summer of 2018, as originally planned. These personal circumstances (Carney is blessed with four daughters) are the reason he originally only signed up for five years. Carney also graces the front page of the Guardian: The pound got an immediate lift last night when the Bank of England announced that governor Carney would serve an extra year. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still trading around $1.224 this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy today, when data firm Markit publishes its latest Purchasing Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Index (PMI) covering the manufacturing sector, at 9.30am GMT. Economists are expecting to see that factory output grew at a steady rate in October, with the PMI (which measures activity) dipping to around 55.0 from 55.4 in September. This is the first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic data for the fourth quarter of 2016, so it will be scrutinised closely for signs that the Brexit vote is causing a slowdown. RBC Capital Markets say: UK PMIs enjoyed something of a rollercoaster ride in the three months after the Brexit referendum before returning to close to their long-run average at the end of Q3. For today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing print, we look for a slight weakening to 55.0 from 55.4, though that is coming off the highest reading for the manufacturing reading since June 2014. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the Bank of England, after Mark Carney decided to serve one extra year as governor, until 2019. Our financial editor Nils Pratley says the Canadian central banker got one over the prime minister. He writes: You want me to stay for an extra three years? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do one more and then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m off. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the Bank of England in 2019 looks to be a straightforward snub to Theresa May. Earlier on Monday, the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman described the governor as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the best person for the job, which is the sort of thing you say if you think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do the full eight-year term. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing six. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one more year than was signalled back at his appointment, but it is not the full deal. Those angry Tory Brexiters who have been making mischief at Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense for the past month will count this result as a victory for them. And on the corporate front, oil giants BP and Shell are both reporting results this morning, along with Virgin Money, MoneySupermarket.com, and Standard Chartered bank. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer are reporting later too.",

The statement comments that \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while adding the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the line that it wants to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.</p> <p>Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement.

Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower.</p> <p>But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks.</p> <p>The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 are down 2-3%. </p> <p>There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56.</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0f8ee4b029b92ca44c77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:12:51.686Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar continues to weaken against the pound.</p> <p>Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high.</p> <p>The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1078.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0bc3e4b07ceadb3a1abb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:52:41.324Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with oil:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Back to Algiers<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brent?src=hash\">#Brent</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTI?src=hash\">#WTI</a> crude <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oil?src=hash\">#oil</a> have now lost all gains made after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a> agreed output limits with other producers Sept 28<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OOTT?src=hash\">#OOTT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xb3NZzdBKN\">pic.twitter.com/xb3NZzdBKN</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Johnson (@chris1reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">November 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a09fae4b07ceadb3a1aae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:48:40.140Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries.</strong></p> <p>The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014.

This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.</p> <p>Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.</p> <p>However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the Fed later on today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5819fcc5e4b029b92ca44c01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T14:48:42.158Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/793825218724782080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">$50 fading fast.

                "bodyText":"But it is not a given that the Fed will hike in December, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: There is little in the statement to suggest that a December hike is definitely going to happen (markets currently pricing in a 67% chance of a move). The statement comments that \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while adding the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the line that it wants to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting. Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution. The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement. The US dollar index has lost 0.3% to 97.38. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Although there was no rate change today, it looks increasingly likely there will be one in December. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: With just days to go before election fever sweeps America, Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Interest Rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming ever more likely that Yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the American economy is gradually picking up steam. She made clear in September that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish. The Fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term. In September it said: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. This now reads: Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Fed said in its statement: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. This time there were only two Fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three, Esther George and Loretta Mester. Eric Rosengren, who voted for a rise last time, has now sided with the majority. BREAKING NEWS To no one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great surprise, the Federal Reserve has opted to leave US interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election. It said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking. The US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour. While most commentators expect there to be no change - not this close to the presidential election - the prospect of a rate rise in December is thought to be reasonably likely, given the recent reassuring US economic data. There is likely to be a focus - as usual - on the exact wording of the Fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the September comments. At that meeting seven of the Fed members voted for no change, with three, Esther George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren, backing an increase. Any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in December. Investors have been unnerved by suggestions that Donald Trump is gaining ground in the US presidential race, with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over Hillary Clinton. Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower. But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks. The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 are down 2-3%. There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar continues to weaken against the pound. Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high. The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1078. Back with oil: Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries. The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014. Markit said the surveys hinted at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 a welcome resurgence of life in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories at the start of the fourth quarter. Inflationary pressures also picked up to the highest for nearly three years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said the data were roughly consistent with global manufacturing output rising at a reasonable 4% annual pace. With investors spooked by the prospect of Donald Trump possibly winning the US election, not to mention the plunge in oil prices following the jump in US crude stocks, markets remain under pressure. The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 1.2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 1.1%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has not been so badly hit and is currently 0.2% lower. That could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing Trump in the lead. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%. Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed. But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said: The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar. However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the Fed later on today. Oil prices are under pressure again after a much bigger than expected rise in US crude stocks. Last week, crude stocks rose 14.42m barrels to 482.58m compared to expectations of an increase of just 1m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. This is the highest weekly build on record. Last week there was a 0.55m fall in oil stocks. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.21m barrels, higher than the 1.9m drop expected. A rise in stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday had already signalled a jump in the EIA figures was possible: With the build in stocks signalling oversupply and falling demand, Brent crude is on the slide, down 2.89% to $46.75 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3.2% to $45.15. Time for a quick recap. World markets are falling back today, as investors get a bad case of pre-US election jitters. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit its lowest level since the end of September, while the pound has popped over $1.23 for the first time in three weeks. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has warned that the UK will be downgraded if it loses \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 access to the EU single market after Brexit. The credit rating agency says growth will suffer if British firms lose their current access: One scenario that Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considers to be realistic is a series of accords offering access to the EU market for goods and more constrained access for services, in particular financial services. However, such an outcome is far from certain. Alastair Darling, the former UK chancellor, says there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcurgent need\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Britain and the EU to hold grown-up talks about the situation. But UK drinkers may find themselves struggling to find a pint of foreign beer in their local Wetherspoons. Chairman Tim Martin says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take steps if Brussels keeps \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbullying\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the UK. A UK court will rule tomorrow on whether Theresa May trigger article 50 and begin the Brexit process without MPs voting on the issue. Set your alarm for 10am GMT! Nervous investors have just pushed the gold price up to a new one-month high,at $1,300.91 per ounce. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating is vulnerable hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improved the mood in the City. The FTSE 100 is still hovering at a one-month low, down 32 points at 6884. The other European markets are also in the red, down around 0.8%, leaving the Stoxx 600 index at its lowest since July. And shares are also dropping on Wall Street at the start of trading: Investors are still worrying about that opinion poll, putting Donald Trump narrowly ahead of Hillary Clinton. So the dollar remains under pressure , keeping the pound up over the $1.23 mark for the first time in two weeks. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown currency service, says: The dollar is broadly lower ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve interest rate decision, with US election anxieties returning to the fore after Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead over Trump in the polls has evaporated following the new FBI probe into her personal email use. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are suddenly considering that Trump has a real chance of victory, following the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new probe into Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails. Global stock markets are lower this morning, as US election fears dominate, despite a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of top tier data to contend with. The sudden change in fortunes set in train on Friday has seen investors run for cover amid a realisation that Trump might actually win. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report from the US campaign trail. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit warning, plus some other developments: A new survey of US employment has come in weaker than expected. The monthly ADP survey shows that US companies created 147,000 new jobs in October, shy of the 165,000 which economists expected. The construction sector saw a sharp drop in employment, down 15,000. This may suggest that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll - the main measure of US employment -- will be weak..... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen signs today that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market may be slowing. First, Nationwide reported that prices stalled last month - ending a 15 month run of rising prices. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, says the market seems \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly subdued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Second.. data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest survey of the building sector painted a mixed picture. The construction PMI (which tracks activity) rose to 52.6 from 52.3, which shows business activity increases at fastest pace since March. But...new order growth slowed, and business confidence dipped sharply to its second-lowest level since May 2013. Markit says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the EU referendum. A number of survey respondents cited the impact of Brexit uncertainty on investor sentiment, alongside reduced confidence towards the general economic outlook. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Enda Kenny, has warned that negotiations between EU states over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could turn vicious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking at a Brexit conference in Dublin, Kenny said he and Theresa May are both committed to avoiding a new border being built between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Kenny said: Neither I, nor the prime minister, desire to limit the freedom of people on both sides of the Irish sea to trade, live, work and travel freely across these islands. And he also hinted at the tensions already developing between London and the rest of the EU: If you go to Downing Street, if you drop in there it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine, but sometimes when friends call they can overstay their welcome. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Heads-up: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal correspondent says the high court will rule tomorrow morning whether article 50 can be triggered without a parliamentary vote: Kerching! The pound just hit $1.23 for the first time in two weeks. Sterling has now gained one and a half-cents since Monday morning, partly due to relief that Mark Carney will stay as Bank of England governor until June 2019. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is mainly due to fears over the US election (as covered earlier), which have sent the dollar down against the yen, the euro and the Swiss franc as well. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new report on the consequences of the EU referendum is only available to its customers, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a summary here: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: UK sovereign rating would be downgraded if the UK was unable to conclude an agreement with the EU that protected core elements of its access to the Single Market The rating agency also has bad news for Remain supporters who are hoping that Brexit might not happen: In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, there is little likelihood that the UK will not exit the EU. The prospect of Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ditching European drinks brands in a Brexit protest has caused quite a stir. Historian Greg Jenner was reminded of the great Gin Craze that gripped Britain three hundred years ago, when the UK tried to restrict imports of French brandy in favour of British gin. It backfired, though, once Britons developed quite a thirst for it. Journalist Rupert Myers suggests such a move might backfire on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpoon: Juho Romakkaniemi, head of cabinet to EC vice-president Jyrki Katainen, has criticised the idea. Some people have even suggested that it sounds like a skit from The Pub Landlord, Al Murray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satirical character. And it soon might be.... Alastair Darling, the former chancellor of the exchequer, says Theresa May urgently needs to give clarity about the sort of Brexit deal she wants. Speaking a moment ago, Lord Darling says the prime minister needs to spell out her plans, so a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grown-up conversation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can take place with Brussels. That would help Britain to fulfil June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum while limiting the long-term economic damage of Brexit, he argues. Darling told Bloomberg TV that: The referendum decision is the biggest single challenge facing the UK arguably since the end of the Second World War. Darling points out that Nissan, the Japanese car maker, has received assurances from May which gave it the confidence to build two new models at its Sunderland plant. That could indicate that May wants Britain to remain part of the single market, and the customs union, Darling adds - but is that just for the auto sector? What about the banks, who rely on passporting to offer services across the EU? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to salvage as much as we can so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt trade and damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term growth prospects. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pertinent point, given Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning earlier today. Darling argues that the government cannot \u00e2\u20ac\u0153segregate out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the UK economy, dealing with some concerns immediately (eg Nissan) and leaving other sectors in the dark for a couple of years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one things all businesses don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like is uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Darling, who was Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister during the 2008 crisis, says that both sides have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recognise the new reality, and get on with it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The boss of pub chain JD Wetherspoon has weighed in on Brexit this morning, threatening to ditch European drinks brands unless EU leaders stop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bullying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain. Tim Martin is not happy that European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker, French President Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel have all said Britain should pay a high price for leaving the EU. He told the Guardian this morning that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared to throw out foreign drinks brands, and replace them with British alternatives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Wetherspoon or British buyers are in a weak position because we can switch from Swedish cider to British cider. So the people put in a weak position are the sellers and I think that is the paradox that has not been illustrated. The UK is in a much more powerful position than most economists would assume.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin (who was in favour of leaving the EU) also suggested the UK consumers could vote with their wallets and shun French champagne and German beer. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also concerned that the UK government might wilt under the pressure of exiting the European Union, leading investors to lose faith in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal credibility. Kathrin Muehlbronner says: The UK will have to handle multiple, complicated policy decisions in areas including global trade, immigration and regulation. Given the magnitude and complexity of these decisions, the risk is material that some might damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic or fiscal strength. NEWSFLASH: Britain could suffer another credit rating downgrade if Theresa May fails to get a decent Brexit deal from Europe. In a new report, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says that it would slash Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating if UK companies lose \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore access\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the single market. It believes the terms at which Britain can trade with the rest of Europe after Brexit are crucial to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term prosperity. Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice-president at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service, says : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would downgrade the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating if the outcome of the negotiations with the EU was a loss of access to the Single Market as this would materially damage its medium-term growth prospects. A second trigger for a downgrade would be if we were to conclude that the credibility of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal policy had been tarnished as a result of Brexit or other reasons.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s singles out the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 currently enjoyed by the City, which allow banks in London to offer services across the EU. If these rights are lost, then it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating, but not enough to prompt a downgrade. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently rates the UK as Aa1, which is the second-highest rating. It downgraded the outlook on 24th June, in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum. In the report, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicts that the UK will carve out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some form of free trade agreement with the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One scenario that Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considers to be realistic is a series of accords offering access to the EU market for goods and more constrained access for services, in particular financial services. However, such an outcome is far from certain. Theresa May has said she intends to get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum possible access to the single market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while also bringing in new controls on immigration. However, European politicians have warned that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not prepared to sacrifice the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfour freedoms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - free movement of labour, capital, goods and services. And yesterday, an influential European MEP warned that Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a new trade deal until it has left the EU. Danuta H\u00c3\u00bcbner, a former Polish minister who became the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first European commissioner, told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Formally you cannot conclude or even negotiate the agreement that belongs to a third-country situation while you are still a member. Article 50 is only about withdrawal and only when you are out can [you] negotiate another agreement. Here are the key points from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would downgrade the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating if we were to conclude that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss of access to the Single Market would materially weaken medium-term growth. A second driver for the UK rating will be the fiscal outlook, on which we expect to obtain significantly more clarity with the upcoming Autumn Statement, scheduled for 23 November. A wide-ranging Free Trade Agreement which would limit the negative impact of Brexit on growth remains a plausible but not certain outcome. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative outlook for the UK banking system reflects Brexit-induced uncertainties, which are exerting pressure on the revenues, asset quality and profitability of all UK banks, although some are more resilient to such strains than others. Brexit-related loss of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passporting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rights for UK banks that operate across jurisdictions would be credit negative but manageable. The resulting higher costs and reduced inefficiencies are not sufficient to pressure the ratings. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up a nervous morning in the City: A fresh batch of pre-US election jitters has swept the markets this morning, investors fretting over news that Trump has taken the lead in a national poll. While Clinton is still ahead in the majority of surveys, the fact that the orange-faced Republican nominee has clawed his way back to being a potential victor in the aftermath of the FBI email scandal has sent a wave of fear through first the Asian markets, and now the European open. While that means the FTSE has dropped 30 points, taking it under 6900 for the first time in over a month, with the DAX and CAC also shedding 0.6% apiece, it has led to a moment of respite for the pound, which rose back above 1.22 against the weakened dollar. Some good news amid the gloom. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has posted its fastest growth in nearly three years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via data firm Markit, which reports that growth picked up across the region (apart from in poor old Greece, which suffered a contraction). The US dollar is having a bad morning, allowing the British pound some relief. Sterling has hit a two-week high of $1.227 this morning, as US election worries trump (ahem) Brexit fears. The dollar has also clattered to a three week low against the euro, a one-month low against the Swiss franc, and a two-week low against the Japanese yen. However, the US dollar has gained against emerging market currencies - such as the Mexican peso. Kit Juckes, currency expert of Societe Generale, says investors may struggle to work out the market implications of a Republican win next week: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see Trump as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Mexico in particular and for US trade-dependent economies in general but there are limits to what a President can legislate. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, where the potential medium-term economic damage of leaving the single market is much clearer. However, with less than a week to go, market opinion is coming to the conclusion that a Trump win would create too much uncertainty and is bad for risk sentiment generally. The odds on Donald Trump becoming the most powerful man in the world have narrowed recently, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still only a 27% shot at Betfair. However, you might remember that the Remain campaign had a healthy lead on 23 June, and we all know what happened next. Nervous investors are selling shares, and putting the money into government debt this morning, in another sign of Trump-related jitters. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driving up prices, and cutting the interest rate on the bonds. Reuters has the details: British government bond prices jumped on Wednesday, tracking U.S. and German debt prices higher as markets reacted to increased uncertainty about next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.S. presidential election. Ten-year gilt yields dropped more than 8 basis points on the day to a six-day low of 1.197%, while two-year yields fell nearly 6 basis points to 0.207%, their lowest since Oct. 21. The move in gilts and many other European government bonds followed a similar fall in U.S. Treasury yields as investors started to rethink their long-held bets of a victory for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on signs her Republican rival Donald Trump could be closing the gap. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed reckons markets are in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153early stages of panic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Investors are dumping risk assets this morning as latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking polls showed Trump ahead of Clinton for the first time. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s odds for winning the U.S. elections increased after the FBI reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a private server and he will maximise his leverage on the case with less than a week remaining to the election date. Most major Asian equity indices fell by more than 1%, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear index \u00e2\u20ac\u0153VIX\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soared above 20 levels for the first time since September 12. The Mexican peso which has become the popular election proxy also fell this morning, declining by more than 4.3% for the past six trading days. And with the dollar weakening, Sayed expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a roller coaster ride for the next couple of days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The post Brexit vote market reaction is still fresh in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 memory and no one wants to be caught on the wrong side of the trade, it will only take another one or two polls showing a Trump lead to boost markets anxiety and thus a steep sell off in equity markets and high beta currencies. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 index, which includes the 600 largest companies across the region, has hit its lowest level since 11 July. Every one of the main European stock market sectors is falling this morning, led by the banks: European stock markets have opened in the red, as US election angst hits the City. The FTSE 100 shed 40 points at the open, or 0.6%, to 6875. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since 30 September. Across the channel, shares are falling too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX lost 0.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC dropped 0.7%, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX shed 0.9%, and the Italian FTSE MIB is down 0.5%. This follows last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nervy session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones index closed down 100 points, and the overnight losses in Asia that drove the yen and gold higher. Mike van Dulken &amp; Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explain: Anxious investors the world over are pricing in an even tighter US election race, with increased fears of a Trump win next week and the political, economic and market uncertainty that would surely ensue. The probability of a Clinton win may remain high but a blindside Brexit result is also still very fresh in the memory of market participants. This chart show how investors are becoming more nervous (the white line), as the Mexican peso (seen as vulnerable to a Trump victory) has dropped (blue line). The yen is extending its gains against the US dollar as I type - hitting \u00c2\u00a5103.57 to the $1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest since October 21st. Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities, says Trump vs Clinton is now the number one issue worrying investors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming all about the U.S. elections. Markets are trying to factor in the changing atmosphere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are piling into safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen, after the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll put Trump in the lead. This sent the dollar down to 103.69 yen, from 104.14 on Tuesday night. The Mexican peso was another casualty, weakening to 19.31 to the US dollar, from 19.18 last night. Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, explains: The probability of a Trump victory has risen materially since last Friday. On FiveThirtyEight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s models it is back to 28\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30%, levels not seen since before the second debate and the controversial NBC video leak. Although Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances have been rising steadily since Friday, yesterday set off a scramble for election hedges. Stock markets are coming under pressure today as international investors become increasingly anxious about the US presidential election. In exactly one week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has won the race to the White House. And with the polls seemingly closing, shares are on the slide. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have fallen overnight, hitting their lowest level in seven weeks. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei fell by 1.7%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng lost 1.4%, and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX200 shed 1.1%. This followed losses on Wall Street last night, where stock market volatility hit its highest level since Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum in June. Gold, which usually rallies at times of anxiety, has hit a four-week high at $1,293.00 It was triggered by a new ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll which put Trump one point ahead. Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team swiftly dismissed it, saying the poll was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not what we see at all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to make traders edgy, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets: The surge in gold prices and the volatility index is the real reflection that traders have finally woken up to the reality that the US election does represent a significant risk, something they were completely ignorant about until now. European markets are also expected to dip today, says Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Hyde. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot coming up this morning, including new data showing how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders, fared last month. And later on today, the US central bank will end its two-day monetary policy meeting: 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI - expected to remain unchanged at 53.3 9.30am GMT: UK Construction PMI - expected to fall to 51.8, from 52.3 6pm: US Federal Reserve - expected to leave US interest rates on hold On the corporate front, the City are getting results from retailer Next, pub chain JD Wetherspoon, housebuilder Persimmon. And Nationwide, the estate agent, have just reported that house price growth stalled last month, pulling the annual rate of house price growth down to 4.6%, from 5.3% in September. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more on that later...",

Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the US election, if Hillary Clinton does manage to win next week, then the pound may continue to outperform the G10. The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view.</p> <p>Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in the near term.

Ahead of the November MPC meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers.</p> <p>We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England on growth but see inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019.

England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England abandoned plans for further cuts to interest rates as it conceded the economy had stood up to the shock of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote without the sharp slowdown Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted.</p> <p>The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought.

                "bodyText":"The pound is holding onto its gains, which were inspired first by the High Court vote on Brexit, and then by the Bank of England keeping interest rates on hold. It is now up 1.2% against the dollar at $1.2447, having been as high as $1.2494. Against the euro it is 1.19% better at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1217. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Bank of England governor Mark Carney - who let it not be forgotten has run into some political flak recently - has not yet applied for British citizenship, which he said he would when appointed, Sky is reporting: The High Court ruling that parliament should have a vote on Brexit put the cat among the pigeons, sending the pound soaring and the UK market lower. News that the Bank of England had kept interest rates on hold helped sterling keep much of its gains, and kept the pressure on shares. The FTSE 100 is dominated by exporters and overseas earners who have benefitted from a weak pound, so the reverse is also true. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 managed to gain ground despite the uncertainty. European markets outperformed the UK, helped by positive updates from ING, SocGen and Credit Suisse. The US was struggling for direction as investors fretted about the outcome of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. There was also one eye on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non farm payroll numbers. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 54.91 points or 0.8% at 6790.51 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,325.88 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.07% at 4411.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.33% to 16,419.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bucked the trend and ended 0.07% higher at 8879.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.57% to 578.23 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 8 points or 0.04%. The rise in the pound following the court ruling on Brexit and the Bank of England keeping interest rates on hold may not be the end of it, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. Sterling is currently up 1.25% against the dollar at $1.2450, and incidently, is also stronger against the euro, up 1.24% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1224. Brooks said: Although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the US election, if Hillary Clinton does manage to win next week, then the pound may continue to outperform the G10. The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view. Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in the near term. If this happens then we could see the pound/dollar move towards the 1.25-1.30 range between now and the Fed meeting in December. Back with the Bank of England and its forecast changes, Unicredit Research is now expecting UK interest rates to remain on hold next year. Daniel Vernazza, its lead UK economist, said: The tone of the Inflation Report, MPC minutes and the Governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference were notably \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than we had expected. In particular, the MPC said monetary policy could now move in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153either direction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to changes to the economic outlook, cancelling its guidance from August that a cut was the most likely next move. As a result, we have now cancelled our expectation for a cut in the bank rate in February next year. We now expect the MPC to remain on hold throughout 2017. So, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed in the last three months? First, economic activity has been much stronger than the BoE had expected...Second, the further depreciation of sterling since the beginning of October will push up inflation meaningfully over the forecast period. Skipping across the Atlantic for a moment, and news of a slowdown in US service sector growth, partly due to caution about next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. The ISM non-manufacturing index fell from 57.1 in September to 54.8 last month, below expectations of a level of 56. Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing survey committee, said: There has been a slight cooling-off in the non-manufacturing sector month-over-month, indicating that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increases weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sustainable. Respondent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments remain mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy. Several comments were made about the uncertainty on the impact of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile orders for manufactured goods rose by 0.3% in September, up from 0.4% the previous month, the third straight month of increases. Following the figures the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points or 0.2%. The dollar is still down against the pound, with sterling at $1.2453, up 1.26% following the High Court Brexit decision and the Bank of England deciding not to cut interest rates again. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit, is now forecasting UK interest rates to stay at 0.25% for some time. He also expects growth to be slower than the Bank is predicting but inflation to be higher: We are dropping our expectation that interest rates will be taken down to a low of 0.10% We now believe that it is more likely than not interest rates will stay at 0.25% for a prolonged period (very possibly to 2020). Ahead of the November MPC meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers. We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England on growth but see inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking around 3.5% around spring 2018. It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be adjusted. This follows recent comments by politicians that could be construed to threaten the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence as well as some attacks on Mr. Carney and the MPC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly on their stance on the risks from Brexit. The TUC is also worried that households face a severe wage squeeze next year, as the weaker pound drives up inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady fears Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford a second dose of falling real wages (as seems possible, if companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide inflation-busting pay rises). O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning must spur the government into action so that workers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the price of Brexit with a squeeze on wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK workers already suffered the largest fall in real wages after the financial crisis of any developed country except Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford another hit to their pay packets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor should use the Autumn Statement to protect jobs and wages, with new investment in infrastructure like roads, rail, green energy and homes. And the national minimum wage must be increased to keep it well ahead of inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfan chart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, showing how it expects inflation to romp upwards in 2017 and 2018. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, agrees with Mark Carney that households are going to find life tougher next year, as Brexit uncertainty continues to swirl. He says: GDP growth is likely to slow next year, on the back of a squeeze in real household incomes and ongoing Brexit uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story about how UK interest rates were left on hold today: As suspected, Mark Carney faced some robust questioning at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quarterly Inflation report. The governor found himself having to defend the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasting powers, after it almost doubled its forecast for 2017 growth (to 1.4%), just three months after slashing it drastically. He also repeatedly fended off questions about his own future, and whether he could possibly be lured to stay beyond June 2019. Personally I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d reject the chance for more meetings with the UK economics press pack. But what did we learn? 1) Life is going to get tougher, especially for poorer families. Carney warned that inflation will take a real bite out of earnings, saying: We see very modest real income growth over the course of next year and into 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the CPI rate is expected to surge to 2.7% in 2017, and hit 2.8% in 2018 -- which is higher than wage growth today. And he said the Bank is facing a balancing act between allowing inflation to rise over target (driving down real wages) and higher unemployment (which would happen if the Bank tightened monetary policy). 2) The economy is doing better than the Bank expected.... Alongside death and taxes, you can be pretty certain that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts will be tweaked before long. But still, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upward revisions to growth in 2016 and 2017 are quite significant - and show that the BoE was too gloomy about the immediate impact of voting to leave the EU. Carney painted a picture of serene calm: The MPC had expected consumption to continue to grow solidly throughout the remainder of 2016. But consumption has been even stronger, with households appearing to entirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties. For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and competitive. Confidence is solid. Indeed, he had to pour cold water on the suggestion that consumers are being stupid by still hitting the high street. 3)....but there are signs that things are getting worse The Bank still sees signs that firms are cutting back, as they watch Brexit play out: That uncertainty does bear down on business investment,that effect builds with time, that lower business investment has consequences for employment. 4) We should get used to Brexit uncertainty The governor said that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court ruling that MPs must vote on article 50 is simply an example of the drama we should get used to, as Britain leaves the EU. Obviously I am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the prospects here, but it is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The negotiations haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even yet begun, there will be uncertainty, there will be volatility around those negotiations as they proceed, and I would view this as one example of that uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 5) The next interest rate move could be up. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary schools are full of children who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even born when the Bank last raised interest rates (it was July 2007, just before the credit crunch). And a few months ago, many City economists were convinced rates would fall to 0.1% soon. Not any more, with the BoE dropping its guidance that the next move is probably down. As Carney puts it: You can envisage scenarios where it goes either way. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a bias in terms of direction of where the next move will be. Again, in a period of a fair bit of uncertainty you can envisage scenarios where either direction would be merited. Make of that what you will.... 6) The Bank of England isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at war with Downing Street. Asked about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of monetary policy, he argued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel under any pressure from the government,certainly none from the prime minister. I think the prime minister fully supports, and the government fully supports, the monetary policy framework we have in place and in that framework we take those decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And he also indicated he accepted criticism from MPs, as part of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accountability. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say whether some critics should take a vow of silence, alas. A final question.... is there an inflation level that would force the Bank to take action? Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be lured into setting a figure -- perhaps burned by his previous experience of forward guidance. It all depends what is causing prices to rise over target, and what the best response is. Q: Are consumers being short-sighted and stupid by still spending, and not realising how difficult things are going to get? Not at all - people still have jobs, and are behaving rationally, Mark Carney replies. Carney is then asked whether Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent criticism of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy, at the Tory party conference, has undermined him. Q: Does he feel any political pressure to change the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts? Not at all, he replies. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel under any pressure from the government, and especially not from the prime minister. The prime minister, and the government, fully support the monetary policy framework we have in place. Hugo Duncan of the Daily Mail tries to get some new forward guidance out of the governor. Q: Can you tell us whether the next move in interest rates is more likely to be up, or down? You can see scenarios where it goes either way, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a bias, Mark Carney replies. But the monetary policy committee currently unanimously believes that the present stance is right. Q: If the Brexit process isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completed by 2019, might you stay on longer? Carney repeats that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had enough talk about his future. And he then warns that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court ruling on article 50 is just one example of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153series of events\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will take place as Britain leaves the EU, creating uncertainty. Everything doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come together until relatively late in the process, and those effects will be there in the economy. Q: Should families who are just getting by be worried about your inflation forecasts [hitting 2.7% in 2017]? We expect inflation to go up, Carney states bluntly, and that will hit people in the pocket. But he then flags up that the Bank expects wage growth to be stronger by 2020. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a difficult period here, but it has to be put into context. Q: How much would the pound have to fall, and how fast, to concern you - and would you intervene in the currency markets? Carney says the BoE doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target the sterling exchange rate, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindifferent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to it. Ben Chu of the Independent takes the governor back to the recent criticism from pro-Brexit MPs, and the claim from former foreign secretary William Hague that central bankers had lost the plot. Q: Is this undermining Bank independence, and should your critics take a vow of silence? Carney grins, and slips into Canadian as he mutters \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jeez, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a trap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He then says there is a robust mechanism of accountability, including regular appearances before parliamentary committees. The debate should be as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvigorous\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as necessary. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that the MPC recognises the limits of its responsibilities, he adds. Q: Three months ago the Bank made major downward revisions to its growth forecasts, and today it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made major upward revisions. So is there a problem with your forecasting? Carney argues that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away with short-term revisions. Broadly speaking, the size of the UK economy is still expected to be roughly the same in two or three years as we thought in August. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent weighs in too, saying that most independent forecasters expected the economy would contract after the Brexit vote. That was more negative (and thus wronger) than the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecasts. Q: Could you be persuaded to stay at the Bank of England beyond 2019, if things are going well? I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all had enough of that saga, Carney shoots back, in an attempt to keep talk of his future nailed down [reminder, on Monday he agreed to serve one more year, until June 2019] Q: Does the recent news storm over your future show that the relationship between the government and the Bank needs to change? Carney argues that the current system, in which the government hands control of monetary policy to technocrats such as himself, is working. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the framework needs to change, i think it works quite well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: UK bond yields are up sharply since your stimulus package in August, so has it failed - and has monetary policy shot its bolt? No, Carney replies. He argues that the Bank could still buy more British gilts if needed. Carney denies that the Bank has got ahead of itself and been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presumptuous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by trying to predict the kind of Brexit deal that Britain will end up with. Q: The bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2018, so is the pain of Brexit simply being delayed? Carney replies that the Bank sees \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very modest real income growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2017 and 2018, as inflation eats into wages. Onto questions.... Q: Does this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court Article 50 court ruling [saying parliament must vote on the issue] add to the uncertainly overshadowing the UK economy? It is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process, Carney replies. The negotiations haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even begun. There will be volatility as those negotiations proceed. I see it as one of the examples of that uncertainty. Some instant reaction: In conclusion, Carney says that Britain has a dynamic, flexible economy, and that will help it handle the Brexit process. Carney says that the Bank of England can look through the prospect of inflation jumping over its target, for the wider good of the economy. But it cannot ignore inflation indefinitely. The fall in sterling appears to reflect market expectations that Britain will have a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcless open\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trading relationship with Europe, Carney continues. The governor warns that the slump in the pound will have more significant implications for inflation than for growth [in other words, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a net negative]. And Carney then warns that people are going to be hit in the pocket, saying: Modest supply growth ultimately means lower real income growth. The stimulus package announced by the Bank of England in August is working, Carney declared. He says credit is widely available, mortgage borrowing costs are lower, and unemployment is still low. But... financial markets have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcless sanguine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view of Brexit, he adds, pointing to the slump in the pound (down around a sixth since the referendum), and rising UK bond yields (a measure of government borrowing costs. Mark Carney begins by telling reporters that the terms of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is the most important single factor affecting the UK economy. That UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new relationship with the EU will be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest driver\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of medium-term prosperity, he adds. And he points out that economic demand has been stronger than expected in August. The Bank of England is holding a press conference right now. You can watch it here. Sterling has hit a new three-week high, and is now up almost two cents at $1.249. Traders are calculating that there is less chance of the BoE cutting interest rates further. Indeed, the Bank of England now points out that it could raise rates, not cut them, in future: It says: Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Here are the key points from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly forecasts and policy decision: Interest rates held at 0.25% and no change to scheme announced in August to pump additional \u00c2\u00a360bn in electronic cash into the economy to buy government bonds and \u00c2\u00a310bn to buy corporate bonds GDP growth in 2016 now expected to be 2.2%, up from 2.0% forecast in August GDP growth in 2017 now expected to be 1.4%, up from 0.8% forecast in August But GDP growth in 2018 now expected to be 1.5%, down from 1.8% forecast in August Inflation rises from 1.3% this year to 2.7% in 2017 and in 2018, higher than August forecasts Inflation eases back to 2.5% in 2019 and expected to return close to Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.0% target in 2020 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics reporter Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first take on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report: The Bank of England abandoned plans for further cuts to interest rates as it conceded the economy had stood up to the shock of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote without the sharp slowdown Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted. The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time is slightly worse than in August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook. The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in either direction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation. The Bank also said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England fears that the uncertainty over Brexit will push unemployment higher, from its current rate of 4.9% [There is a ] risk that UK-based firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5.5% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019. The Bank of England admits that the UK economy has outperformed its expectations in the three months since it slashed rates. It says: In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations [reminder: it was 0.5%, not 0.1%]. These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago. Household spending appears to have grown at a somewhat faster pace than projected in August, and the housing market has been more resilient than expected. By contrast, investment intentions have continued to soften and the commercial property market has been subdued. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a victory for Brexit campaigners who claimed the BoE was too gloomy about Brexit, argues The Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steve Hawkes. This chart shows how the Bank has hiked its inflation forecast, and is also more optimistic about growth next year: (these fan charts show the relative likelihood of various eventualities, with darker areas showing what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most likely) OUCH! The Bank of England sees inflation spiking sharply over the next couple of years. It now believes inflation will hit 2.7% in a years time (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 2.0% back at the August report) And the consumer prices index is expected to peak at 2.83% in the second quarter of 2018. The Bank of England has also hiked its growth forecasts for this year, and next year. It now says the UK economy will grow by 2.2% in 2016, up from 2% previously. And for 2017, it now sees growth of 1.4% -- sharply higher than the 0.8% it initially expected. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news, though. It has cut its 2018 growth forecast to 1.5%, from 1.8%. Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates on hold, at the current record low of 0.25%. The MPC has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00c2\u00a3425bn. Both decisions was unanimous, with the committee voting 9-0. Positive Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fran Boait wrote about the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPeople\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the Guardian last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: An idea that is gaining traction is that monetary and fiscal policy could work together to deliver \u00e2\u20ac\u0153monetary financing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Under this proposal, new money would be created by the Bank as with QE, but instead would be spent into the economy by the government to boost investment, employment and incomes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an idea known as people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE. This might sound radical, but currently, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered good if banks create money, regardless of whether they use it to lend to businesses or to blow up property bubbles. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered taboo if the central bank creates money to finance government spending for the real economy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to break that taboo. My colleague Katie Allen has captured some photos of the Positive Money protest against the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme this morning: As explained earlier, Positive Money want to stop the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing scheme, which is now creating \u00c2\u00a3425bn of new money. Instead, it wants the government to control the money-creation process. Positive Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Executive Director, Fran Boait says the BoE and the government should rethink monetary policy, rather than relying on QE and ultra-low interest rates. She told CNBC that: Since the crash we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had low interest rates, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created one of the slowest recoveries in history. Just 30 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its decision on interest rates, and unveils its new economic forecasts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what to watch for: Has the BoE cut rates to fresh record lows? (it probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) Has it boosted its stimulus programme? (also unlikely, as there are no signs that Britain is falling into recession). Has it raised its growth forecasts? In August, the Bank predicted that growth would slow to a miserable 0.8% in 2017. That now looks too pessimistic, given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies appear to be growing quite strongly. How about inflation? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now clear that the weak pound is driving up import costs; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to hit consumers hard next year. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over the horizon? The Bank could conclude that leaving the EU vote will damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term economic prospects (but until we know more about Brexit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to know). And then the City will hang on governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every word at the press conference, from 12.30pm. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, says: The market is eagerly awaiting the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Report, which should bring further clarity as to likely path of monetary policy in the months ahead. We expect the BoE to leave policy unchanged at the midday announcement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City traders believe that the High Court ruling on article 50 will trigger even more wild drama in the currency markets. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, predicts that the pound will be volatile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historic announcement that the UK government has lost the Brexit case in High Court means that Parliament must vote on whether to trigger Article 50. Theresa May claims this is a subversion of justice whilst \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaigners will be thrilled; one thing is for certain that current market volatility will be heightened. The government will appeal to the Supreme Court, however if they agree with the High Court judgement there could be a big impasse with no clear route for resolution. The pound which was already rising spiked further on the news and no doubt there will be further repercussions in the markets, as we await the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement at midday today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has pushed the pound to its highest level since last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, when sterling slumped alarmingly in Asian trading to just $1.15. But as this chart shows, sterling is still weaker than in September - before the Conservative Party conference ignited fears that Britain could lose membership of the single market after Brexit: At these low levels, the pound appears to be priced for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal tweets: One thing is certain - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mighty difficult to have much faith in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic forecasts in the current political climate. How can its finest minds predict UK growth and inflation in such an uncertain climate? (reminder, the Bank releases the quarterly inflation report at noon) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains why sterling has spiked this morning - and why the City is struggling to decide what happens next: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The High Court ruling on Article 50 is a body blow for Theresa May and the Brexit-leaning ministers at the heart of government. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made triggering Brexit a lot trickier and has given sterling a massive shot in the arm. The stage is now set for a fresh battle over Brexit and there is the prospect that Parliament will block Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU, albeit a dim and distant one for now. We need to get more clarity on what MPs think and intend to do about this now they have a say. In a year of political surprises, who would bet against another one? A massive grass-roots Remain campaign could tilt the balance. The news sent the pound roaring through $1.24 before gains were pared as markets digest the news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fact is no one really knows what the implications of this decision are yet. An appeal is coming in early December, so this is not final. Cable was last at $1.2432, its highest level in almost a month. Even if Article 50 is triggered as planned, this judgment could underpin sterling for some time and assuage fears about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if the pro-EU camps in Parliament start to dictate terms to the government in return for voting with the people. We could see this create a floor under the pound around $1.25. Politics and uncertainty continue to drive the currency markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our diplomatic editor: The pound is trading at a three-week high against the US dollar, as everyone ponders the ramifications of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat (which we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re liveblogging here) Some experts are predicting that parliament would give its approval for Article 50 be triggered, rather than ignore the result of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not definite. The court ruling may make it harder for Theresa May to start the process by March 2017, and could even encourage the PM to hold an early general election... The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Barker sums it up: Newsflash: The government has lost the Brexit case in the high court. Judges have ruled that Theresa May does not have the power to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote. This sent the pound surging over $1.24, before swiftly dropping back... as the Supreme Court will now hear an appeal, in early December. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Marki, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Service sector PMI report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An encouraging picture of the economy gaining further growth momentum in October is marred by news that inflationary pressures are rising rapidly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business activity is growing at a rate consistent with solid economic growth of 0.4-0.5% in the fourth quarter (the surveys suggest the initial 0.5% GDP growth estimate for the third quarter could be revised slightly lower). What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s especially reassuring is that growth is also becoming more balanced. Manufacturing is leading the expansion as exporters benefit from the weaker pound, but services growth is also reviving and construction is being boosted by renewed house building. But... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ugly flip-side of the weaker pound is clearly evident, however, with the rate of increase of service providers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs showing the largest monthly acceleration seen in 20 years of survey data collection. Costs are consequently rising at the fastest rate for over five years. If sustained, the increase in prices threatens to curb both corporate hiring and consumer spending, as firms seek to reduce staff costs and households see their pay eroded by rising inflation. As such, Williamson doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the Bank of England will launch any new stimulus measures soon - and will keep its powder dry in case the economy deteriorates. This jump in service sector growth means that all three sectors of the UK economy expanded in October. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already learned this week that manufacturing growth slowed sightly, while construction activity surged. Altogether, it shows that growth is accelerating - as firms put the immediate shock of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum behind them, and get a boost from the weaker pound. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has just posted its fastest growth since January, but there are also worrying signs that inflation is building. Data firm Markit says that total business activity accelerated in October, as did new business expansion. Firms also kept hiring more workers, to deal with a flurry of new business. Companies reported that they are seeing more demand from overseas thanks to the weak pound. This drove up the services PMI, Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of activity, up to 54.5 in October - up from 52.6 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since January, suggesting the economy is continuing to grow fairly solidly. David Noble, group CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging sign: Concerns over the EU referendum result showed some signs of dissipating as respondents commented on a re- focus on opportunities and ramped up marketing and sales promotions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, business optimism remained lukewarm in spite of the spike in new orders and was below the long-term average of the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Staffing levels showed a moderate improvement but at weaker levels than seen over the past three years. However... firms also reported that import costs are rising very steeply. Input price inflation surged to the highest since March 2011 -- and with the biggest month-on-month jump ever. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the weak pound, and is another sign that UK inflation is going to spike in the months ahead -- as firms pass these costs onto consumers. Noble explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The exchange rate on the pound continued to be a blessing and a curse as opportunities for more export-related activity such as tourism improved. On the other hand, input price inflation accelerated to a level not seen since March 2011 as healthy margins were challenged. Higher food and fuel prices were highlighted. Our Politics Live blog is tracking the article 50 ruling: My colleague Alice Ross is braving the autumn chill.... Today will be a crucial day for the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bound to be volatile at noon, when the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new growth and inflation forecasts hit the wires. Mark Carney could also move sterling, when he speaks to the press at 12.30pm. Lee Hardman, Currency Analyst at MUFG, say the pound could rally if the Bank suggests further rate cuts are unlikely: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect Governor Carney to reiterate in the accompanying press conference that the BoE is not indifferent to weakness in the pound. Delivering a rate cut in the near-term could prove counter-productive if it further destabilises the pound and triggers another lurch lower increasing upside risks to inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And in just 30 minutes time, the High Court will rule on whether MPs must get a vote on whether to trigger article 50. Hardman says the pound will spike if judges say parliament should have its say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that a judgement in favour of requiring a vote in parliament to trigger Article 50 could trigger a sizeable short squeeze higher for the pound in the near-term. It would help ease the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current elevated level of pessimism regarding the risk of a harder Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A small protest is taking place outside the Bank of England, by campaigners who oppose its bond-buying quantitative easing programme. The group, called Positive Money, believe that the government should take back the ability to make and distribute money from the commercial banks (who currently create money whenever they issue a loan). Here are some photos: Positive Money argue that the current levels of inequality, personal debts, and high government borrowing all stem from the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 control of the money-printing. As they put it: We believe the power to create money must be removed from the banks that caused the financial crisis and returned to a democratic, transparent and accountable body. New money must only be created and used to benefit the public and society as a whole, rather than just financial sector. City economist and author George Cooper isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced you can actually create money without debt*, but still welcomes their contribution to the debate.... * - basically because money is (among other things) transferrable credit (as explained here) This chart shows how the Bank of England only expected the UK to grow by 0.1% in the last three months; data last week showed growth of 0.5%. But Bloomberg also show how the public are already anticipating higher prices in the shops: Kallum Pickering of Berenberg expects the Bank of England to say that growth and inflation in 2017 will both be higher than previously forecast. This charts shows his new charts, vs the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s August forecasts: He also expects Mark Carney to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake stock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the UK economy today, rather than announce any more stimulus moves. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to provide extra liquidity around the vote and then to announce a suitably large monetary stimulus in response to the sharp downgrades in the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook was appropriate. A central bank needs to satisfy the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 need for liquidity during periods of stress to limit the risk that a modest crisis turns into a severe one. But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better-than-expected economic performance since the vote has removed the need for the BoE to act again. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics believes the Bank of England will predict that inflation will rise to 2.2% in 2017, up from the 1.9% it forecast in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than double September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading of 1.0%. For 2018, he thinks the BoE will forecast inflation of 2.6%, up from 2.3% three months ago, and some way above its 2% target. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual for the Bank to predict that it will miss its own inflation target; it usually calculates that it will have adjusted monetary policy to get CPI in line (it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always achieve this, of course). Tombs says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The [Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] forecast for CPI inflation in two years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time will be the highest since it began forecasting the CPI 12 years ago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Labour MP Angela Eagle fears that living standards are about to be squeezed. Sterling is rising in early trading, as investors await news from the Bank of England at noon. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.3% at $1.2345, on track for its fifth \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a row. A few months back, many City economists were predicting the Bank would cut interest rates to a fresh record low today. But, with the economy performing better than feared since June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and signs that the weak pound is pushing up inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost everyone expects the BoE to leave borrowing costs at 0.25%. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains: Only 2 out of 58 economists polled by Bloomberg expect the BOE to cut interest rates at this meeting. The market is currently pricing in a mere 5% chance of a rate cut on Thursday, back in September there was a 25% chance of a cut. As UK inflation and growth have both beat forecasts in recent weeks, UK interest rate expectations have drifted higher. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Super Thursday - the time each quarter when the Bank of England sets interest rates, issues its new assessment of the UK economy, and submits its governor for a grilling from the UK economics press. And Mark Carney may have a lot of explaining to do. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the Bank is expected to revise up its short-term growth forecasts; an admission it was too gloomy about the impact of the Brexit vote. Back in August, the BoE said growth would slow sharply to just 0.1% in July-September; actually, it was a robust 0.5%. Carney could say the stimulus measures taken by the Bank are having an effect, but critics will continue to argue that he were too gloomy about Brexit. Some economists expect the BoE to lower its medium-term growth forecasts, as it tries to assess the impact of Britain leaving the EU. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tricky calculation, as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what kind of deal the UK will end up with. The Bank may also hike its inflation forecasts, as the slump in the pound since June continues to push up the cost of imports. That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year. If that happens, how long will the Bank be prepared to ignore the rising cost of living? And of course, Carney can expect several questions about his decision to extend his term by an extra 12 months, to summer 2019. Has the criticism from pro-Brexit MPs deterred him from staying until 2021? And has the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence been undermined? Ranjiv Mann, head of global sovereign research &amp; Strategy at Rogge Global Partners, expects Carney to revise up his 2016 growth forecast, but still sound cautious. He says: We expect another 9-0 vote to leave monetary policy unchanged Sterling depreciation is set to send CPI inflation above the 2% inflation target in 2017/18 However, the Bank will want to affirm its easing bias, particularly if it lowers its projections for medium term growth prospects The interest rate decision comes at noon, along with the quarterly inflation report Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference begins at 12.30pm, and runs for an hour. Also coming up today.... There will be high drama at 10am, when the UK high court rules on whether Theresa May can start the process of exiting the EU without a parliamentary vote. Owen Bowcott, our legal affairs correspondent, sets the scene: The lord chief justice is to deliver the high court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s momentous decision on whether parliament or the government has the constitutional power to trigger Brexit. After less than three weeks considering the politically charged case with two other senior judges, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd will read out a summary of their decision at 10am on Thursday to a packed courtroom in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Courts of Justice. In order to prevent leaks of the market-sensitive ruling, which involves a large number of parties, preliminary drafts of the judgment have unusually not been sent out in advance to the lawyers. The outcome of the case, which ventures into constitutionally untested ground, will resolve whether MPs or ministers have the authority to formally inform Brussels about whether the UK intends to leave the European Union. On the corporate front, supermarket Morrisons, insurance chain RSA gold miner Randgold and food group Tate &amp; Lyle are all reporting to the City. At 9.30am, we find out how fast Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector grew last month. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of US economic data this afternoon, including a healthcheck on the Service sector for October, and factory orders for September.",

Stephan Weil, the state premier of Lower Saxony who shares a seat on the carmaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supervisory board with P\u00c3\u00b6tsch, declined to comment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of respect to the ongoing investigation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Adding to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes on Sunday, German media reported that a US regulator had found another cheat device aimed at lowering carbon dioxide emissions in cars made by VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Audi subsidiary. Bild am Sonntag said the software lowered carbon dioxide emissions by detecting whether a car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steering wheel was turned as it would be if it was driving on a road. If the steering wheel was not turned, as if it was being tested in a laboratory, the software activated a gear-shifting programme that produced less carbon dioxide, allowing the car to meet the emissions criteria.",

Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright.<br></p> <p>Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen....<br></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-turnout-latino-vote\">Clinton campaign buoyed by high Latino turnout in election's final hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in the morning with more market action.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially Democrat-controlled \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alter investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact.

                "bodyText":"DING DING! Wall Street has just posted its best day since the start of March, as the closing bell brings today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally to a halt. Predictions of a Hillary Clinton election victory have cheered the markets, ending a nine-day losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 371 points, or 2.08%, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 2.1%. The tech stock-heavy Nasdaq index gained almost 2.5%, as investors piled back into shares. This followed a strong rally in Europe, where London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 posted a triple-digit gain. Chris Beauchamp of IG says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a buying stampede today: According to the IG binary market, IG clients think Hillary remains the favourite, with her chances of election holding at 81%.* US assets have been heavily bid throughout the day, as the nine-day selloff is banished to distant memory. With around 36 hours to go until the result becomes known, there is plenty of potential for upsets however, and we may see the bullish move falter tomorrow if the battleground states remain in close contention. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been covering in this blog since early morning, the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to clear Hillary Clinton over her email server has given the Democratic candidate a last-minute lift. But.... this race is not over, even if some investors are acting like Clinton is home and dry. Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania will determine who wins the White House. And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of our latest news story: The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination battles began \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the rustbelt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep economic divide. Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-immigration rhetoric. But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright. Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen.... Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in the morning with more market action. Goodnight! GW The Dow Jones industrial average is pushing even higher in the final few minutes of trading, and is now up 2%..... I knew there was something important coming up. Thanks, AP! Shares in shipping, logistics and transport companies are having a particularly good day, sending the Dow Jones Transportation Average up by 2.8% in late trading. The index has gained 19% since January, which is significant as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often seen as a bellwether for the wider economy (companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ship as much if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re losing business). Analysts reckon that the transport sector would do well under a Clinton or Trump presidency, as both have promised spending on infrastructure. Marketwatch has more details. The British pound continues to be buffeted by the sudden strength of the US dollar today. Sterling has shed one cent, or 0.9%, today and is currently hovering around $1.24. The dollar is up around 0.75% against a basket of currencies today, including the euro and the yen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (yet) another sign that investors are pricing in a Clinton victory. Constellation Brands, which imports beers such as Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Corona, has joined the Mexican Peso as a surprise proxy for Trump success. Shares in Constellation have jumped by 4% today, having fallen pretty steadily through November. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-Mexico rhetoric has worried many US firms who import from Mexico, as he has pledged to shake up trade links between the two countries. With less than 90 minutes to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still on a tear and on track for its best day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading since March. Signs that Hillary Clinton has a better chance of winning tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election are driving share higher, despite many polls suggesting she only has a narrow lead over Donald Trump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation on the trading floors: Dow Jones: up 335 points or 1.8% at 18,223 S&amp;P 500: Up 43 points or 2% at 2,128 Nasdaq: Up 111 points or 2.4% at 4,771 With Clinton seen as the more status quo option, investors are aware that the markets could tumble if Donald Trump stages a surprise victory. Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see another 5 percent bump on a Clinton win, but I could see a 5 to 7 percent pullback on a Trump win.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The gold price is continuing to slide today, as traders put their money into riskier assets. Bullion is down 1.8% right now at $1,280 per ounce, down from $1,304 on Friday night. Our colleagues in America are relentlessly live-blogging the final day of the campaign. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already covered of a speech by president Barack Obama, fears of voter suppression in North Carolina, and analysis of how often each candidate has fibbed during the campaign race.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally has added tens of billions of dollars to the wealth of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people. Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks those with more money then they could possibly know what to do with, has jumped by 0.9% today to $4.4 trillion, a gain of $37bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Jeff Bezos, gained $2.7bn, while Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richesst man, Carlos Slim, gained a far from slimline $2.2nbn. Well done chaps. And now we know who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suffer if the markets have a meltdown on Wednesday..... Stock markets could plunge by over 5% on Wednesday if Trump beats Clinton, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Derek Halpenny. He was speaking to Sky News a few minutes ago: The S&amp;P 500 index has jumped by 2% today, which puts it on track for its best one-day performance since March this year. That would also reverse nine-days of losses, which accelerated after FBI chief James Comey sensationally revealed that the agency was investigating a new set of emails related to Hillary Clinton. The oil price has also risen today, with the price of a barrel of New York light crude gaining 0.6% to $44.34. The rally is partly due to Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved prospects in the election, now that the FBI have cleared her of criminal wrongdoing over those emails. Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, summed up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little bit less of a concern about the economy falling apart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why financial investors worldwide are wary of Trump: Each of the 30 shares on the Dow Jones index has risen so far today, as investors pour money back into stocks. United Healthcare is leading the rally, up 3.2%, followed by tech firms Microsoft and Intel, and banking giants JP Morgan and Goldman. Supermarket titan WalMart is bringing up the rear, with a 0.4% gain. And this has sent the Dow up by a chunky 350 points, or 1.96%. Although some pollsters say the election looks tight, New York traders are calculating that Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of victory have risen since the FBI cleared her over her email server last night. And Clinton continues to be seen as a more attractive candidate by Wall Street than Donald Trump, given (among other things) his opposition to trade deals. Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, explains (via Reuters) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clinton is a known quantity and investors hate uncertainty and they are very happy even if taxes were to go up ... In the case of Trump, it is uncertain as to what he stands for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Volatility on Wall Street has fallen to its lowest level since the Brexit vote, in another sign that investors are more relaxed about the election. One letter was all it took to send stock markets sharply higher. The news that FBI director James Comey had written to Congress to say Hillary Clinton had no case to answer over the latest batch of contentious emails boosted her chances against Donald Trump and sent investors scrabbling to buy shares. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 113.64 points or 1.7% higher at 6806.90, its biggest one day rise since 2 September Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.93% to 10,456.95 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.91% higher at 4461.21 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 2.56% to 16,736.75 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.45% at 8918.8 In Athens, the Greek market added 1.16% to 580.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 344 points or 1.93%. Whoever wins the US election, the initial market reaction may not last long, according to Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Simon MacAdam. He said: In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long. Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen. The flip-side is that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings. As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially Democrat-controlled \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alter investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries. And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said: There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president. Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000. Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday has proceeded in a way eerily similar to the scenes before the Brexit back in June. In the run-up to the referendum the markets saw a last minute surge as investors prepared to Britain to remain in the EU, only to suffer a shock when the votes were counted. The market has a bit more time to steady itself before the results of the election are announced; as the US electorate head to the polls tomorrow it will be interesting to see whether investors opt for continued Clinton confidence, sensible stability, or a sharp turn Trump-wards. And here, courtesy of Nomura, is a look at how the last four US elections played out (timings Eastern time): Former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan - he of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational exhuberence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - is critical of both candidates in terms of their economic acumen: Here are the biggest risers on Wall Street so far: As expected, US markets are moving ahead now Hillary Clinton has been cleared by the FBI over her emails, improving her prospects a day before the election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 250 points while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.6%. If you want to follow the last day of campaigning in the presidential election, our US blog has the coverage: Just under half an hour until Wall Street opens, and the futures are predicting a sharp rise following the latest election news: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a guide to which states report when: Memories of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum are still quite raw in the City of London. Investors vividly remember seeing the pound suffer an almighty slump on June 24th this year, falling from $1.50 to $1.36 in a single panic-driven session. Could Trump vs Clinton offer a repeat performance? Not if the polls are right...but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the Remain campaign held a clear lead as Brits cast their votes. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: There is always an element of Deja Vue effect, which we had during Brexit. Right now, the base case for markets is that Clinton will win the election. This is the biggest worry for us and the possibility of surprise should not be undermined. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory will not only bring the knee jerk reaction for the market, but we are also concerned about the geopolitical uncertainty. So far looking at the Mexican peso, it is very clear that traders are respecting the reliability of the US polls. The US polling has a much better track record predicting that who is in the lead and who will be in the Oval Office. There is huge money involved in this process and they pay attention to every grain in reflecting the results. Bloomberg have also knocked up a cheat sheet showing how a Trump win would be bad for shares and the US dollar, but good for gold. Analysts at Dutch bank ING say the US dollar will rally against the euro and the yen if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, while the Mexican Peso would also surge. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the opposite story if Trump triumphs - although in both cases it also depends what happens on Capitol Hill. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheat sheet: They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also produced this map, showing how Pennsylvania and Florida could be the key to the contest. If Trump loses one, he needs the other plus four more key swing states: Investors betting on a Clinton victory should remember the 24th June, when the Leave campaign defied the pollsters and won Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum It could happen again this week, warns Luke Hickmore, senior fixed income fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets are edging towards Clinton largely because of polling and we saw in the Brexit referendum how wrong that can be. The memory of that referendum should loom large in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 memories because so much of the polling was wrong then.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (quote via Reuters) OK, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast time in America (on the easterly side of the country, anyway) so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly recap. Stock markets have rallied strongly this morning after Hillary Clinton received a late boost in her bid to become US president. Shares have jumped in Asia and Europe, following the news that the FBI have found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing over her private email server. Investors are calculating that FBI James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement raises the chances that Clinton beats Donald Trump to the White House. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re putting money into shares, and taking it out of safe assets such as gold and the Japanese yen. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation: FTSE 100: Up 96 points or 1.4% at 6789 German DAX: Up 170 points or 1.6% at 10429 French CAC: Up 76 points or 1.75% at 4454 Wall Street traders are expected to send share prices romping higher when trading begins in a couple of hours. This follows nine days of consecutive losses, as election uncertainty has bitten. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called up 229 points, or over 1.2%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Looking ahead to the US open and it seems that there is going to be a rare example of the Dow Jones and dollar both heading in the same direction this afternoon. With the greenback already on a tear the Dow is expected to rise more than 200 points after the bell, putting it back above the 18000 it fell below last week. The US dollar is enjoying a strong rally, and is up one cent against the British pound at $1.242. But the Mexican peso is doing even better; which also suggests traders are cutting the chances of a surprise Trump victory. New polls have given Clinton the edge in the national polls, with Bloomberg giving her a three-point lead. But key battleground stakes such as Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida will determine the battle. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City trading firm IG, says European stock markets are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in a buoyant mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following the FBI announcement. The big question is whether this announcement will have a material effect upon the outcome of the US election, which is clearly perceived to be the case according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction. But investors are also nervous, especially given the recent Brexit shock: With the IG binary now showing an 83.5% chance of a Clinton victory (up from Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 74%), it is clear that traders expect this announcement to have a substantial impact upon the election result. However, if the EU referendum taught us anything, it is to not be complacent when there is a vote against a campaign which appeals to the disaffected and marginalised section of a population. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another poll, giving Hillary Clinton the edge: This is helping to keep stock markets buoyant today....and possibly setting investors up for a big fall on Wednesday, if the polls are wrong. Investors (and concerned citizens) across Europe need to decide whether to pull an all-nighter to follow the US election, or get up extra-early to see the result. Based on the last four elections... we can say that the results could be in by 5am GMT (or midnight in New York), if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decisive win for either candidate. In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama has given his victory address before the London stock markets had opened. But in 2004, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the result until around lunchtime in New York, when the City of London was winding down for the day. And the 2000 race between George W Bush and Al Gore wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decided for a month - following legal challenges over the result in Florida. Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura say: Hopefully by 4am to 5am (GMT) on Wednesday we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a good idea, but if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it could be another 12 hours (or more) from then. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created some handy graphics to show how the last four races ended, and how this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could play out: Just in: Clinton holds a three point lead over Trump, according to a Bloomberg poll conducted between Friday and Sunday. There are two scenarios in which the US election could spark a stock market rout, says Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser of investment giant Allianz. The first, unsurprisingly enough, is that Donald Trump becomes US president, sending share prices sliding as investors fear for the future. El-Erian explain why, in an article for Bloomberg. An equity market selloff is likely should Donald Trump win the presidential vote and also reaffirm his intention to move quickly on policy positions that disrupt long-standing trade relationships (such as tariffs on China and Mexico and the revocation of the North American Free Trade Agreement). The selloff would be larger if he also were to also create uncertainty about the future shape of the financial system, such as by calling for an immediate repeal of the Dodd-Frank legislation without offering a credible alternative. The second scenario is that Hillary Clinton wins the White House, and the Democratic party takes control of Congress. That would clear the way for reforms to clean up the energy sector, and price controls on biotech companies, along with higher government borrowing to boost growth. The other tail event, a Clinton win combined with a Democratic sweep of Congress, would likely bring about an equity market selloff that would entail more pronounced moves for certain sectors (such as pharmaceuticals and traditional energy). Bond markets would also come under pressure because of the higher probability of fiscal stimulus. World First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Jeremy Cook, has taken a stab at how tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election may play out: Every European stock market has jumped by at least 1% today, led by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB index, setting the scene for a Wall Street rally: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally shows that Hillary Clinton deserves her reputation as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favoured candidate, says Yann Quelenn, market analyst at online bank Swissquote. He writes: This morning, the US elections is definitely the financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 barometer. Futures on the S&amp;P are up 1.3% at the moment and we should see a good day on stocks. This relief rally is definitely proving the fact that markets are clearly supporting Hillary, justifying her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Candidate of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moniker. Consequently, a Clinton win would spark a significant relief rally in overly-bearish positioned markets. Queleen also reminds us that the US stock market just racked up a nine-day losing streak, for the first time in 36 years, as panicky investors fled the trading floors. The US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resurgence has brought the British pound back to earth with a bump, and back below $1.24. Sterling rallied strongly last week, on hopes that the UK government might negotiate a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. It got a real lift on Thursday, after the high court ruled that prime minister Theresa May can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trigger the exit process without parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval. But the dollar now has the upper hand, following the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. And that shows the US election is a more immediate concern than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness continues to push shares higher in London, as it means international-focused firms who earn money in US dollars will benefit. Since June, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a clear pattern that the FTSE rises when the pound fall, and vice versa, as Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: Driving the FTSE 100 higher today are the big foreign-earners like drug companies, miners, oil producers and HSBC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bank makes up over 5% of the FTSE 100 by index weight so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% rise is helping the blue chip index in no small way. Back in the UK, the Halifax bank has reported that British house prices jumped by 1.4% last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much stronger than expected, and something of a surprise as rival lender Nationwide has already decided that prices were flat in October. It may mean that households aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU, says Rob Weaver of property crowdfunding platform Property Partner. The market suffered an initial wobble post-Brexit but is proving resilient, mostly the result of the severe supply shortage that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping to prop up prices. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the Mexican peso rallied hard overnight, as the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement hit the wires: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that the US stock market is on track for a pre-vote bounce: Gold is getting a hammering this morning, as fears of a Trump presidency recede. The gold price has dropped by 1.4% to $1.286 per ounce, ending its recent rally. Gold had benefitted from anxiety over the US election, with investors looking for somewhere safe to put their money. You can almost hear the sigh of relief from the City, as fears over the US election subside. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Election fears be damned! The European markets roared into life this Monday following a bit of good news for the Clinton campaign.... The thinking will be that this news may well swing any undecided voters back towards Clinton, therefore lifting her already substantial chances of winning Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. However, regular readers may remember that the stock markets also rallied on June 23rd, on predictions that the Remain campaign would win the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite turn out like that, as Campbell reminds us: Given that Trump-fears were what dragged the market down at the end of last week it is understandable that the markets have seen such explosive gains after the bell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though, it must be noted, there were similar scenes before the Brexit back in June. Financial analysts say that the markets are betting on a Hillary Clinton win this morning, after the FBI gave the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall-clear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last night. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement from the FBI that there was nothing new in the latest batch of Clinton emails, has swung market sentiment back towards a Clinton win and risk is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whether voters see it that way, we\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll see soon enough. Gold, yen are down; yields, equities, oil and the dollar are up. Sean Callow, a senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market rally shows that investors are worried about a Trump victory: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Clinton win would clear the decks for the Fed to raise rates in December and for markets to price in a more aggressive profile for tightening over 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The surge in U.S. equity futures and slide in the gold price reinforces the evidence that a Trump win is seen as negative for global growth and profits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Rachel Cunliffe, deputy editor of news website Reaction, points out that Clinton may still be damaged: Wall Street is expected to join the rally when trading begins in around six hours time. The futures market is predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average will gain 230 points, or 1.2%. Banks and natural resource stocks are leading the rally in London, driven by bets that Hillary Clinton is on track for victory. Mining giants BHP Billiton, Antifagasta, Rio Tinto and Glencore are all among the risers, along with HSBC (which posted financial results this morning). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re driving the FTSE 100 up sharply in early trading, with only a handful of stocks struggling. Henry Croft of Accendo Markets says the rally is triggered by Hillary Clinton getting the all clear from the FBI for a second time. Polls are indicating Clinton pulling away slightly, although her lead remains well below the levels pre-FBI investigation. The election will be the driving force for markets before Wednesday morning. Of course, the internationally-focused FTSE 100 index also benefits from the weak pound (which has shed a whole cent this morning to $1.241). Ding Ding! European stock markets are rallying, as traders react to the overnight news from America. In the City, the FTSE 100 blue-chip index has jumped by 100 points, or 1.5%. There are similar gains in Paris and Frankfurt, as money pours into riskier assets - and out of save havens like gold and the Japanese yen. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to clear Clinton (again) could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgame changer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the race for the White House. But investors will wonder how much damage has already been done, in the nine days after James Comey announced that a new set of emails were being examined. Brooks says: The Clinton camp will be hoping that the reopening of the FBI investigation, which turned out to be for nothing, put off not too many early voters. Ultimately it all rests on the Electoral College votes, and in this area Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead looks solid, but not as insurmountable as it once did. She is predicted to win 216 votes, vs. 164 for Trump. However, we expect her lead to widen once more, if the latest FBI announcement translates into more Electoral College votes on Monday, as we expect. She adds that traders won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be counting Donald Trump out of the race, though: You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out Trump, and the risk of shy Trump voters disrupting polling expectations in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio remains a known unknown in this election race. For markets this is ultimately the key concern \u00e2\u20ac\u201c traders don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any special insight into this outcome of this election and this may limit market cheer at the start of this week on the back of Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email scandal being put to bed (again.) Traders may prefer to sit on the sidelines until the actual result is called The US dollar is on a tear this morning, following after the FBI confirmed that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring charges against Hillary Clinton over emails related to her personal email server. The greenback has gained 0.7% against the euro, and almost 0.9% against the pound, in a broad-based rally against other leading currencies. But the Mexican peso is actually gaining ground against the dollar. It rises whenever Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory chances fall, given the Republican nominee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to build a large wall on the US border. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. After a particularly lengthy and bloody battle, the US presidential race is heading into its final hours. In 48 hours time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably know whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have claimed the White House. And shares are rallying across the world after Clinton got a late boost -- with FBI director James Comey announcing that he will not bring charges against the Democratic candidate after examining a new set of emails. Comey told Congress last night: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camp has welcomed the news that Comey has confirmed his initial decision back in July (although they must still be irked that the FBI chief shook up the campaign nine days ago by announcing that the emails were being probed). Trump reacted in a fairly predictable manner - crying foul and claiming that the FBI couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually review 650,000 emails in eight days. Either way, Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement has sparked a wave of buying, as investors around the globe calculated that Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of success have risen. Shares have jumped in Asia, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 1.6%. And European and US markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 tipped to jump by 1%. The US dollar is also gaining. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: The US dollar has rebounded and equity markets look likely to follow suit this morning, after both fell heavily last week on fears about the unknown quantity a Trump win would mean. As the more status quo candidate, Clinton is definitely the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferred winner; she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less likely to provoke a global trade war or destabilise the geopolitical order by pulling back from Nato (Trump has suggested members of the alliance should pay for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protection). Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Janet Yellen, have also alarmed investors. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The question which traders are concerned about is whether a Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory can really topple the investor confidence in the market? Well, that depends on if he will be a typical politician or not. If he sticks to his words and fires Janet Yellen from her job, the market is going to see that as a massive event of uncertainty.... Also, if he increases the trade tariffs, it will impact the growth in China and Mexico (this is where he has the strongest view). The spill over effects will not only be limited to emerging markets, but also in the developed markets as well. Also coming up today.... Although the US election is the main event, the City will also get some new economic data to digest 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price index, showing how the UK property market performed in October 9.30am: Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of eurozone investor confidence for November 10am: Eurozone retail sales for September We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000.

Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

                "bodyText":"The financial markets are now closed, with investors having pushed shares higher in Europe and the US today on predictions that Hillary Clinton is poised to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next president. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mistaken, and the polls are wrong, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be an almighty panic when everyone returns to their desks. Oxford Economics say we can expect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate gains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Clinton wins, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant selloff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. In short, markets have already spoken. Equities will be the asset class that will gain the most in case of a Clinton win and equally lose the most if Donald Trump moves into the White House. Bond markets will likely rally a bit if Trump wins. Certain emerging market asset classes would also move sharply. The Mexican peso would depreciate by between 10 and 22% in case of a Trump win and its sovereign spreads rise by between 80 and 120bps. Asian traders will be in the firing line first - their markets will open as the early results come in. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll launch a new liveblog tracking the markets in a few hours. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m off to nervously watch the results have a nap, and will be back early tomorrow. In the meantime, stay tuned to our main US elections liveblog. Goodnight! GW DING DING! The closing bell of Wall Street has been rung, as traders pushed shares higher for the second day running. In a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-on mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Dow Jones industrial average has ended the day 72 points higher at 18,331, up 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 shows similar gains, as traders continue to bet on a Clinton victory tonight. And the Mexican peso is still trading at a two-month high, in a clear sign that traders expect Donald Trump to fail in his bid to reach the Oval Office. With fifteen minutes until trading ends in New York, the Dow is holding onto its gains. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 104 points, or 0.5%, as investors continue to anticipate a Clinton victory. Could they be too complacent? This has not been the most dramatic day in the stock markets, in truth. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all going to change in a few hours, once the results come in. Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co, says traders should buckle up. He told Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put your seat belts on because this is going to be a bumpy ride... As the polls close later today, investors will be moving in a chaotic fashion to get ahead of the information flow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Asia and Australia, traders are heading to their desks to watch the US election results unfold. IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Weston says the market still feel that Hillary Clinton has the edge. But memories of the Brexit referendum this summer haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t faded. He reminds us how events unfolded in June: As soon as Newcastle and Sunderland broke and the markets thought \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to happen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, then the sky darkened and the markets caved in. This election isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market could be wild. Of course, we mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that there is a real battle for the Senate too and its 50/50 that the Republicans can hold onto the Upper Chamber. The Mexican peso is continuing to rally, and just hit a new two-month high: Almost all of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average are up today, but the gains are fairly muted. Consumer good group Procter and Gamble, fast food chain McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and drinks group Coca-Cola are among the top risers: Less than one hour to go until trading closes on Wall Street, folks! And the New York stock market is still on track to finish higher tonight, as investors continue to predict a victory for Hillary Clinton. The rally has weakened a little, though, as investors show some caution about the election: Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were dramatically oversold. People were nervous Trump would win. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be additional volatility in both directions between now and the end of the day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There were lots of nervous faces on Wall Street today, as traders kept one eye on the markets and the other one on the unfolding election. Here are some new pictures from the NYSE trading floor: Jeremy Cook of World First is also concerned about the effect that the VoteCastr realtime polling is having on the markets.... MXN = the Mexican peso Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat graph showing how the US stock markets pushed higher today after VoteCastr said Hillary Clinton was leading in key states like Florida (even though we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how accurate its system actually is) Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Standard Life Investments, has just published a note about the implications of a Trump or Clinton victory. If Hillary takes the White House the Lawson says the status quo will be maintained. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be gridlock in Washington but the economy will maintain its slow but steady recovery, and the Federal Reserve could hike borrowing costs next month. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 In this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstatus quo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outcome the combination of a healthier economy and reduced policy uncertainty should allow the Fed to recommence normalising interest rates at its December meeting, though the pace of rate increases will remain gradual.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But if Trump wins... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election would introduce more uncertainty to the outlook for government policy, economic activity and the Fed, though those risks are not all to the downside. Initially, considerable market volatility is possible but it is actual policy decisions that will dictate the trajectory for the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lawson is betting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough trade talk is largely hot air and if he cuts regulation on the finance, energy, telecoms and healthcare sectors, that could boost earnings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If, on the other hand, a President Trump turns out to be serious about pursuing a much more protectionist policy agenda, the negative consequences for economic activity and corporate margins could easily offset the benefits of fiscal easing, preventing the Fed from tightening policy for some time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that the live voting data produced by VoteCastr is affecting stock prices. The WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Vigna explains: Wall Street traders are moving markets Tuesday based on a small group of websites that purport to offer real-time estimates of the election results. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a first for traders, and for the news media. It has been a longstanding policy for mainstream media to not report on exit-polling data while polls are still open on Election Day, so as to avoid discouraging voters in western states from voting. Today, though, websites Vice and Slate plan on providing what they are characterizing as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd voting projections throughout the day. To be sure, this is an experiment, and a controversial one. Regardless, the numbers are being put out there, and the market is noticing. With the Slate data showing Hillary Clinton leading in several key swing states, stocks have shot higher and bonds have fallen. Right now, VoteCastr are giving Clinton a four point lead in the crucial state of Florida, with 48% of support vs Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 44%. If the Democrats do claim Florida, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see a Republican victory. BUT (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big one), realtime polling forecasts are still somewhat experimental. If early voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t representative of the electorate, then their projections could be skewed, for example. The Mexican peso has hit a two-month high today, which also suggests investors are predicting defeat for Donald Trump. The peso has rallied to 18.4195 against the US dollar, from 18.58/$1 last night, a gain of 1% or so. The peso has been very sensitive to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electoral prospects, given his attacks on Mexicans and opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Another handy map showing when the polls close across America (add five hours for UK timing): The VIX \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has fallen by 4.5% today, in another sign that US investors are looking forward to the end of the election (and who can blame them?) The US stock market is creeping higher and higher in mid-afternoon trading, as investors cautiously anticipate that Hillary Clinton will celebrate victory tonight/tomorrow. The Dow Jones industrial average is now up 124 points, or 0.67%, at 18,382. The S&amp;P 500, the broader measure of the US stock market, has gained 0.5%. According to CNBC, the Dow is on track for its best two-day rally since the Brexit vote (it jumped by 371 points yesterday). The news that Guam voters have (symbolically) backed Clinton is one factor. Another factor is that analytics company VoteCastr says Clinton has the edge in some key swing stages, including Florida. But they also caution that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days, with plenty of votes still to be cast. A reason for caution about trying to predict the outcome of all this. Dominic Rushe writes: If you want to know why investors are nervous, look at Ohio. President Barack Obama won the state in both 2008 and 2012 but the polls are giving Trump the edge this year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of a number of formerly Democrat leaning states where many blue collar voters feel left behind by Democrats. I was in Youngstown, Ohio last week talking to business leaders and they are deeply unhappy with Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy and worried that Clinton will just be more of the same. They blame trade policies for the collapse of industry; this used to be steel country. And Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green fuel initiatives for the collapse of the coal industry. Unemployment in Youngstown is 6%, a full percentage point above the national average, and rising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d vote for Donald Duck before I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d vote for her,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bill Strimbu, president of local trucking firm Nick Strimbu, told me. There is nervousness among investors as the US votes for its next president - the spectre of the Brexit vote and the complete inaccuracy of the polls there is still fresh in the memory - but European markets have managed to end in positive territory. The news from Guam, a positive sign for Hillary Clinton, has given US markets a lift and helped push Europe higher too. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 36.23 points or 0.53% at 6843.13 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was up 0.24% at 10,482.32 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.35% at 4476.89 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.48% to 16,817.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 8937.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.28% to 582.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 118 points or 0.65%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a traders guide from Goldman Sachs to what is likely to happen when as the election results come in, courtesy MarketWatch: An early positive sign for Hillary Clinton - she has been backed in the tiny US island of Guam: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after drifting lower in early trading, is now up 72 points or 0.4%. More on how markets would react to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump winning today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said: A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval. For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now. In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets. We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens. Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago. This is a sign that markets are confident that Hillary Clinton will win the US Presidential election tonight. It also suggests that should she lose the election and Trump win, there could be a major readjustment in financial markets, with Fed rate hike expectations falling sharply, a dramatic fall in US bond yields, and a decline in the US dollar. ...While we think a Clinton win is more likely, we are still gearing up for major financial market volatility if this proves not to be the case. Our clients also appear fairly confident about a Clinton win, however, this is reflected more in their foreign exchange positions than in their stock market positioning. Our clients are long the US dollar in the lead up to the election result, and 75% of clients trading dollar/yen are long. The fact that our clients are willing to short the yen at this stage, suggests that they do not see a shock election result from the US. Although we expect stock markets to stage a relief rally if we see Clinton win the White House later today, we believe that any stock market rally is likely to be short-lived, as markets instead focus on the risk of rising bond yields and a Fed rate hike in a few weeks, which could be bad news for stocks into the end of the year. Away from the US election for a moment, and more signs of a slowing UK economy. The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of October, compared to growth of 0.5% in the three months to September. The think tank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oriol Carreras said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our estimates suggest the economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the three months to October. Robust consumer spending growth continues to support the economy. Looking ahead, this contribution from consumers is expected to wane over the course of next year due to a substantial rise in the rate of inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Its latest quarterly forecast published earlier this month predicted GDP growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. US markets have lost a bit of steam since yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euphoric rise on the news that the FBI would not re-open its inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails. The Dow Jones ended yesterday up 2%, the S&amp;P 2.22% and the Nasdaq 2.37% as Clinton inched further ahead of Trump in the polls. As the bell rung on election day all the stock market indices are down a fraction of a percent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a long, nail-biting day on Wall Street. Separately...a former advisor to two former Republican president tweets: Ding ding! The Wall Street opening bell is ringing, to start the election day trading session. The main indices are dipping around 0.2%in early trading. More in a moment.... You can get ready for tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election drama with the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsurvival guide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,. It lays out when the key action should happen (complete with food and drink recommendations) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also laid out five potential scenarios for the election, including how Donald Trump could be swept to the White House. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also analysed the latest opinion polls, including for crunch states such as Florida: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders are acting like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dczombies today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He flags up that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone week volatility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the US dollar-euro exchange rate has fallen sharply, since the FBI absolved Hillary Clinton of misconduct over her email server on Sunday night. However.... this could change very much tomorrow if we do not get the expected outcome which is always a chief concern. Aslam also predicts that Wall Street would plunge sharply if Trump beats Clinton. If Trump wins the election, we are expecting the S&amp;P500 to drop nearly 6.16 percent% and the picture will be even more vile for the emerging markets. Traders have roused themselves from their US election torpor to drive shares in Marks &amp; Spencer down by 4.3%. M&amp;S are languishing at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, as the City shows little enthusiasm for its latest turnaround plan. Steve Rowe the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO, has torn up M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international ambitions, and will shut 53 overseas stores from China to Lithuania. Rowe is also canning the clothing departments at 60 stores, as part of a new focus on food. Given the lack of news, City traders could easily have taken today off. And looking at the stock market right now, maybe they already have! The blue-chip Footsie index is barely changed this morning, and sterling has dipped a little. FTSE 100: up 0.4 points or 0.01% at 6807 The pound: down 0.15% at $1.2381 It could be the calm before the hurricane, though. Trading floors will be pretty lively places tomorrow morning, especially if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shock result. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The danger here of a Brexit-like shock is overblown; voter behaviour for one-off referendums is not comparable to that of routine elections. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, if Trump is named the 45th President of the United States, then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certain to be traders running across the floor throwing papers in the air. An initial overreaction, comparable to the UK Brexit experience to-date, is likely before markets settle again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Betfair has seen a late flurry of wagers on Hillary Clinton who currently has a 78% chance of victory at its site. Barry Orr, Spokesperson for Betfair, says that 80% of presidential bets yesterday were on the Democratic candidate. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been around \u00c2\u00a37m traded in the last 24 hours and with so much money coming into the market the odds are likely to continue to fluctuate throughout the day and into the night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With nearly \u00c2\u00a3118m now traded it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surpass the \u00c2\u00a3127m betting market record set by Brexit in June. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely the market will trade anywhere near as much as Brexit did once polls were closed, which occasionally hit \u00c2\u00a310k per second, but if it does we would easily be looking at more than \u00c2\u00a3150m total traded on the market. Many City traders are preparing for a sleepless night, to help deal with a rush of action once polling results come in. ETX Capital, for example, will be fully staffed overnight, and expects to face plenty of volatility. Analyst Neil Wilson explains: Market action could hinge on one or two moments - for example the Florida result, key for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances for the presidency, is vitally important. This will create some big opportunities in some of the most exposed markets, particularly around some of the key currency pairs, stocks and gold. But a word of warning - there could be some wild gyrations in prices, making this potentially the most turbulent trading sessions since Brexit. Looking to the results, if key states start to lean towards Trump, we may see sizeable risk-off selling as investors flee to havens like the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and gold. US government bond yields could sink and gold would soar. Turbulence could come quickly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c polls in the vital swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina close between 7pm and 8pm (EST), which is midnight-1am GMT. You can expect markets to be highly sensitive to the results from these states. If they are called for either side early we will have a very clear idea about where the markets are headed. And if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough action, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the England vs India test match! New York traders are heading to Wall Street for what is bound to be an edgy session. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.2% surge, the Dow is expected to dip ever-so slightly at the open. The markers may remain dull until late tonight, when the first exit polls arrive. The first polls close at 6pm ET, or 11pm in the UK, followed by a flurry over the next couple of hours: Asian financial markets will be open, of course, and could see the brunt of the early buying/selling as the winner becomes clear. Despite yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief rally, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of anxiety in the markets. Barclays says that: Similar to the pre-Brexit landscape, the risk premium on European equities is already near all-time highs, suggesting that investors are somewhat braced for an adverse economic outcome. The team at RBC have produced some predictions for how the markets will react to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election result: Equities S&amp;P 500 should rally 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4% upon a Clinton win and decline 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12% on a Trump victory. VIX [the volatility index] should decline to 13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14 upon a Clinton victory and rise to 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 if Trump prevails. EM Equities such as Mexico, China, and others should rally under a Clinton presidency and sell off sharply under a Trump win. Currencies and Commodities Mexican Peso has become a proxy for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of success (moves inversely); would rally under a Clinton win. Yen and other safe harbor currencies would sell off on a Clinton victory and rally if Trump prevails. Gold would slide upon a Clinton win and rise on a Trump victory. Global Rates Safe Havens (Switzerland, Japan)yields would rise modestly on a Clinton victory and fall on a Trump win. LatAm and Emerging Market yields would fall upon a Clinton win and move sharply higher on a Trump victory. They also suggest that companies who provide services through Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Affordable Care Act should rally if Clinton wins, as should firms exposed to global trade. But if Tump wins, expect gold producers to rally - along with pharmaceuticals companies (as Clinton has promised to tackle high drugs prices). Trade has been a recurring theme of the US election campaign, with Donald Trump arguing that US jobs have been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstolen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by China. That has sparked fears of a new wave of protectionism under a Trump White House. But as these graphs from Deutsche Bank show, world trade may already have hit a turning point. Paul Donovan, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global chief economist, sounds thoroughly disenchanted with the whole US election. In his daily note to clients, Donovan explains how politicians have a duty to combat the rise in prejudice against other groups (rather than fuelling it, ala Trump), and to explain how technological changes are changing the labo(u)r market. Donovan says: The two most unpopular candidates in US presidential history face each other in the elections today. Perhaps Her Britannic Majesty could be persuaded to resume control of the colonies? There is nothing constructive to be said today on the political noise, so perhaps we should look to the challenges ahead. Prejudice is one of the biggest threats to economic and social stability. Prejudice is on the rise. Declaring a group in society to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd undermines their economic contribution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c increasingly so in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changing world. Politicians must tackle prejudice head-on; it is morally and economically the right thing to do. Global trade patterns are changing. Lengthening supply chains and outsourcing are outdated as localized production reintroduces the imperial trade model, and technology means that trade in services is increasingly important. Politicians need to stop living the trade of the past, and embrace the trade of the future. Jobs do not disappear; jobs become different. Politicians must tell people that if a robot takes their job, they must find something else to do (and help them with that). Technology does not cause deflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c technology changes relative prices, not inflation. Politicians challenging central bank independence at a time of quantitative policy is very dangerous The sovereign bond market has also entered a state of temporary hibernation this morning, with the prices of benchmark US, UK and German debt virtually unchanged. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, says few people wants to take a big risk ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the numbers are as close as this and when we are seeing an antiestablishment movement that perhaps behaves differently to traditional election voters, then the outcome is more uncertain, After three hours of trading, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are still gripped by nervous tension. The FTSE 100 is currently up just 9 points, or 0.13%, as the City awaits results from America overnight. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The reality has hit home today, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carefree exuberance almost made us believe the election was already over. Today sees all other concerns thrown out the window as we hunker down for a historic night that will likely dictate market sentiment for the remainder of this year. A handy map for those of you trying to plan your election coverage overnight (all timings for the UK) A Trump victory could send the gold price surging to $1,400 per ounce, up from around $1,280 today, according to Citi analysts. They also predict that the Mexican peso would slump by 10%, to 20 peso to the $1, on fears of trade disruption. Several City firms are warning their clients to expect a heavy selloff on Wednesday, if Donald Trump beats Hillary Clinton. Andreas Johnson, economist at Nordic bank SEB, warns that the race could be closer than people expect. A Trump victory would be a clear risk off event that would trigger significant reactions and equity markets would take a sharp hit, at least in the short term. Emerging market assets look particularly vulnerable as safe haven flows would put pressure on assets perceived to risky. A clear Clinton victory should trigger a short-lived rally. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the tightening of the polls indicate that the risk of a very close result is substantial. In this scenario the election result could be up for challenge and equity markets could suffer from a prolonged period of uncertainty. The 2000 presidential election resulted in a month of uncertainty and such a scenario could weigh heavily on stock markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam Private Wealth (UK), says Trump could disrupt global trade and rock the financial system: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Clinton win would put America in safe(r) hands, but much will depend on the individuals she appoints around her. If she does as expected and plays it safe in her choices, the markets will breathe a sigh of relief. Trump on the other hand, would be a wildcard president and one that few investors would welcome. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies would likely see a destabilised financial system and damaged international trade relationships. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all doom and gloom though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-business taxation policies may mitigate some of the damage done to the wider economy. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver predicts that the US dollar could fall by up to 10% against the pound. A 5%-10% drop in the value of the US dollar is entirely possible should Trump be elected on November 8th. In terms of the bigger picture, the global implications of this swing in the market becomes a huge issue for countries with US dollar denominated debt in the emerging market amongst others. Should we be trading at 1.2500 just prior to the election, we could be seeing a trading range between 1.3100 and 1.3500 in the instant aftermath of the result. However...there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a chance that panicky investors might pile into the US dollar in search of safety. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing that agitates Britons more than the US presidential election, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a change to their favourite chocolate. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite an outcry this morning, as people realise that Toblerone has cut the size of some of its bars, and hiked the prices too. This follows fall in the pound since the EU referendum, and frankly the redesign looks like an Photoshopped vision of post-Brexit gloom: Fans are venting their anger, with one claiming that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dumbest corporate decisions of all time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Newsflash: British industrial output fell unexpectedly in September, but manufacturing managed a small revival. The Office for National Statistics reports that industrial production shrank by 0.4%, due to a decline in mining and quarrying, and oil and gas extraction. But encouragingly, manufacturing output rose by 0.6% during the month. Senior ONS statistician Kate Davies says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t draw any sweeping conclusions about Brexit, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing was broadly flat across the third quarter while oil and gas were weak overall, with widespread summer maintenance shutdowns hampering production more than usual. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no obvious signs so far of either the weaker pound or post-referendum uncertainties affecting the output of UK factories, which continued broadly in line with recent trends.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today could be a pretty dull trading session in Europe, warns Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: The morning session could be a bit of a duff one this Tuesday, given that nothing concrete from the US in terms state-voting etc is going to be out until this evening. It is likely going to be one of those days where the seismic nature of an event renders the market inert for around 24 hours. The pound has risen 0.3% against the US dollar this morning, to $1.2424, recovering some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. But generally the currency markets are pretty calm. BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets are in lockdown mode at the moment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little tentativeness ahead of the election even though polls are giving Clinton the lead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are as flat as an American pancake in early trading (but nowhere near as delicious). The FTSE 100 index has crept up just 3 points, having jumped by 113 points yesterday. The German and French markets are equally dull, while the Italian FTSE MIB has dipped a little. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally was driven by the news that the FBI had cleared Hillary Clinton over her email server, following a second probe. Now, investors are wondering if the polling are right - they give the Democratic nominee a three point lead nationally. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says that memories of the British EU referendum are still fresh: With the finishing line now in sight financial markets are reacting as if a Clinton win is a done deal, in eerie echoes of the lead-up to the June UK Brexit vote, as markets priced in the preservation of some form of status quo, and we all know how that ended. Financial traders are pretty confident that Hillary Clinton will win, according to spread-betting firm IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential barometer. It shows that Clinton now has an 81% chance of success, based on IG clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trades: City experts are predicting a small rally if Clinton wins the presidency, and a whopping selloff if Trump triumphs. Today isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about the presidential race, of course. City investors are also watching Congressional elections, to see who wins control of Capitol Hill. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the Republicans will retain their grip on the lower house of Congress. In terms of the Senate, Republicans are currently slightly edging out Democrats 51-49 in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no toss-ups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd polling. But while the Presidency and Senate are seemingly too close to call, the House looks very likely to remain decidedly in Republican control\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey are ahead 224 to the Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 190, not including the 21 toss-ups. Thus, Republicans can achieve a majority of 218 seats without winning any of the toss-ups. That would potentially make it rather harder for Hillary Clinton to push policies through, should she beat Donald Trump tonight. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one event on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind today, of course, the US presidential elections. And global stock markets looks decidedly nervous this morning as America heads to the polls after one of the more vicious and occasionally unedifying campaigns. Last night, the US stock market posted its best one-day jump since March, with the Dow Jones index rising by 2%. But investors appears to be hunkering down today as they wait to see whether the polls are right, and Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump to the White House. European stock markets are looking becalmed right now, after a lacklustre day in Asia which saw Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei dip 5 points, or 0.03%. Investors can remember the shock of 24th June, when predictions that Britain would vote to remain in the EU came badly unstuck. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets sums up the situation: Asian markets have struggled for traction overnight, unable to build on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, with momentum fading. Memories of a surprise Brexit result are too fresh to ignore at this late stage and polls so tight. Clinton has enjoyed an early success, claiming the (tiny) constituency of Dixville Notch by four votes to two! But that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough -- the election will be decided in key battlegrounds like Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and Ohio. If Trump performs surprisingly well in those states, things could get very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinteresting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already liveblogging all the action from the US, here. Also coming up today...... High street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer has announced a store closure programme as CEO Steve Rowe tries to breath new life into the chain. A looooong-awaited report into Royal Bank of Scotland has shown how the bank mistreated some small customers, following allegations that some were deliberately driven into bankrupcy. RBS is paying \u00c2\u00a3400m compensation. European finance ministers are holding an Ecofin meeting in Brussels this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing plans to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance. Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda, but I guess it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussed in some quiet corners And on the economic front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting new industrial production figures from Germany and the UK this morning. And at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank will estimate how quickly the UK economy grew in the August-to-October quarter.",

While Trump slightly soothed some concerns in his victory speech, uncertainty remains over what kind of a US he plans to lead and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to provide the same assistance that the Bank of England did at this stage.

Are there signs of moderation in policy, particularly its most controversial aspects on foreign policy? How quickly do we find out about presidential appointments, to the post of Treasury secretary in particular, and are they credible?</p> </blockquote> <p><em>(So far Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric in his victory speech - far more presidential than expected - has served to help steady the markets, with Europe off its worst levels) </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Data.</strong> There is an unambiguous rise in policy uncertainty and the key question is how much does this impact near-term US and global growth. Both the Fed and the markets will be closely scrutinizing upcoming releases, but we will have to wait until the week of November 21st for the first business confidence surveys (Markit PMI). </p> <p><strong>Chair Yellen.</strong> It is reasonable to assume that the Fed may put December rate hike preparations on hold until more clarity is reached on the data, but even more importantly the market will be looking for confirmation that Chair Yellen will not resign. Trump has been particularly critical of her term so policy continuity will be particularly important. </p> </blockquote> <p>As far as the dollar goes, Saravelos says there is a tension at work: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a clear tension between the negative impact of lower Fed expectations, higher uncertainty and risk premium on US assets compared to the positive implications of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and corporate tax programs on growth and corporate tax repatriation. We view the impact as unambiguously negative for emerging market currencies against the dollar. Risk-aversion near-term but prospects of higher US yields medium-term both work against EM. The big rise in EM inflows over recent months paints a worrying backdrop. For developed market currencies the tension between lower Fed expectations near-term but a more positive fiscal story medium-term is balanced enough to keep our forecasts and medium-term dollar bullish outlook unchanged. The one exception to our dollar positive forecasts is dollar/yen where we view both the Asian geopolitical and risk-aversion impact as sufficiently strong to re-enforce our conviction on our year-end target of 94.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5822d94ce4b0822c310ec444\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T08:18:45.439Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump victory speech reassures investors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live\">Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech</a> has helped sentiment in the City.</strong></p> <p>His pledge to serve all the American people, rebuild the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure, double the growth rate and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do a great job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have all brought some calm to the markets after a very volatile night.</p> <p>The dollar has started to strengthen and the pound has given back all its gains against the US currency.<br></p> <p>Why?

And the odds of the central bank increasing interest rates in December have lengthened. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The FTSE 100 fell 2% upon opening on Wednesday, before recovering to end the day more than 60 points up. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Japanese Nikkei 225 closed down 5.4% and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng fell 2.2%. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrapping up for the day, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow (or tonight if things get dicey). The former chairman and CEO of General Electric said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the opportunities are unlimited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd under a Trump presidency. You look at lower taxes. You look at job creation. We are stuck. We have been stuck in a terrible, overregulated economy for eight years. I mean stuck. Business stinks. Welch, a longtime Republican, told CNBC that he liked Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from the first day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he is still concerned about the messenger. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every time I lurched forward in support, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d lose the messenger. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do some wacky thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. He said he hoped Trump would build a broad coalition of Republican talent in the White House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have grudges in this game. You need talent. We will win with the best people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Welch withdrew his support for Trump, following the revelations that the president-elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was famous. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott says Americans have gambled on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise that he can shift the the US out of its post-financial crisis torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit. Although Trump campaigned as an outsider, his policies have been tried before. Ronald Reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the Pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Tax breaks for the rich and military Keynesianism sent the deficit rocketing. For the time being, all Wall Street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why share prices have been going up. You can read Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole piece here. Trump will have to temper his global antagonism, economists say Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic, too much says Berenberg bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Mickey Levy in a note to clients: Trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that understand and influence the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approaches on international affairs. This will serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign. Levy said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with Mexico and tear up global trade agreements \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will fade, with no material follow through or implementation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no wall will be built between Mexico and the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. China and Mexico are two of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trading partners. Neither wants to enter a trade war with the US, and neither can afford to do so. The US relies heavily on imports from those partners. Current concerns about major trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic. Luca Paolini, chief strategist Pictet Asset Management, declared Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no friend of trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warned that his protectionist streak poses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perhaps the biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His proposals to raise trade tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pledging, among other things, to levy a 45 per cent tax on Chinese imports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are a worry. His denouncement of China as a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. At a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a structural decline, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance casts a shadow over the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. BofA Merrill Lynch downgrades US 2017 growth The bank has cut its forecasts for US GDP growth by 0.5% percentage points in both the first and second quarter of 2017, and warned of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153despair in the financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It said: Near-term drag: Shaved 0.5pp from first and second quarter GDP growth, thereby lowering the annual number from 2.1% to 1.8%. A more cautious Fed: We expect 1 rather than 3 Fed rate hikes between now and the end of next year with the probability of a December hike falling to 1-in-3. Given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this stage, we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting impacts on growth in the medium term. While a wide range of outcomes is possible, the risks to the economy seem to be skewed more to the downside. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisers have accused Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, of creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153false economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by keeping interest rates artificially low to help President Obama and his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump has attacked Yellen throughout his campaign. In September he said Yellen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be ashamed of herself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I used to hope that the Fed was independent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in an interview with CNBC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the Fed is obviously not independent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously not even close to being independent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just hours after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, Judy Shelton, his only female economist adviser, told the FT that Trump wanted to a new chair of the Fed. She said: He has made it a very strong point of his campaign that he thinks that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention and elongated accommodative monetary policy has created a false economy. People who have worked all their lives have been penalised by these low rates. Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast enough. The market expected the Fed to raise rates in December, but Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has - ironically - made a rate rise much less likely. On Tuesday afternoon, when it looked like Clinton was odds-on to secure the White House the probability of a December rate hike was 81%, according to CME Group. Now it is 67%. Trump has repeatedly said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed chief when her term expires in early 2018. He wants to replace her with a Republican who follows his economic thinking. The Fed increased the benchmark federal funds rate to between 0.25-0.5% in December 2015, and has held there since due to various national and global uncertainties. Dominic Rushe, US business editor, has been speaking to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BNP Private Bank. Ablin was as surprised as many by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory and by the sanguine reaction of the US markets. I expected that at the least the markets would give up all the gains that they had made when it looked like Clinton was going to win. That said it is encouraging that people are seeing opportunities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But Ablin believes that there are likely to be issues ahead. Among today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big gainers are pharmaceutical companies. Investors now believe will escape the price caps Clinton had proposed and benefit from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to cut regulation. But those companies do the majority of their business overseas. Trump has suggested building a wall around our borders and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude on trade could build a figurative wall around US business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ablin believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calm is unlikely to last and that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inexperience in foreign policy, and his comments on trade, are likely to cause volatility in the weeks and years ahead. Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man, telecoms magnate Carlos Slim, is not quite as rich today. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5th richest man, who is also a big donor to the Clinton Foundation and major New York Times shareholder, has lost $5.1bn in wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory according to Bloomberg. Slim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal fortune fell by as much as 9.2% as the Mexican peso plunged by 13% before stabilizing at 8% down. The nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor and finance minister were forced to reassure the nation that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances are safe. The top 10 Mexican billionaires on the Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index lost a combined $6.5bn. Overall, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest people lost $41bn. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has emailed all his employees, calling on business leaders and government officials to listen to the disenfranchised working class voters who helped deliver Trump the election. He said they showed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep desire for change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here is the full text of his memo (highlights, ours): Dear colleagues, We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices. We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges. Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all. America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy. J.P. Morgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that will continue to thrive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as we continue to focus on helping to serve our clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges throughout the world. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future and the role our company will continue to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together. Jamie This is Rupert Neate, in the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York office, taking over from Graeme. As Wall Street pulls off a surprising surge despite 370 prominent economists warning that a Trump presidency would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous, destructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the national and the world economy, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a look at who the biggest financial winners are. Private prison operator Corrections of America surged by as much as 60% in early trading before settling back at a 41% increase. Rival operator GEO Group was also up 18%. The companies are soaring as analysts reckon that Trump will row back on the Department of Justice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling this summer to phase out privately run jails. The companies could benefit still further from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for the mass deportation of immigrants. Analysts at Height Securities said: Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump, as his administration will likely rescind the DOJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contract phase-out and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come under further stress. Oil companies are benefiting from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to make America \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energy independent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, tear up red tape and allow oil and gas exploration in new areas. He has also vowed withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and wants to end the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153billions and billion and billions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd given to UN climate programmes and clean energy development. Big pharma companies are also gaining, as Hillary Clinton had pledged to bring in controls to prevent pharmaceutical companies from hiking the price of drugs following recent scandals. Shares in Pfizer, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest drug company, are up 7%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never much room for sentiment in the financial markets. And over on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index had hit its highest level in a month - just as Hillary Clinton was giving her first speech since the election. The index has now gained 1% since trading opened, touching levels last seen in early October. The Dow Jones index has also popped higher. Clinton called for Democrats to accept the result, saying they should give Trump an open mind and the chance to lead. Our main US election liveblog has the details: After a wild day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, European stock markets have ended the day with solid gains. In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares closed 1% higher at 6911.8. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a turnaround, given the index plunged by 2% at the start of the trading day (just as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory was confirmed). Wall Street is betting that the prospect of reforming America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gun laws faded last night, sending shares of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest gun companies sliding by 10% today. Sam Thielman reports: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election effectively puts an end to the gun control legislation proposed by Democrats. Under Barack Obama, gun companies have enjoyed record breaking sales and share price growth driven by fears that he would tighten rules on sales following a series of mass shootings. Smith &amp; Wesson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were down 10.21% and shares of Sturm Ruger were down 12.29% in early morning trading. US stocks are moving higher, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 100 points, or 0.5%. So much for the Trump slump.... Pharmaceuticals companies, infrastructure providers and banking stocks are leading the way (for reasons explained earlier). Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says investors have digested the election result with impressive speed. But the long-term implications of the result simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t known yet. The narrative seems to be that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential promises during his victory speech have reassured investors, allowing for the remarkable recovery seen this afternoon. The market may also be correcting the intensely negative gut reaction it had to the result, much as it did in the aftermath of the Brexit. Simply it is too early to tell what exactly President Trump has in store, something that may make for a rocky rest of November, even if today has confounded expectations market-wise. The US dollar has now risen since Wall Street opened, reversing its overnight losses. Some analysts are arguing that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out a hike in US interest rates in December. And if he does cut taxes, boost infrastructure spending and impose trade curbs, then inflation would rise and the Fed might raise borrowing costs faster than currently anticipated in 2017 and 2018. That makes the dollar a more attractive asset. Capital Economics also predict that Trump might be less extreme than anticipated: David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, has predicted that Donald Trump could be less aggressive and more pragmatic than he promised during the campaign He told investors on a conference call that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The hallmark of a Donald Trump presidency will be a certain amount of pragmatism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kelly was sceptical that Trump would immediately pull out of trade agreements without knowing what to put in their place. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The danger of triggering a recession right at the beginning of your presidency is pretty high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the economy effectively at full employment, Trump might even increase immigration of desperately needed skilled workers, Kelly said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after all the property tycoon used many immigrants himself to build his hotels in Florida. A couple of photos from Wall Street: Credit rating agency Fitch has warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut taxes would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditworthiness in the medium-term. In a new report, they say: Tax cuts would increase household disposable income, which could boost short-term growth when coupled with deregulation and higher public investment. But this would depend on how far such measures are offset by potential negative factors such as a hit to private investment from policy uncertainty, financial market developments (for example a rising dollar and falling equities), and adverse trade effects. Fitch also warn that US growth would suffer, and prices would rise, if Trump pulled America out of NAFTA and imposed new tariffs on imports from China. However, Fitch have no immediate plans to downgrade America from its current gold-plated rating of AAA/Stable, thanks to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unique strengths\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (such as a reserve currency, and the ability to print as many US dollars as it ever needs) Shares in Smith &amp; Wesson, the firearms maker, have tumbled by 10% today: It looks like Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory is is good news for someone: private prisons. After 45 minutes of trading, Wall Street remains remarkably calm. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation: Dow Jones: up 21 points at 18,355, +0.1% S&amp;P 500: up 2 points at 2,141, + 0.1% Nasdaq: down 16 points at 4,780, -0.5%. Healthcare firms are plunging this morning as Wall Street investors anticipate big changes to Obamacare. Insurance group Centene Corporation is down 16%, the worst-performing stock on the S&amp;P 500. Private healthcare providers are also falling; Hospital Corporation of America has shed 14% while Universal Health Service has lost 8%. Donald Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the Republican majority in Congress could make this possible. John McDonough, a Harvard University professor, has already warned Vox that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have a death blow to the Obamacare health coverage expansion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pharmaceutical firms are also propping up the S&amp;P 500, which is down just 0.4% in early trading. Drugs firm Pfizer has leapt by 9.8%, with rival Merck not far behind (+6%) And machinery maker Caterpillar has jumped by 8%, as investors anticipate Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new infrastructure plan. Shares in biotech companies are rocketing. Hillary Clinton had pledged to fight price-gouging by biotech firms, a pledge that sent shares sliding back in August. Ding Ding! Wall Street is open for trading.... And the Dow Jones index actually ROSE by 70 points, before dipping back. Share in steel producers, defence firms and pharmaceuticals firms are leading the rally. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because traders are anticipating a surge in infrastructure projects, military spending, and less pressure on drugs prices. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable turnaround compared to nine hours ago, when the Dow was tipped to plunge by 800 points. But it will take a while for the market to calm down.... The future direction of global stock markets depends on how Donald Trump now behaves. Traders are caught in two minds right now -- between whether to welcome the promise of new infrastructure spending to drive US growth (a buy signal) or to fear a new outbreak of protectionism and trade wars (a cue to sell). Mohamed El-Erien, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, just discussed this conundrum on Bloomberg TV. El-Erien says that if we get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very gracious Trump, very unifying Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of his victory speech, then equity market will be calm and government bond yields will go higher (in anticipation of more borrowing and inflation). But if we get the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-trade rhetoric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the campaign, then shares will fall. El-Erien concludes that: A lot depends on what happens in the next few days, and what Mr Trump signals. Time for another quick recap, before Wall Street opens at 9.30am Eastern time (2.30pm GMT) The US stock market is expected to drop by over 1% following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory In volatile trading, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has recovered from its early selloff and is now slightly higher The US dollar has recouped its overnight losses, and just hit a one-week high against the euro The Mexican peso has plumbed record lows, and is now down 10% today at 20.22 peso to the dollar After wild swings, the yield (interest rate) on US Treasury bills is up. Traders anticipate higher US inflation and debt-fuelled infrastructure spending Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on how Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory is the latest revolt against globalisation....and how French far-right politician Marine Le Pen could be the next beneficiary: Until last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock results came in, Wall Street was quite confident that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December. But today, PNC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Stuart Hoffman is betting the Fed will hold off on a rate rise now. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be too much uncertainty in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are many open questions about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies, but they are likely to be very different from the basic bipartisan consensus that was guided U.S. policy since World War II. Trump has been very skeptical of U.S. trade pacts, and has called for severe restrictions on immigration. He also called for large cuts in personal income tax rates for wealthy Americans, a large infrastructure program, a reduction in regulations, and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With much greater economic uncertainty likely in the months ahead, the Federal Open Market Committee could decide to hold off on an increase in the fed funds rate; PNC had been expecting the FOMC to raise the rate at its December 13-14 meeting, but that looks much less likely now. However, some market indicators suggest the Fed could still hike next month. But with so much uncertainty, this could change fast.... After a dramatic night, and probably too little sleep, US traders are returning to Wall Street to face a new world. The New York stock market is expected to fall when trading begins in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. But fears of a market crash have receded. Right now, the futures market is calling the Dow Jones industrial average down 288 points, or around 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkably small reaction to one of the biggest electoral shocks in decades. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech is being credited with calming the world financial markets. It has given some breathing space for investors to consider what the Republican party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory means Kathleen Brooks of trading firm City Index says market reaction is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively muted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Equity markets are generally lower, however, losses are not of such a magnitude that they suggest market panic, in contrast, the markets appear to be sanguine about a Trump Presidency, which dramatically increases global economic uncertainty. Perhaps Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory tone in his victory speech has eased concerns about his Presidency, or perhaps markets have no idea how to price in his victory as we have no precedent for someone like Trump. Either way, a mere 24 hours ago no one would have predicted such a calm market reaction on the back of this result. The pre-market trading shows that pharmaceuticals firms are going to jump - as Hillary Clinton will not be in a position to push through her promised clampdown on drugs prices. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for consumers, but good for shareholders. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat is also bad news for renewable energy firms; their shares are down in pre-trading. Hopes of a new push on clean energy have been dented by the Democrats defeat. This chart shows the stunning move in US Treasury bills (American government debt) overnight: There was an initial surge of money into 10-year Treasuries as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory became clear around midnight Eastern time, as investors looked for a safe haven. That pushed down the yield on the bonds towards 1.7%. But that move swiftly reversed after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech, as the markets anticipated a jump in borrowing and higher inflation. They dumped Treasuries, pushing yields higher. Defence company shares are continuing to rally, sending BAE Systems up to a new record high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors are expecting governments to spend more on weaponry such as military jets and armoured vehicles, now Trump is heading to the White House. The WSJ has two theories for the spike: If Europe can no longer count on American military support to contain simmering problems on the Russian borderlands and in the Middle East, it will have to increase its own spending. Or in a more benign scenario, Mr. Trump succeeds where others have failed, by holding more NATO members to commitments to spend 2% of output on defence. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets dashboard shows how Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory has moved the markets. Stock markets (column 1) and emerging market currencies (column 2) are down, while the cost of insuring government bonds using a credit-default swap (column 4) has jumped. But commodity prices are up (column 5), thanks to the weaker US dollar and the prospect of higher infrastructure spending. There was an early rush into gold today, as panicky investors looked for a safe place for their money. That rally has unwound a little, but bullion is still up 2% at $1,301 per ounce. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com (a gold trading site) says it was the busiest day since the Brexit vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Trump proves to be the belligerent, high-spending protectionist that America just voted for, the underlying move in world gold prices looks set to keep rising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Government bond prices have dropped today, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on longer-term debts issued by the US and UK governments. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a major selloff, but it indicates that the markets are anticipating a surge of borrowing under Trump (to fund that infrastructure plan) and higher inflation too. Jonathan Platt, head of fixed income at Royal London Asset Management, sa \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main implications of this election are likely to be higher inflation as a result of fiscal policies such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. In the medium term this will raise US and global interest rates, but there may be a short term hit to consumer and business confidence. However, a comparison with Brexit would suggest that this could be overstated. Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, also spies higher inflation and government borrowing. Medium term, Trump will be reflationary, with tax reform likely to encourage corporates to repatriate cash held overseas, infrastructure spending and no great concern about higher deficits short term. Against a background of pretty full employment and wage growth of 2.8%, announced last week, this should spell higher interest rates and bond yields over time. The lessons of the Brexit vote were not learned, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange specialist Oanda: Markets have pared their earlier moves following the substantial knee jerk reaction to Trump securing an unlikely victory over rival Hillary Clinton. While the result was unexpected, the reaction in the markets stems once again from them being poorly positioned heading into the vote, overconfident that Clinton would ease to victory despite only having a narrow lead in the polls and being embroiled in an FBI investigation days before. The greatest oversight was the significance of the anti-establishment feeling in the US, similar to that which prompted the UK to quit the EU in June. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear no lessons were learned from the Brexit vote on June 23... The question now is how long will all of this last. Markets generally rebounded quite well after Brexit but this was aided by the rapid response of the central bank and the UK quickly getting its political house in order, providing reassurance for investors. While Trump slightly soothed some concerns in his victory speech, uncertainty remains over what kind of a US he plans to lead and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to provide the same assistance that the Bank of England did at this stage. It will be very interesting to see whether they still intend to raise interest rates next month, as they have alluded to recently. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory could herald the end both of globalization and the liberal economic consensus that has reigned in Western governments for decades, says Christopher Mahon, Director of Asset Allocation Research at Barings In achieving victory, Trump has defied the political class, pundits and markets alike. Rightly or wrongly, his chosen narrative has been simple \u00e2\u20ac\u201d globalization is the cause, inequality is the effect. It is a theme that we saw first in the riots and referendums in Greece, which then found firmer footing in Brexit, and has now reached its climax in America. Mahon adds that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to trade is the immediate threat: His most well-known campaign rhetoric involves building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, increasing deportations and tearing up NAFTA. Outside of North America, a tougher stance on China via the introduction of tariffs and duties could significantly impact emerging markets. Trade deals with the EU and Japan may also be at risk. And in the medium term, Barings are expecting Trump to slash taxes, both for companies and wealthy Americans, and deliver the infrastructure spending programme he promised in his victory speech - probably funded by more borrowing. European stock markets are dipping deeper into the red, although they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still someway off their opening lows. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is one of the worst performers, down almost 2.4%. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory is fuelling predictions that the Italian public could reject constitutional reforms in a referendum scheduled for early December. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escape from the shadow of Brexit today. Over in Brussels, the EC has predicted that UK growth will almost halve next year, to just 1%, due to uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union. Derry Pickford, co-head of asset allocation at City firm Ashburton Investments, predicts that Donald Trump will face big clashes with Congress, even though the Republicans will control both the lower house and the Senate. He says: Given that Trump will nominate the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, this should give the Republicans a huge amount of policy freedom. Trump is likely to face resistance from his own party and is unlikely to get cooperation from the Democrats after a bitter and acrimonious election. He also predicts that European politics could see Trump-style revolts: There is an Italian referendum on constitutional change, a French Presidential election and a Federal election in Germany scheduled within the next 12 months. An anti-establishment vote, despite what opinion polls say beforehand, should not surprise markets although we believe such victories are still likely to create market volatility given the uncertainty it will create for the policy environment. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thought: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still expecting Wall Street to take a dive when trading begins in three hours. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to drop by over 374 points, or around 2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would be a more muted reaction than we expected six hours ago, when the US election results were rolling in. At one stage the Dow was expected to plunge by 800 points: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory is boosting shares in three sectors - mining companies, pharmaceuticals groups, and defence firms. So in London, drugs makers Hikma and Shire are both up by over 7%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to deliver on Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to rein in medical prices. BAE Systems (which makes everything from cyber-security systems to warships) is up 3.3%. That suggests that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering a mood of heightened geopolitical tensions, and that European countries may not feel they can rely on NATO as much. And the weaker dollar is helping to push up commodity prices, which is good news for copper producer Antofagasta (up 3.5%) as well as Randgold (6.4%) and Fresnillo (+8.6%). Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and CEO of advertising giant WPP, tells us that the Trump election is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153effectively a second Brexit that leaves many very surprised, including the markets and me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sorrell says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take a significant amount of time to assess the implications beyond the short term. Increased levels of uncertainty will mean more hesitation to make important decisions in the short term, both by people and governments. But it may accelerate implementation of helpful reforms in the medium term to reduce uncertainty and stimulate investment as a result. Clearly immigration, trade and terrorism were key issues that swayed electoral opinion in a very significant way, just as they did in the UK, and probably will in the European referenda and elections to come. There will now be a lot of reassessment, including of polling techniques. Electorates at times like these clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to be told how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to vote, especially by the media and other elites. One unsurprising event - Baby Sorrell was born on Election Day in New York. A welcome to a rollercoaster world. More on the recovery in European markets after the initial shock. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Equity markets are negative, but nowhere near as much as you might expect, as investors digest news of a Trump Presidency. A FTSE 100 close to break even, having rallied 300 points from its overnight lows, and a DAX and DOW nursing what can only be described as minor losses in comparison to all those apocalyptic forecasts, looks a decent outcome. If anything, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened bears eerily similar hallmarks to Brexit; complacency, surprise and panic followed by swift recovery. If anything it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened more quickly this time. Could Trump prove less controversial now all those populist votes have been won? Are there enough positives including an absence of congressional deadlock to help markets back towards their highs? Time for another recap, after a wild day in the markets (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even lunchtime in the City yet!). World financial markets have swung wildly today after Donald Trump stunned the world and beat Hillary Clinton to the White House. Asian shares slumped overnight as it became clear that the Republican challenger had pulled of a sensational victory - and one that raises fears of global instability. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei led the rout, dropping by 5% in a panicky selloff that fuelled fears of a repeat of a Brexit-style rout. But the situation is looking calmer in Europe right now. After a knee-jerk slide, the FTSE 100 index has recovered its losses and is trading flat. The US dollar has also scrambled back from an early-morning rout, and is now only slightly lower against the euro. Investors appear to be taking some comfort from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech. Trump made some conciliatory comments about uniting America and governing for the whole country, after a desperately bruising and unpleasant presidential race. Laith Khalaf of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInitial stock market reaction to the Trump victory was a short intake of breath, followed by a shrug. Precious metals makers are leading the rally in London, showing that investors are expecting safe-haven assets like gold and silver to remain popular. And pharmaceuticals firms are also in demand -- the prospect of Hillary Clinton clamping down on drugs prices has just disappeared over the horizon. The Mexican Peso has born the brunt of the Trump shock - hitting a record low. Joshua Raymond of brokerage firm XTB.com says the markets expect Trump to clash with his Mexican counterparts: The relationship between the Mexico and the United States is in danger of deteriorating with Mr. Trump promising pre-election to renegotiate terms of trade and attempt to curb immigration from the southern border.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do Hillary Clinton much good, but the US economy is actually in pretty decent shape, with unemployment still low and growth rising in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason that the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t having a complete meltdown today. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, explains: Real economic growth has picked up in recent months while the unemployment rate, at 4.9%, is close to any economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definition of full employment. S&amp;P500 earnings have rebounded smartly from the oil &amp; dollar induced slump of 2015 and inflation is still moderate. Moreover, the global economy is also showing signs of life with the global manufacturing PMI index hitting a two year high in October. All of this, absent political uncertainty, would be positive for stocks and negative for bonds. Kelly also points out that Trump may struggle to push his promises through Congress, even though the Republicans have won control of Congress. It should be noted that there is a wide gulf between Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda and that of many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153establishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Republicans and the latter may well balk at unfunded tax cuts or spending increases. In addition, both the new President and Congress will likely act more slowly on dismantling the Affordable Care Act or trade agreements, until some better alternatives can be found. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to spend billions of dollars on new infrastructure is helping to calm the markets, says Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group: A few hours ago, traders feared that the US election would create a Brexit-style slump in the markets - as Asian shares suffered an almighty tonking. So far, that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happening, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a definite move out of risky assets as investors wonder what on earth happens next. The Mexican peso continues to bear the brunt of it, hitting record lows against the dollar today. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Donald Trump winning the US election a broad global risk off move is developing, although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen the kind of panic that followed the EU referendum, except in isolated instances such as the Mexico Peso Safe havens are well bid, especially the Japanese Yen alongside fixed income and gold. Risk assets, in the meantime are being destroyed with the Peso the worst loser and equity futures pointing to sharp losses for US equities. Fixed income actives are pointing to lower expectations of interest rates, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still far from clear if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election will cause the Fed to lose its nerve and hold fire on rates in December. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the election result that has shocked the world: Our live results tracker has the full story: City investors might be coming to terms with a Trump presidency, but many commentators are extremely alarmed about the implications of the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory. Our colleague Jonathan Freedland has already delivered a devastating critique of the situation: We thought the United States would step back from the abyss. We believed, and the polls led us to feel sure, that Americans would not, in the end, hand the most powerful office on earth to an unstable bigot, sexual predator and compulsive liar. People all around the world had watched and waited, through the consecutive horrors of the 2016 election campaign, believing the Trump nightmare would eventually pass. But today the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the country that had, from its birth, seen itself as a beacon that would inspire the world, a society that praised itself as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last best hope of earth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the nation that had seemed to be bending the arc of history towards justice, as Barack Obama so memorably put it on this same morning eight years ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has stepped into the abyss. Today the United States stands not as a source of inspiration to the rest of the world but as a source of fear. Instead of hailing its first female president, it seems poised to hand the awesome power of its highest office to a man who revels in his own ignorance, racism and misogyny. One who knows him well describes him as a dangerous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sociopath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And what awesome power he will soon have. Republicans did not just defy almost every projection, prediction and data-rich computer model to win the presidency. They also won the House of Representatives and much of the Senate. Trump will face few checks on his whims. A man with no control of his impulses will be unrestrained, the might of a superpower at the service of his ego and his id.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Crumbs... the FTSE 100 just erased all its early losses, and was briefly UP 2 points. Precious metals and pharmaceuticals firms continue to lead the rally, while financial stocks are still suffering from the fallout of the US election. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech: The first speech by President elect Trump has had a calming effect on the markets, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She reckons that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153definitely sounded more Presidential than he has done at any stage during the election campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (not a Herculean task, to be honest) Brooks writes: In fact, one could argue that this outsider has delivered an establishment-style victory speech, which is soothing stressed markets. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the dollar is recovering from its early slide, and European markets are suffering smaller losses than feared. Brooks adds that investors have plenty of thinking to do, having largely expected Hillary Clinton to win. Could the markets be hoping that 1, Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be as bad a President as they thought he would be less than 24 hours ago? 2, That he may actually be more establishment and less maverick than he portrayed himself throughout the campaign? At this stage we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer these questions, but they give the markets lots to ponder today. But, of course, words are cheaper than actions.... we simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what Trump will do. The yield, or interest rate, on US government debt is rising this morning after an overnight slide. That means two things. 1) The markets are getting over their initial panic about Trump 2) They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re anticipating that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll boost government borrowing, to deliver on his pledge of infrastructure spending and tax cuts. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory may not be the end of this upheaval in global politics, says Jim Leaviss, head of retail fixed interest at M&amp;G Investments: The big implication for investors of what happened last night is this: with no income growth for most populations in developed world economies since the Great Financial Crisis (with the exception of the 1%), the established parties and candidates are being heavily punished in elections. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have a referendum on the Italian constitution next month, and many more European elections in 2017 (could Marine Le Pen be elected President in France?). I saw a statistic this morning where across the G7, 65% of parents believe their children will be worse off than they are. Having seen the electoral shifts in the UK with Brexit and now the US, do established political parties react by promising significant fiscal expansions? Could last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote trigger the end of global austerity? Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UKForex, reports that the US dollar is recovering from its overnight slide, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acceptance speech: Edwards says: His appeasing tone has definitely helped. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite the reaction we were expecting, although European equity markets are all taking a hit early in trading. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors and traders are still trying to get their heads around the official result, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of trepidation out there. Spreads are wide and we still expect to see some big moves in the currency markets as the day goes on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So the pound has now shed its early gains, and back around $1.24. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to prevent some European markets suffering their biggest selloff since the Brexit shock: Volatility is absolutely rampant this morning as investors try to get to grips with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensational victory. As this chart shows, the FTSE 100 slumped by 140 points (2%) at the open, before romping back during Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down just 58 points at 6786, a drop of 0.8% It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar story in Europe, where markets fell by 4% before rebounding.... There are three key areas the markets will be looking at in the wake of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, says George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank: Trump rhetoric. Does the potential president-elect sound \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presidential\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Are there signs of moderation in policy, particularly its most controversial aspects on foreign policy? How quickly do we find out about presidential appointments, to the post of Treasury secretary in particular, and are they credible? (So far Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric in his victory speech - far more presidential than expected - has served to help steady the markets, with Europe off its worst levels) Data. There is an unambiguous rise in policy uncertainty and the key question is how much does this impact near-term US and global growth. Both the Fed and the markets will be closely scrutinizing upcoming releases, but we will have to wait until the week of November 21st for the first business confidence surveys (Markit PMI). Chair Yellen. It is reasonable to assume that the Fed may put December rate hike preparations on hold until more clarity is reached on the data, but even more importantly the market will be looking for confirmation that Chair Yellen will not resign. Trump has been particularly critical of her term so policy continuity will be particularly important. As far as the dollar goes, Saravelos says there is a tension at work: There is a clear tension between the negative impact of lower Fed expectations, higher uncertainty and risk premium on US assets compared to the positive implications of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and corporate tax programs on growth and corporate tax repatriation. We view the impact as unambiguously negative for emerging market currencies against the dollar. Risk-aversion near-term but prospects of higher US yields medium-term both work against EM. The big rise in EM inflows over recent months paints a worrying backdrop. For developed market currencies the tension between lower Fed expectations near-term but a more positive fiscal story medium-term is balanced enough to keep our forecasts and medium-term dollar bullish outlook unchanged. The one exception to our dollar positive forecasts is dollar/yen where we view both the Asian geopolitical and risk-aversion impact as sufficiently strong to re-enforce our conviction on our year-end target of 94. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech has helped sentiment in the City. His pledge to serve all the American people, rebuild the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure, double the growth rate and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do a great job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have all brought some calm to the markets after a very volatile night. The dollar has started to strengthen and the pound has given back all its gains against the US currency. Why? Jeremy Cook at World First tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because he sounded more presidential, there was no mention of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclock her up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuild a wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It was all, dare I say it, presidential\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Shares in two precious metals producers, Fresnillo and Rangold, are soaring - propping up the FTSE 100. Pharmaceutical shares however are on the rise in the FTSE 100, with Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithkline and AstraZeneca all up between 2% and nearly 5%. The sector has always been perceived as a defensive one in times of uncertainty - and this certainly counts - but more significantly, they may not face the price cuts which Hillary Clinton had promised to implement if she won. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! The London stock market has tumbled by almost 2% at the start of trading, in a heavy selloff. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Brexit-style rout, or a Black Monday-ish crash. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dropped by 141 at the open, with most shares in the red. Financial stocks are leading the selloff, with Barclays and Standard Life both losing 5%. Aviva and the Prudential have lost 4%. City investors are gathering around screens to watch Donald Trump give his victory speech, as they prepare for a messy start to trading. Trump is promising to be the president for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall Americans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and to reach out to those who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support him. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also vowing to use his business experience to help the US, and pledging a major new infrastructure spending plan to boost the economy. Trump calls it a project of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational growth and renewal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This is providing some comfort to the markets: Our main liveblog has all the action: Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive at Hermes Investment Management, says a Trump presidency will probably be bad for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term growth prospects. He writes that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign policy agenda is a particular risk: Trump might create market volatility through his pronouncements in the field of foreign policy, traditionally a preserve for presidential authority. The assumption is that Trump will listen to advice from professionals in the US State Department when dealing with foreign affairs, but on the campaign trail he demonstrated a clear willingness to dismiss professional advice, to the delight of his support base. Once again it is not a stretch to imagine Trump in talking to his home constituency might alienate the traditionally supportive Gulf nations with his Islamophobic comments. This might then strengthen Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence in the region, which could threaten regional stability and therefore the oil price. Likewise, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-NATO and pro-Vladimir Putin comments could be taken, if repeated when he is in power, as a green light by the Russian President to intensify his revanchist foreign policy in Eastern Europe. This in turn could lead to rising risk premia for European assets. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hermes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 predictions for life under Trump: Associated Press have called the election for Donald Trump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on a historic day: Donald Trump shattered expectations on Tuesday with an election night victory that revealed deep anti-establishment anger among American voters and set the world on a journey into the political unknown. The Republican nominee has achieved one of the most improbable political victories in modern US history, despite a series of controversies that would easily have destroyed other candidacies, extreme policies that have drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, a record of racist and sexist behaviour, and a lack of conventional political experience. After surprise early victories in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, it fell to the Rust Belt states of the industrial midwest to determine the result of his stunning upset.... People should try to stay calm, argues Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard Dunbar. Not the easiest challenge of the week, frankly, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do our best. Dominic Rossi, Global CIO Equities at Fidelity International, has given a very sobering assessment of the situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are heading into a world of unprecedented political risk which calls into question the pillars of the post WWII settlement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsurprising investors are heading for cover. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The immediate sense of bewilderment at the shift rightwards in American politics will need to give way to a more sober risk assessment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The immediate impact will be on the Fed. The probability of a hike in interest rates in Dec, followed by two further hikes 2017, has fallen sharply. The dollar which has been trending higher in anticipation, has consequently reversed. Both were threats to the bull market, and these have now been postponed. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, these known financial risks have been displaced by an unprecedented level of unknown political risks. We can only speculate whether Trump will follow through on his more protectionist slogans with substantive policies. Investors, particularly those overseas, will stand back and wait. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Republican control of both Houses offers an opportunity to break the political gridlock of recent years in domestic areas of policy. There will be an eagerness to roll back many Obama initiatives, above all Obamacare. A Trump victory could force central banks to end their current policy of ultra-loose monetary policy, says Derek Halpenny, European Head of Global Markets Research at MUFG. Halpenny says they may conclude that buying government debt with new money (quantitative easing, or QE) has reached the end of the road: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will no doubt be cited as another example of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disaffected voters who feel their voice is not being heard and when the dust settles, Central Bankers will in all likelihood conclude that QE and policies that slowdown government reform are part of the problem. This victory certainly will at some point start to put upward pressure on long-term yields. (That means the long-term cost of government borrowing, which is at record low levels) The latest word from America is that Hillary Clinton has not conceded defeat. Campaign chairman John Podesta has just told supporters to go home and get some sleep, while the counting continues. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UKForex, fears an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as markets digest the shock US election results: If Trump is announced president, we expect to see the dollar tank. Markets are still in denial here, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to see some very heavy dollar selling later today, through London and New York sessions. The markets reckon it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all over, reports Jill Treanor from World First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices in London: Capital Economics fears that a Trump administration will quickly undermine relations with China and Mexico. Paul Ashworth, their chief US Economist, says that the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (between the US and the EU) are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: On trade, we expect Trump to start by labelling China a currency manipulator and to bring a number of perceived disputes to the WTO. Tariffs are possible further down the line, but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the first option. He will also insist on renegotiating NAFTA, but it is hard to know what he hopes to achieve. Ashworth also fears that Janet Yellen might be forced out of the US Federal Reserve, given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated criticism: Given the adverse market reaction we have already seen, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned December rate hike is now off the table. There is a possibility that Fed Chair Janet Yellen and even some other Fed Governors (Lael Brainard??) will resign immediately. Although Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sack Yellen before her term ends in February 2018, his win demonstrates that many Americans share his view that she has been overtly political. Under those circumstances, she may feel duty-bound to step aside. Matt O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien of Wonkblog agrees: Donald Trump could be just six (!) electoral college votes away from the Oval Office, with Associated Press declaring that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won Pennsylvania. Our main US election liveblog has the details: The main European stock markets are tipped to plunge by over 4%, mirroring the impending slump in London. The 2% surge in the euro today will hurt manufacturing firms, adding to general alarm over the US election results: Rob Carnell of ING says investors simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to expect from a Trump presidency: Whilst it may be only a few hours before we hear confirmation of what we now suspect in terms of this result, it is likely to be longer still before we get more clarity on the policy intentions of Donald Trump. Aggressive protectionism is probably the greatest threat to US and global growth and financial markets, and more expansionary fiscal policy the greatest opportunity for stronger growth. Exactly what mix of these two opposing policy stances will follow may not be fully clear for months. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is likely to view the market jitters with dismay - equivalent to a financial market tightening. And the case for a December rate hike from the Fed has diminished substantially. The markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone in being wrong-footed by a Trump presidency. Political journalist James Forsyth says UK politicians are in the dark too.... European stock markets are heading for some very large falls when trading begins in two hours time, in a repeat of the June Brexit meltdown. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index is expected to tumble by over 4%, which would be its biggest slump since Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock EU referendum vote. That underlines how the City simply didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect Donald Trump to pull off a shock victory that now looks on the cards. Joshua Raymond, director at London broker XTB.com, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President Trump. This is a complete and utter shock to investors around the world and we will see European stocks sharply lower when trading opens in a few hours. We currently expect the FTSE to open 270 points lower which is a collapse of close to 4%. We have seen a major flight to safety on a similar level to the Brexit vote and the Mexican Peso has collapsed against the pound as people around the world digest the realisation that Trump is extremely likely to now become President of the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Mexican Peso is ploughing fresh record lows against the US dollar and the euro, on fears that a Trump presidency will hurt the Mexican economy hard. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 13% plunge has pushed the peso below 20 to the $1, in a wave of panic selling. This may force the Mexican authorities to hike interest rates to stabilise the currency, as traders ponder the prospects of trade disruption with America (and the possibility that Trump might actually try and build that wall) Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at Banorte-IXE: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of panic in the market, it is definitely an outcome it was not expecting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The movements are very strong, the market is showing higher risk aversion in search of safe-haven assets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asia Pacific has set the tone for what promises to be a dramatic day on the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets. A Trump presidency seems likely to bring a level of uncertainty not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But as I sign off in Sydney and handover to London, here are the main points so far: Stocks have been battered throughout Asia Pacific with the Nikkei in Japan closing down 5.36%, Australia finishing down 1.92% and Hong Kong off 2.82% (still to close there). Wall Street could see its biggest ever fall when trading opens on Wednesday with futures pointing to a 800-point drop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than 5%. The FTSE is on course to shed 250 points. One trader in London said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bigger than Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the markets The US dollar has sold off more than 3% against the Japanese yen as investors seek safe havens. Sterling and the Swiss franc were also up, as well as the euro. But the Mexican peso was a big loser \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 12.18% at 20.52. The prospect of a US rate rise has been slashed Gold has spiked almost 5% to $1,337.40 Oil has fallen 4% on the US WTI benchmark while Brent crude is down 2.43% Thanks for reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Graeme Wearden. Geoffrey Yu, Head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, fears that a Trump victory could herald more shock results in 2017, when France and Germany head to the polls. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned about Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future under a Trump presidency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lightning appears to have struck twice as Trump is set for an unexpected victory, following the shock Brexit vote earlier in the year. Pollsters, pundits and markets probably need to take stock, figure out how they got 2016 so wrong and what this portends for 2017 as the electoral calendar is also quite crowded..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the dust settles, policy and appointments will matter the most. For markets, what happens to Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be crucial. The impact of her future will be felt globally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has closed for the day (and what a day!), down 5.36% at 16,251 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slump of around 919 points. Our Australian economics commentator Stephen Koukoulas has had his say about a likely Trump win. This is the worrying point in a nutshell: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the slogan from the Trump campaign, involves the US raising barriers to international trade in an effort to protect US industry. If Trump follows through and works to restrict trade, especially with China where the US runs a huge trade deficit, there is a genuine threat that the global economy will stall, perhaps falling back into recession. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Kouk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full article: The euro has surged by over 2% against the US dollar, jumping to $1.126. If Trump is in the White House, the European single currency could become a popular safe haven with nervous investors. The Tokyo market is closing in a few minutes and is still down more than 5%. A Trump win is shaping to be a huge shock there. Our reporter in tokyo, Justin McCurry, is about to file his analysis of what it means to the region. This is his opening line: A Donald Trump presidency could pose the biggest threat to Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security ties to its two biggest allies in the Asia-Pacific \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Japan and South Korea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since the end of the second world war. And it could also have a huge impact on Japanese economy. The government of Shinzo Abe is desperate to push the value of the yen down and boost exports. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge move downwards by the US dollar is yet another blow to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abenomics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A higher yen is bad for companies, hence the big stock selloff. The US dollar has now slumped by 1% against the British pound, sending sterling up to $1.25. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly a one-month high, but still a long way below the pre-Brexit vote levels (when the pound was worth around $1.48) Correction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia has not hit its lowest point since April. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the lowest since Brexit in June. Apologies. Either way we could be looking at more rate cuts in Australia, according to CommSec chief economist Craig James, where the Aussie dollar has fallen by 1.78% to US76.12c. Before today, financial markets has only priced in a one in three chance of a rate cut in Australia by mid-2017. If financial market volatility continues and ends up affecting the broader economy, then we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out a near-term rate cut by the Reserve Bank. But he does say that there could be benefits if Trump takes the White House, the possible continued fall in oil prices and the dollar (thanks to global uncertainty) and rise in gold prices, could be good news: While sharemarkets through Asia have slumped today, a fall in the oil price, higher gold price and weaker Aussie dollar actually have served to benefit sections of the sharemarket and Corporate Australia more generally. Gold bugs would be happy with the higher gold price as would gold producers, with the latter benefitting from a weaker Aussie dollar. Many analysts are warning that a Donald Trump victory could be bad news for Janet Yellen, the first woman to run America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve. Trump criticised Yellen several times during the campaign for keeping interest rates too low (as flagged up earlier), and in May he gave a strong hint that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d replace her in 2018 when her first term expires. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says this will add to the instability in the markets, as America enters a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political thunderstorm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A man who became known for his TV catchphrase, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fired!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to fire Janet Yellen from her position will not be popular with the markets It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rough day for the ASX/S&amp;P200 index in Australia which has fallen 101.2 points, or 1.92%, to 5,156.6 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest point since April. Could be more to come? Kit Juckes, currency expert at French Bank Societe Generale, says Trump has shocked investors around the globe: Donald Trump is winning electoral college votes in key marginal states (Florida, Ohio, North Carolina) and while there is still a steep climb ahead for him to win the Presidency, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing a good impression of a cyclist overtaking all his opponents on an alpine stage of the Tour de France. Will he get the polka dot jersey and paint the electoral map red? Markets think so and are responding with the simplest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction imaginable. Gold and the yen are up. Treasury yields, equities, the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso are down. The Mexican peso has maintained its status as the bellwether of sentiment and is moving particularly sharply. The financial markets are now indicating that Wall Street could suffer its biggest ever plunge (in points terms) when Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session begins. The Dow is predicted to shed 800 points - a bigger points fall than in September 2008 when the financial crisis struck. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has now plunged by over 900 points, or 5.3%, as a wave of selling hits the Asian stock markets. The scale of the selloff shows how investors have been caught completely off guard by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success. FXTM VP of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, says the markets are suffering a repeat of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit shock: This is the exact same thing that happened during the EU referendum vote, when investors sided substantially towards pricing in a remain outcome and they were left in complete shock earlier in trading as a result of Donald Trump gaining momentum. The Dow and S&amp;P have hit their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limit down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the futures market of 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ie they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go any further into the red. The Dow is currently set to open down nearly 800 points and the FTSE100 in London is set for a 300-plus fall, according to spread better IG. They are huge falls and mirror those on Asian markets today. The Nikkei is now down 5.39%. For more on what a Trump win could mean for the US economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a recession for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c look no further than this piece from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Suzanne McGee: A Trump victory would bring on a rapid reassessment of Federal Reserve policy. Trump launched a strong attack on Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stewardship of the Fed during the debate back in September. He said that thanks to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prolonged policy of low rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when they raise interest rates, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see some very bad things happen, because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not doing their job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By that he implied that the Fed had allowed rates to stay too low, too long meaning that asset prices inflated by cheap money could deflate quickly when rates eventually rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a controversial view, to be fair, with many economists agreeing that the Fed has got itself behind the curve. All the same, analysts are rethinking their expectations for a rate rise, which was nailed on for December until today because a sharp fall in stock prices and all-round uncertainty would not be the moment to increase borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks, research director of City Index, is also thinking about the impact on rates. She told Jill Treanor: The election results so far are having a major impact on the interest rate markets. Market expectations for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve have tumbled to 50%; earlier on Tuesday expectations were more than 80%. The Fed is unlikely to hike interest rates if we see a sharp and prolonged decline in the stock markets, on the back of a surprise Trump win. Back to the stock markets where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking very bloody in the usual parlance. The Nikkei average in Japan is down 4.39%, while the ASX/S&amp;P200 is off 2.23%. Seoul is off 2.46%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down 2.82%. The mainland Chinese markets are not so locked into the global economy and are down a bit less. The CSI300 in Shanghai is down 1.18%. In currencies the US dollar has continued to fall and is now down 3.18% against the yen at 101.792. It has also fallen 1% against sterling and 2.22% against the safe haven Swiss franc. https://twitter.com/TheBY2K/status/796196625626628097 More from Jill Treanor on the trading floor in London on why markets are reacting this way. She writes: So why are the markets reacting like this to the prospects of a Trump victory? Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, tells me it is about uncertainty. The great unknown is the economic policy, based around a trade war with Mexico, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest trading partner, and China, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading partner. Brexit was about UK instability. Trump is about global instability. At spread betters IG, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst, is also making comparisons to the night of the UK referendum, when markets had been pricing in a vote to remain for the EU. Markets are taking the Trump surge on the chin. Risk assets are being heavily sold across the board, with key barometers such as US dollar-Yen and gold reflecting investor sentiment, while the Mexican peso undergoes its own dark night of the soul. It seems remarkable that we are watching this unfold, just a few short months after Brexit. Once again the cat has been set amongst the pigeons. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s path to the White House, so assured just a few hours ago, now looks to be a dead end. 2016 has been a year of upsets, but none will be as big as a Trump victory. Markets are rapidly reassessing whether a December rate hike, also a distinct possibility until this morning, is now off the cards. A lot of comment on the impact on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-anticipated rate rise in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now looking much less likely according to Bloomberg charts as traders price in the shock that is a possible Donald Trump presidency. Also speculation will mount about Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as chair of the Fed given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on her in the presidential debates. Investors and market experts are reacting to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than expected showing. Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. in Florham Park, New Jersey told Bloomberg News: Put your seat belts on because this is going to be a bumpy ride. Investors will be moving in a chaotic fashion to get ahead of the information flow. Nader Naeimi, the Sydney-based head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors, told Agence France-Presse: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite scary. The slightest move towards Trump moved the market very quickly. The slightest change in the odds is amplifying market moves and this just shows there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot at stake. Jill has sent tweeted this from World First in London: Jill Treanor, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking specialist, has got up early to see how foreign exchange traders are coping in London. Jill writes: She is on the dealing floor of World First, an international payments company, where Jeremy Cook has been watching the results come in through the early hours. In the last 90 minutes have started pricing in a Trump victory, the chief economist tells me. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe peso is down 10% agains the US dollar, the Japanese is up 3% against the dollar and gold is up is up $40 an ounce - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big move.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more. The Dow Jones index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key barometer of the US stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is being called to open down 700 points. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger than Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Here is Australia the dollar and the local stock market has been smashed with a 4% loss so far. The big financial stocks are being burned with investment bank Macquarie Group down 3.8%, and insurance giant QBE down 3.6%. the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, is down more than 3%. The Aussie dollar, which has recoverd much ground this year helped by rising commosity prices, has fallen 1.41% to US76.41c. Things moving even more rapidly now despite a likely Clinton win in Virginia. The major equity markets are all down more than 2% now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Hang Seng is off a whopping 3.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and oil is off 4%. A big story is the state of the Mexican peso, which has now lost 11.5% of its value, according to Reuters. Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura in New York, offers Reuters some historical perspective on what this means for US-Mexican relations: This is truly a historic moment. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall such an extreme outlook on the U.S. economy that could be so negative to the Mexican economy. You have to go back to when the United States took half of Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s territory to find such a moment when US politics had such a potential impact on Mexico. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we are so far on this dramatic day. The financial world is bracing for a shock as Donald Trump looks on course to become president of the United States. Stock markets have fallen across Asia Pacific. The Nikkei in Japan is down 2.23% while the ASX is off 1.63% and the Hang Seng is Hong Kong is down 2.57%. Dow Jones will lose nearly 700 points, or more than 3%, when trading opens later today, according to futures trading The FTSE will fall around 240 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or 3.5% The US dollar has plunged against the yen, losing nearly 3% to 102.049 yen. Sterling has risen to $1.2457, its highest for more than a month Gold has spiked 3% to $1,311.80 an ounce Oil is down 2% The Mexican peso is the big loser of the night, falling more than 10% to 20.20 to the US dollar We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually pay much attention to the humble Mexican peso but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting as a pretty good proxy for the state of the markets today. Measured against the US dollar it has plunged more than 7% since Trump emerged as the frontrunner. A story of two walls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the one Trump says he wants to build if elected, and the metaphorical one he wants to erect to protect American goods and services. The FT says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest fall in the peso for 20 years. Gold has spiked by nearly 3% as investors look for safe havens. The spot price stood at $1,311.80 an ounce by 0235 GMT, a rise of 2.9%. Oil, however, is down 2% as traders think a possible Trump victory would be bad for world trade. But Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizuho Bank, told Reuters the reaction in the gold market may be more limited compared with its surge when Britain voted to leave the European Union in June. In this case whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Clinton win or a Trump win, at this point there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nothing left in the tank to aggressively trade gold. Asia Pacific stock markets are now in freefall. The Nikkei is down 2.77%, the ASX is down 1.34%, the Kospi in Seoul is off 1.64% and the Hang Seng is down 1.88%. In futures trading, the Dow is down nearly 500 POINTS. The Vix futures, which predicts the likely course of the volatility or fear index when trading opens in the US on Wednesday, is showing a strong spike: But in an Australian corner of Trumpland it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking a bit rosier. Things are moving quickly now and the markets are taking a real pasting in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Also, the dollar is down 2.5% against the yen More from Justin in Tokyo: Uncertainty over the result in Florida and other key states has sent the Nikkei stock index below the 17,000 line, having made gains earlier in the day. The monitors in this picture show the US dollar-yen rate, which will fall if Trump wins as investors sell the greenback. The bottom figure is the Nikkei share average, also falling on Wednesday lunchtime. With Florida and North Carolina edging towards a win for Trump, the futures market is pointing to a hefty selloff in stocks when markets open in the US and Europe later today, according to IG Dow Jones off nearly 300 points, or 1.6% FTSE off 70 points or 1% Dax down 87 points The markets in Hong Kong and mainland China came a little late to the party this morning and are currently in the red, perhaps reflecting the uncertainty about the Florida vote. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down more than 2%, while the CSI300 on the mainland Shanghai is down slightly. More sanguine elsewhere: Nikkei up 0.85% ASX/S&amp;P200 is up 0.53% Kospi up 0.27% TWSE in Taiwan is up 0.46% A slight detour. Proof that nothing is being left to chance in this election. This man is vacuuming the flags at the Hilton in Manhattan ahead of the Trump/Pence rally later. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know they did that. Volatility is the word for the markets at present with no one quite sure where the Florida poll is heading. In Tokyo, Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, says: Most market participants have priced in expectations that Clinton wins the election. However, early votes will likely sway the market and will cause volatility today Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Gary Huxtable, a client adviser at Atlantic Pacific Securities, said in a note. Volumes are eerily low in the local markets this morning, which means a lot of investors are still sitting on the sidelines waiting for further confirmation of the outcome of the US election. Or man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, is keeping an eye on markets across Asia where trading has become volatile. Markets are open in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong now too: Shares are mostly higher in Tokyo and other Asian markets, the first to open as polls closed in the US. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index added 1.3% in early trading. In a further sign that investors are sticking to their belief that Clinton is heading for victory, the US dollar surged against the yen, a trend that will be welcomed by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters. Elsewhere in the region, South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi index added 0.4% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P ASX/200 jumped 0.8%. The Mexican peso has also seen a good deal of turbulent trading in the past half an hour. Reuters reported that the peso \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a touchstone for sentiment on the election as Republican Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies are seen as damaging to its export-heavy economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c took a dive when Trump was reported to have a narrow lead in the sunshine state of Florida. Still too close to call though by the look of things. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue with charts, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another one showing the peso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading range since midnight UK time: Any doubting how the markets can tell the story, check these out. The ASX in Australia dipped into the red a few minutes ago - as did the Nikkei \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on some reports that Trump was ahead in some groups in Florida. Still unclear but the markets are back in the black now. In case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wondering what to do with your spare cash in the event of a Clinton win, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seven suggestions from MarketWatch*. *Disclaimer: the blog doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any responsibility for the success or otherwise of your investment decisions. For any millennials reading, just think how many Lockheed Martin shares you could buy if you cut back on the avocado on toast. Bourses in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan have opened and will be followed in a little less than half an hour by Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese markets. Most experts expect a Trump win to cause a sharp selloff but economists at the National Australia Bank have been looking at the global economy and they reckon that it has shown great resilience throughout shcks such as Brexit and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise devaluation last year. The upturn in global output has continued at a moderate pace through numerous shocks and growth scares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries, Brexit, Chinese market volatility to name just three \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highlighting the underlying resilience of demand in the big emerging market economies of China and India and the ability of advanced economy central banks to keep the show on the road by means of historically low policy interest rates and asset buying aimed at cutting longer term bond yields. They also see central banks moving towards more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd monetary policy - ie increasing rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Central banks in the big advanced economies may well have now eased their policy by as much as they want to with US attention focussed on the profile of Fed rate rises, the Bank of England moving away from its rate cutting bias, the ECB about to consider if it will cut back its asset purchases next year. Polls have closed now in in the key states of Florida, Ohio and North Carolina (except for the Durham area where there was an earlier problem with technology). When we know how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone, we should get a much clearer picture from the markets. The price of gold, which will spike if Trump looks like winning, is flat at $1,274.90 an ounce. Bloomberg published a very good guide to what to expect from the markets in the event of a Trump or Clinton victory. It fills in a few more details about the patterns I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve discussed so far, but basically this is the synopsis: Trump wins Stocks down, US dollar down against developed currencies such as yen and sterling. Bad for emerging economies all round. Good for bond prices (yields will fall) and very good for gold as investors seek safety. Clinton wins Relief rally on the markets, dollar up against majors and bond prices to fall. Trump may be ahead on the Electoral College count so far thanks to winning in Indiana, as expected, but investors in east Asia are resolute in the belief that Clinton will win: The Nikkei 225 is up 0.7%, or 117 points at 17,297 Kospi in Seoul up 0.4% at 2,010 The markets are opening across more of the Asia Pacific region, notably the Nikkei in Japan and the Kospi in South Korea. Both have followed the lead from the US in the past couple of days so expect to see them rise slightly until we get some results from the States. In the meantime, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth reading what Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics writer Greg Jericho has had to say about the outlook for whoever wins the election. His assessment is that weak growth, lower pay and an ageing population (similar problemns are faced by the Australian economy) spells a probable recession for the next president. Greg writes: If history is any guide, the winner will have to deal with a recession. Read the whole piece here: Currencies will be traded through the day/night and the greenback has edged up a little this morning, reflecting the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pro-Clinton outlook. It rose 0.1% to 105.200 yen and is heading back to its three-month high of 105.540 struck late in October. Other regional currencies have also respoded positively to the prospect of a Clinton win. The Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, whose economies benefit from free trade with the US, rose against the greenback on improved bets for a Clinton victory. The Mexican peso ended 1.4% at 18.32 pesos per dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its highest since 8 September The Canadian loonie rose 0.2% The Colombian peso gained 3.46%, its biggest daily gain in nearly two years. Markets in the US and Europe closed up overnight on the back of that expectation of a Clinton victory, however narrow. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.14 points, or 0.4%, to 18,332.74. The broader S&amp;P500 index also gained 0.4%, to 2,139.56. In London the FTSE closed on Tuesday up 0.5% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 0.2%, The CAC-40 in France was up 0.4%. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark is first out of the blocks in Asia Pacific and it has opened up 0.36%. That looks about par at the moment as golf-fan Trump might say. As this tweet notes, the markets have voted and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve voted for Clinton. As well they might given all the cash they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put her way. Some would say. Hello and welcome to live coverage of market reaction to the US presidential election. This could be a momentous day not just for the American economy but for the world as well. The stakes are high, as reflected in the days-long selloff we saw last week in the wake of the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise intervention in the election. The bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to retreat has had the opposite effect, pushing Hillary Clinton back up in the polls and giving investors a bounce as the prospect of a President Trump ripping up international trade agreements and repatriating manufacturing jobs recedes again. And yet ... many people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least The Donald himself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c point to the failure of pollsters to predict the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit result and how that caught the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 highly paid analysts and experts by surprise. As Chris Weston of IG in Melbourne pointed out this morning (Australia time), the last six polls before the Uk referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u0153averaged 51.7% to 48.3% (3.4 percentage points) for remain!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Referring to the surprisingly strong leave votes in the northern cities of Newcastle and Sunderland early on referendum night, Weston says: As soon as Newcastle and Sunderland broke and the markets thought \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to happen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, then the sky darkened and the markets caved in. This election isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perhaps as binary as the UK referendum, but the way financial markets react today could be fairly similar in the sense that if Trump starts picking up the 50/50 states like Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and potentially some of the more certain Democrat battlegrounds then the market could be wild. So as our excellent election guide says, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to buckle up and prepare for the ride.",

But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably, the US Federal Reserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flanders points out that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates.

In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>And remember, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success or failure won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.</p> <p>At the heart of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis.

Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll.

Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate.

Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks use<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/laffer-curve-napkin-doodle-launched-supply-side-economics\">back of the napkin logic</a> to tell themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these tax cuts will pay for themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (Actually they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t).</p> </blockquote> <p>But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Presidency could bring about \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a rejection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153globalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/economic openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpossible trinity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to achieve.</p> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots more here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/796698770138419201\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Political Economy &amp;

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory. After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points. It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from infrastructure sending). But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or protectionist trade police would hurt them. Bloomberg has a neat summary: Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.3 percent rally. Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent. Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of higher inflation and extra US government borrowing. The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump and Barack Obama have their first meeting since the election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious. Our US politics liveblog has full details. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obama said. Trump said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respect for the president\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very fine man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking a break now, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back with the Wall Street close... Capital Economics says investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans: There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic policies of the incoming Republican administration. However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on track to hit a record close. Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the rally, on predictions that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll benefit from Trumponomics. But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suffer under the next presidency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story of how the Dow defied forecasts and spiked after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory: A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, triggering a late selloff in London. Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as investors come to terms with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success. A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the value of international companies who earn money abroad. So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, finished 0.4% higher though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates) Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America will need a lot more metal to implement Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new infrastructure plan. But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, some by over 5%. The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with Donald Trump, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prejudging him. Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to speculate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about whether Trump would hurt the global economy. Rice added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be making an assessment at that time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are heading lower in late trading, as Trump-inspired volatility grips the City again. The S&amp;P tech stock index has shed 3%, and is on track for its worst day since the Brexit vote (via Reuters). Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president. Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news for the tech sector. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign. Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crashed since Donald Trump pulled off one of the most surprising election results of the age. But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider consequences of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice -- as the protests in New York, Chicago, Boston etc overnight show. Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the world watches him closely. The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably, the US Federal Reserve. Flanders points out that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy: The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates. And remember, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success or failure won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says: This is about the kind of country that America wants to be. At the heart of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election. And most analysts were wrong. There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied since Trump won the presidential race, says Jim Cielinski of Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will not be the same thing as Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the candidate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified. The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean-sweep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward. Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions. For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward. Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are boosted by Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat, as she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d promised to end price-gouging. And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to rebuild American infrastructure. Caterpillar is up 2%. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as the Trump bump reached New York. Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if Republicans won the race for the White House. The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709. And the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too: Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog. Indeed, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be: Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position at the Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months. Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation! The Financial Times has coined this term, to explain the big selloff in bond prices today. The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new president drives up economic growth, inflation, and inflation expectations, with a debt-financed stimulus programme. Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that drives growth and markets are reflecting that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is steepening.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause a bond crash. Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been speaking on CNBC: Greenspan also backed Donald Trump over one issue - the regulation of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector - saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to see Dodd-Frank disappear. Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now. The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies will drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster profit growth consequently boosting inflation. So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation. Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their national debts. The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night. The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06% The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17% Longer-dated debt is also weakening: We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their quantitative easing schemes. So a return to normal levels wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a disaster. Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently. And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European markets are lower as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out. Investors may be taking a big risk by deciding that Donald Trump will become a new man once he crosses the seal in the Oval Office carpet. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump bump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has been based on a somewhat breezy assumption that the new president will successfully implement the debt-fuelled infrastructure programme that many experts support, while ignoring the chance that we actually enter an era of painful protectionism and trade wars. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group in London, has just published a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmust-read\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blog piece, analysing the impact of Trump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The markets seem to have decided that [aggressive deficit-financed state spending] will indeed now happen \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stocks up, commodities up, bonds down. Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not so sure. To adapt a a phrase: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks useback of the napkin logic to tell themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these tax cuts will pay for themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (Actually they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says: Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Presidency could bring about \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a rejection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153globalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/economic openness. And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpossible trinity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to achieve. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots more here: Hello.... the rally in European stocks is petering out. The FTSE 100 has now shed its early gains and is now down 6 points, having been up 50 points at the start. Not clear what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prompted this... Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, is cautiously hopeful that the infrastructure plan proposed by Donald Trump could help the US economy. He just told Bloomberg TV that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcomes and applauds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to renew America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highways, bridges, airports schools and hospitals. It could boost job creation in the short tun, and expand the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity for growth in the medium term, believes Summers - who has often called for more fiscal spending to fight \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecular stagnation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But Summers also sounds deeply concerned, saying Trump needs to propose \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious and concrete plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to address America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic concerns, and surround himself with responsible people with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says calling China a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153currency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is unwise, while repealing the NAFTA trade deal would do enormous economic damage. And Summers, who served under Bill Clinton, suggets Trump cannot be as divisive in government as he was in the campaign. Unless there is a clear sense that all Americans are welcomed and part of his vision of a prosperous America, and all nations are part of his vision o f a prosperous world, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be successful in creating the world we all want to see, Summers concludes. Demand for gold hit a record high yesterday, which tells you a couple of things. 1) There was a massive flight to safe-haven assets as the shock election result rocked Asian and European markets. 2) People are buying gold as a hedge against inflation (the price has risen by 0.3% today). Over in America, Donald Trump is preparing to visit the White House to meet president Obama, following a night of protests against his election victory. Our main liveblog is covering all the details: Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says Donald Trump needs to flesh out his economics plans, fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mann says Trump needs to set out policies to identify sources of growth in the US economy, and make sure the benefits are shared fairly between the American people. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what got him to the White House , the fact that the gains aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t widely shared. The deputy leader of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing CDU party, Michael Fuchs, hopes that president Trump will be more responsible than nominee Trump: The copper prices has hit its highest level since July 2015, up 5% today, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to rebuild America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. And shares in two mining companies, Antofagasta and Vedanta, have both soared by 14% as investors anticipate a new fiscal boost next year. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says copper is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory (which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be much comfort to those on the losing side). He adds: President elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to spend more than $500 billion on rebuilding America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sroads, bridges and airports helped send construction and steel stocks sharply higher following his surprise election win. Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta Resources, also anticipates a boost. He says (via Blooomberg): All that we see for President-elect Trump is that he will focus on building, he will focus on the infrastructure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is what the market is reacting to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory is also driving up the shares of military and defence companies. BAE Systems have jumped by 6% this morning, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spike following the election result. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the City expect Trump to deliver on his promise to boost spending on the US military (which he claimed had become depleted on president Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch). BAE is one of the biggest suppliers to the US department of defence, and makes armoured vehicles, ships, fighter jets and missiles. And if Trump weakens the ties between Nato members, then European countries may feel compelled to boost their own armies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that inflation expectations are rising, via analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group: Predictions that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies will drive US inflation higher are causing some dramatic moves in the financial markets today. The interest rate, or yield, on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bonds just jumped over 1.31%, up from 1.23% on Wednesday night. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since 24th June, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. Other European government bond yields are also rising. Investors are betting that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts and debt-fuelled spending plans, if enacted, would be inflationary. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeking a higher rate of return for holding government debt. The news overnight that Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to force Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to resign has also cheered the markets. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term expires in 2018, but there has been speculation that she might feel pressure to step down, given the attacks from Trump during the campaign. Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, has told Bloomberg TV that market confidence will improve if Yellen stays, adding: If she goes, who knows, because that depends on who comes in next. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry spokesperson has been giving some more reaction to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory at a press conference in Beijing. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vows to introduce a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, spokesperson Lu Kang noted that economic ties were blossoming with trade increasing from $2.5bn in 1970 to $560bn last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic cooperation between China and the US is what has made our bilateral relations stable and has propelled our bilateral relation forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lu said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope US is able to view our economic trade relationship in an objective and unbiased manner and work with us so that we can move forward. I believe that if the US keeps the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest and its people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests in mind, they will make the right decision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked whether such protectionist measures would harm the US-China relationship the spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will not comment on speculation. As I said I believe that the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders will make their decision based on the fundamental interests of their people. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to hit a new record high, when the US stock market opens in five hours. Last night, the Dow closed near to its highest levels, and the future market is predicting a fresh spike today. The prospect of tax reforms and a government spending boost are pushing shares up, says Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First. He says the intial Trump slump has swiftly transformed into the Trump jump: The shortening of the timeframe between decline and rebound could be down to many things but issues around full Republican control of the Presidency and the possibility that changes in tax reform, investment and regulation will come through quicker may help. Trump has also been called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcan inflation time-bomb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 given his pledges to increase spending so we must now look at Fed policy through a new lens. Similarly, although he was elected yesterday he does not take the reins until January 20th. Well quite: Investors are hoping that taking on the presidency might provoke a change in Donald Trump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the market rally is based on: ...an reassessment of views about Trump and belief that a more Presidential individual is already replacing the highly divisive candidate character he merely portrayed in order to appeal to American frustration and win the populist vote. Markets are demonstrating an impressive ability to digest significant political change and move on, even quicker than we saw in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Given some of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct during the election campaign (divisive comments about Muslims, Mexicans, those awful tape-recordings about women...), a transformation by Inauguration Day would be welcome. But is it realistic? Anyone who bought European shares during Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech yesterday morning has made a decent profit. The markets have now gained 4.6% since Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening tumble: European banks are also rallying, on speculation that the next president might unravel some of the regulations brought in since the 2008 crisis. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to tear up Dodd-Frank -- the legislation brought in to protect consumers and prevent banks becoming too big to fail. Trump believes it is holding back the economy, and once told Fox News that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t loaning to people that need it. The regulators are running the banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what Trump would replace Dodd-Frank with; simply ditching the law could create the conditions that caused the credit crisis in the first place. Coper-producer Antofagasta is the top riser in London, with fellow miners Glencore and Anglo American close behind. Traders are betting that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of cutting taxes, a new debt-funded infrastructure programme, would push up inflation and raise demand for commodities. European markets are open, and shares are rising, as predictions of a Trump slump are trampled in an early wave of buying. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 49 points, or 0.7%, to 6960 in early trading. Mining stocks and financial companies are leading the way. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB have also gained around 0.7% to 0.9%. The City analysts who predicted markets would slump if Trump pulled off a shock win have some explaining to do today. The consensus view was that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sheer unpredictability, opposition to free trade, bombastic and often-shocking comments - plus the vague and uncosted nature of his proposals - would scare investors out of town. But instead, we got a knee-jerk selloff yesterday, followed very swiftly by a bounceback (which Asia just caught up with.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lesson to all of us about how markets react, as Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Buy the rumour, sell the news or in this case, sell the rumour and buy the news. We were all told this when we first arrived in dealing rooms and it is used to explain why academics and non-market participants are so often confused by the reaction of markets to events. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I can remember a better example of this maxim than the last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction to changing speculation about the outcome of the US Presidential election, and then to what happened. The result is plenty of egg on the face of all sorts of people. Mine included. So instead, investors quickly began reassessing the implications of a Trump presidency, and a Republican-controlled Congress. Kit says: It is widely expected that President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts, particularly for corporations, that will be positive for growth and will boost inflation. It may not be that simple for Trump to get things done -- the Tea Party wing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the thought of a debt-fuelled stimulus plan, for starters. Good morning from London, where bleary-eyed traders have returned to their desks. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting a repeat of the huge rally seen in Asia overnight - London had its Trump rally yesterday afternoon. But the markets are still expected to rise, as the City continues to defy expectations and take yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock election result in its stride. You might have thought that the sight of anti-Trump demonstrations at several major US cities overnight would alarm the markets. But right now, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more interested in the next president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of a fiscal stimulus. Also, the graceful and mature way that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama reacted to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win has also calmed nerves -- investors like a peaceful transfer of power. A huge recovery on Asia Pacific\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. Plenty of commentators have doubts about whether the upbeat impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory can be sustained across the region but the impact is overwhelmingly positive for now. Here are the main points of the day so far: Share markets had one of their best days for years. The Nikkei rose 6.72% thanks to a weaker yen while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 3.34%. South Korea, Hong Kong and China all up too Europe and the US due to open up The US dollar dipped slightly from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs to 105.2740 Japanese yen while US bond yields spiked amid expectation of Fed rate hike in December Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force Janet Yellen to quit, the WSJ reports China fixes the yuan at its lowest for six years while JP Morgan warns of possible trade shock S&amp;P affirms US AA+/A-1+ rating amid concern about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinexperience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Construction commodities surge with iron ore at 30-month high and copper at 16-month high Thanks for reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the indefatigable Graeme Wearden will take the reins from London in a moment. Oliver Holmes, our south-east Asia correspondent, has been looking at the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win on his business interests in the region. Oliver writes: Despite the global downturn, two companies in the Philippines and Indonesia that are linked to Trump saw their shares soar on news that he had been elected president. Shares in a Philippine firm building a 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila jumped by a massive 20%, from 1.22 to 1.47 US cents on the local stock market. The main index on the Philippine Stock Exchange fell, however, by 2.5%. In Indonesia, shares in a company controlled by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local business partner, tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, also surged by 23%. The Jakarta stock exchange dropped by 1.4% on Wednesday. Trump and Tanoesoedibjo plan to build a resort and a golf course in west Java, projects that many in Indonesia \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest Muslim-majority nation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d condemned last year when Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A huge day for the Japanese stock market which soared 1,092.88 points to 17,344.42, a rise of 6.72%. There have been big moves in the bond markets in the past 24 hours as investors have dumped the safety of government paper in favour of equities and the dollar. Yields on US Treasury 10-year notes reversed an initial plunge to 1.716% and bolted to 2.09% overnight as the price of bonds dropped. The net rise of 21 basis points was the largest daily increase since July 2013, Reuters said. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an expectation that the Fed will raise rates in December, with a possible US fiscal stimulus seeing the return of inflation and more rate rises. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. Futures trading suggests Europe and the US will rejoin the party when the markets open later today. Spread better IG sees the FTSE100 up 0.5% at 6940 points, while the Dax in Germany will be up 0.68% at 10,715 points. The Dow Jones on Wall Street is set to open up around 60 points. The Nikkei has gone even better than the ASX today with a rise nearly 7%, helped by a drop in the yen as the US dollar received a Trump bump as we might now have to call it. But the authorities are still worried that they might have to act to keep the yen down in future. Hiroshi Watanabe, former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, regardless of US concerns about such action. If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good day for investors down under \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the best in fact since 2011, AAP reports. The ASX/S&amp;P200 has closed up 172.2 points, or 3.34%, at 5,328.8 points, adding $50bn to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, more than making up for yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Mining and construction stocks led the way on hopes of a boom in the US. Surging iron ore prices also helped, soaring past the 2016 peak to $71 a tonne. Copper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key construction material \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also jumped 4% to a 16-month high, Reuters reported. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of commentary around today about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies and what they will mean for the global economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already heard from JP Morgan and Saul Eslake. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Bloxham from HSBC in Australia, speaking to Australian Associated Press. For Australia, the main negative impact seems likely to be the effect that reduced global trade could have on Asian growth, given Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high trade reliance. Continued strengthening of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic ties to China should be a priority as it would help support local growth even in the face of rising global trade protectionism. But Standard Life, in a research note quoted by AAP, saw the possibility that Trump could moderate his campaign promises, which included putting tariffs of 45% on Chinese goods and 35% on Mexican goods, in order to avoid disruption. It is plausible that the new administration will not ramp up tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, content instead to bury the prospect of new trade agreements and make more use of enforcement clauses in existing agreements. Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to an adviser, despite speculation that he might try to end her term prematurely. Judy Shelton, an economist and senior fellow at the Atlas Network and adviser to Trump on monetary policy, told the Wall Street Journal that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not urging her to resign at all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the Journal reports that Shelton did concede that Trump was minded to replace Yellen when she completes her first term in 2018. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want someone whose thinking is more in keeping with his own. Trump was openly critical of Yellen in one of the presidential debates in September, saying that interest rates had been kept too low and that asset bubbles created by loose monetary settings would eventually burst. JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team in Australia have been looking at what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win could mean for the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They say that a US fiscal stimulus would have limited benefits for the rest of the world while trade barriers could mean trouble for trading partners. A US policy-induced trade shock will be negative for global growth. This leaves risks to global growth more asymmetric than was previously the case. Second, the distribution of risks to Chinese growth have shifted to the downside, given the increased probability of rising tensions in US-China trade relations and weaker Chinese export growth. A trade shock could in turn damage the US. A marked slowing in US growth might not be an issue, except that growth in the rest of the global economy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look robust enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly given limited scope for additional policy support \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to provide much of a buffer. And even in the event that US growth slows on a trade shock, this will likely be more inflationary (via higher import prices) than would have otherwise been the case, meaning that the growth and inflation trade-off in the US becomes less favourable. And that means that interest rate cuts are back on the horizon in Australia. For the RBA, we think this underscores the risk that rates are likely to go lower in Australia. All else equal, domestic growth needs to be stronger to provide an offset to external shocks, should they occur. US billionaire Carl Icahn apparently cashed in on the stock market panic over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory. The longtime Trump supporter told CNN Money that he left the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory party in Manhattan in the early hours of Wednesday to go home and buy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of stock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the plunging overnight market. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I did that. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what makes me happy today too ... I personally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that Trump is bad for the market necessarily. OK, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacfic shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87 ASX/S&amp;P200 up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010 Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade More on the implications for Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big emerging economies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Australia. Saul Eslake, the independent economist, has warned about the implications for Asutralia if Trump were to start a trade war with China and undermine the Fed, pushing the US dollar down. [This would create] a great deal of uncertainty in our part of the world, about the geopolitical environment by making a less wholesome commitment to longstanding US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan ... Those things, particulary a trade war with China, would be highly negative for Australia. Like every measure in the last 24 hours, the US dollar has been topsy-turvy. The chance of a Fed rate cut dropped to 30% on Wednesday but is now more than 80%, according to IG. The dollar index against major currencies recovered from 95.885 on Wednesday to around 98.448 on Thursday. But the longer-term outlook is uncertain as Trump pushes his protectionist agenda (see below). Tim Condon, an Singapore-based economist at ING, told Reuters: We expect a Trump Treasury to elevate the importance of the bilateral trade surplus with the US in identifying currency manipulators and intensify pressure on trade partners to allow currencies to appreciate. The yuan has been fixed today at 6.7885 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its lowest point since September 2010. Bearing in mind that Trump labelled China a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153currency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on his way to winning the presidency, the issue could prove to be a flashpoint between the two countries. China has pushed the value of its currency steadily downwards in the past year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very clumsily to begin with, sparking last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mini-stock market crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it tries to export its way out of slowing economic growth. But everyone else has got the same idea (including Abe of course). The US dollar is holding its gains on Thursday and was sitting at 105.32 yen, up from below 102 on Wednesday. But for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing recovery to work you expect that he will want it come down. The Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is planning to meet the US president-elect in New York on 17 November, a Japanese government official has said. Reuters reports that the pair had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153talked by telephone and confirmed close cooperation between their two nations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It might be interesting to hear what they have to say to each other about trade and the economy. Like China, Japan has a lot to be worried about. Trump is an avowed opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal which would be a huge blow for Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to boost his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge manufacturing sector. The commodities market is looking slightly different to stocks today. While equities are surging ahead, the price of oil has dropped amid concerns about the impact of Trump on global trade. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 20c at $45.07 a barrel at 0131 GMT on Thursday. The more widely traded Brent was at $46.29 per barrel, down 7% from the last close. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters: The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand. Gold meanwhile dipped overnight $1,278.25 an ounce as risk receded in the markets. It rose nearly 5% to $1,337.40 on Wednesday before tumbling back down as US markets reacted positively to the Trump win. Reuters reports that S&amp;P, the ratings agency, has affirmed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment-grade AA+/A-1+ sovereign rating on Wednesday while maintaining its stable outlook. It welcomed calls for unity from all sides of US politics in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high general government debt and increased uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meant there it could not restore the coveted AAA rating it removed in 2011. Its analysis feels like a good summary of market sentiment: Given Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of experience in public office, and his win as a political outsider without an established policy track record, there is a degree of uncertainty over policy formulation and execution. However, there is a difference between campaign rhetoric and concrete policy proposals and execution once in office. We await further information on the formation of a cabinet and policy proposals, particularly once the president-elect assumes office. Alongside Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, the Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House of Representatives. Hence, the president-elect and the Republicans have a mandate for and ability to effect policy change more easily than with a more divided government in recent years. Trading has been underway for an hour now in Japan and Korea. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the main indexes stand: Nikkei up 5.7% to 17,180 points Kospi in South Korea up 1.7% to 1,991 ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia up 2.88% to 5,305 points The yen, which gained so much during yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, fell sharply overnight as the US dollar recovered. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at 105.6740, close to a four-month high. The pound and the euro are both down slightly against the greenback however, as the pattern from yesterday is reversed. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac in Australia, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waited around to see what a Trump presidency might mean for US monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cut its base rate 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75% this morning. The move was expected and is the third cut this year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driven partly by a need to get the NZ dollar down to help the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge dairy industry. Governor Graeme Wheeler said the rate-setters had met on Thursday to discuss whether the cut was still needed in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win. They decided it was but pushed back on expectations of yet another reduction soon. He said: We think at this stage that we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need another cut. The economy is doing well and you certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to create excessive volatility in respect of interest rates and output in the exchange rate by surprising the market with interest rate adjustments. This is an interesting chart. Wednesday saw one of the biggest drops in volatility ever recorded as the markets quickly put their concerns behind them and went into risk-on mode. But as with Australia, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear where this is going. A Trump presidency promises a more aggressive US trading position which the markets have implicitly welcomed. But not everyone can be winners here, can they? China is the obvious loser in Asia if, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say, Trump tries to force Apple to make its iPhones in the US instead of Shenzhen and Shangahi. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snippet from Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece: Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside: Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems. The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the Nikkei rising more than 6%, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. The Kospi in Seoul is also up. The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. But experts say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com: I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics, but could suffer from the rise in US bonds, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go with those moves higher. Huge lead from Australia this morning. The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up nearly 3% and resource and financial stocks have led the way. The iron ore producer Fortescue is the top riser at well over 10.6% but Macquarie and BHP have also shown big gains. My colleague Melissa Davey has just filed this report on the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge. Meanwhile, Chris Weston at IG in Melbourne has this: The combination of huge gains in materials, fiscals and energy should push the ASX 200 3.4%, which if it closes at that level would be the strongest gain since 6 October 2011 Hello and welcome to the markets live blog from Sydney. Well, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out quite how it was expected to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a number of levels. The surprise of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how they finished in the US and Europe The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. FTSE100 up 1% to 6,911.84 Dax up 1.56% to 10,646 In Australia the market has already taken that lead and opened up by nearly 3%. Can it be sustained? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one informed verdict. Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney, said: The stunning turn in sentiment suggests there is now a consensus building that much of the policy announced during the campaign was a sales pitch rather than a commitment to act. Investors ignored the potential for damage to international trade and growth prospects and focussed on Republican control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. This offers the prospect of reform that could stimulate the US economy. However, last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action may be as good as it gets for markets for some time. Policy uncertainty and populist agendas rarely lead to sustainable economic growth. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much to look at and talk about. But in the meantime start with our economics editor Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s examination of what a Trump win might mean for the global economy.",

                "bodyText":"After a momentous week, Wall Street seems to have simply run out of energy. The Dow Jones index is virtually flat now, up 0.02%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are slightly in the red. Traders are taking a breather, and watching political events unfold. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty happening -- the latest news is that vice-president in waiting Mike Pence has just been appointed to lead the Trump transition team, instead of Chris Christie. Our US politics liveblog has all the details: So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to wrap up for the week now. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial developments. Goodnight! GW JP Morgan analysts are warning tonight that Donald Trump could destabilise the US economy if he slaps tariffs on new imports from abroad: Hopefully they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve sent a copy to their boss, CEO Jamie Dimon -- rumoured to be in the running to become the next Treasury secretary. One other interesting development tonight....It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerged that three employees at major banks have recently been arrested by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Crime Agency as part of a UK insider trading investigation. The arrests are linked to the Panama Papers, and were made in the last few months but only reported today. More here: As currency traders head home, or to the nearest City winebar, they can reflect on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected strength this week. As this chart shows, sterling has gained more than 3% against the single currency this week, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12 to around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that people are hoping that Brexit will be easier with Trump in the White House. But I think the pound is really benefitting from worries about Europe. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum next month, or the French and German elections in 2017, could all undermine the eurozone. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Fears of the rising political right in the Eurozone and potential US instability once Trump takes over are crucially helping to put Brexit on the back-burner for the time being. The US government bond market is closed today for Veterans Day. And bond traders should enjoy the rest while they can - Treasuries will surely be volatile next week too, as the clock ticks towards Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration. Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Julian Jessop predicts further losses, as the markets try to price in the prospect of a new infrastructure spending programme financed by debt. He writes: The election results mean that there may now be a big fiscal expansion, which adds to the downside risks for bonds for at least two reasons. First, it would increase their supply. Second, we think it would mainly boost inflation rather than growth. Jessop also suspects that the Wall Street rally will fizzle out, as investors focus their minds on possible trade wars under President Trump. For a start, the strong performance of some sectors (such as industrials, basic materials and energy) has reflected hopes for a big splurge on infrastructure spending, which we think is unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most of the fiscal stimulus is likely to take the form of tax cuts. Stock markets do not tend to fare well when inflation is rising either. And investors may start to worry again soon about the implications for growth of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other proposals, such as trade tariffs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite for the Mexican economy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid. Its government bonds are weakening again, driving up yields, and the peso is hitting fresh lows: The Trump Jump we saw in the immediate aftermath of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election has hit a hump. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has suffered another day of chunky losses, closing down 97 points, or almost 1.5%. The stronger pound is partly to blame; sterling is up 0.5% right not over $1.26. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains that Brexit anxiety has faded this week. If FTSE bulls were emboldened by Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredible fightback to regain the 7000 mark, they will be feeling somewhat weary today, as the UK benchmark suffered substantial losses amid a comprehensive recovery for sterling. The pound was expected to rise on last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s realisation that Article 50 is now in the hands of Brexit-sceptic MPs, and with the US election now out of the way, we are seeing that pound rebound take shape. Much like a weakening euro was perceived to be good for UK stocks, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pound rally is doing little to help the FTSE, which has suffered more than most. Most other European stock markets also closed in the red, and Wall Street is still down As flagged up earlier, analysts believe Europe will suffer if Trump does manage to boost US growth through tax cuts and a spending boost. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: The new Donald Trump vision for America is drawing the attention of international capital. This renewed belief in a better environment for corporate America is at the expense of Europe and especially emerging markets. The City is also concerned by the heavy losses in the bond market this week, which wiped out around $1trn. That, funnily enough, is also how much has been added to the US equities market this week, according to Bloomberg. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says income inequality helped to drive Donald Trump to the White House. In an interview with CNN, Buffett, who has called for tax reform in the past, says ordinary Americans feel that wealth distribution is unfair: The Forbes 400 [list of wealthiest Americans] had $93bn dollars in 1982, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got 2.4 trillion dollars today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 times as much. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working 40 hours a week, maybe holding a second job and you work with the Little League [junior baseball] and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a good parent, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really struggling. Then you think, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with this picture?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and you want to change the picture. Buffett, worth an estimated $70bn, also criticises Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of free trade, saying protectionism would harm the US economy. But while Buffett isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fan of Trump, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now calling on Americans to back the president-elect. Unity, he says, is now crucial, after a particularly negative and personal campaign: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every important that the American people coalesce behind a president. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t criticise, or disagree with what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. But we need a country unified by a president. Buffett also warns that Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver on all his pledges, such as doubling economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody can grow the economy 4% in real terms over time...The math is too extraordinary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full interview is online here. Speaking of Europe... Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom suggested today that talks with the US about the controversial TTIP agreement will probably be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfrozen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a while now. Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a natural pause, of course, while we wait for the next administration; then, for quite some time TTIP will probably be in the freezer. Then what happens when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defrosted, I think we will need to wait and see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This week can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end enough for City traders, who are sending shares steadily lower in London. The FTSE 100 is now down 116 points, or -1.7%, at 6712. Precious metals firms are leading the rout, along with oil companies and major exporters. Germany is defying the global market selloff today, with its DAX index slightly higher. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to Deutsche Bank, whose shares have surged over 4% today. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speculation that the German lender has a better chance of negotiating a lower penalty with the US Department of Justice, over misconduct before the financial crisis. Deutsche should also benefit from a higher inflation environment; record low interest rates have hurt its profitability. Its share plunged through \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 at the end of September, on fears over its financial health. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14.7 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest threat from the Trump presidency is a new trade war that scuppers exports and growth, says Kallum Pickering of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berenberg bank. He writes: Europe earns almost 20% of its GDP from exports, that is 50% more than the US [see chart below]. European producers would feel the pinch of a more inward-looking and less trade-oriented US. A US shift towards isolationism over the next four years that might then be mirrored by other countries is the major economic risk for Europe following the Trump victory. If Trump does what he said in the campaign, namely brand China as a currency manipulator and place a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, he could trigger a trade war. While Congress would block many of his more extreme policy proposals, such a move would badly exacerbate a tilt in the Western world against globalisation. Trade oriented economies like those of Europe would lose even more from that than the US. After several days of gains, the US stock market appears to be readjusting to the new reality. Some of the shares that have done best since Donald Trump won the election are leading the fallers. That includes drugs firms Pfizer (-2%) and Merck (-1%), who had posted gains after the prospect of a price-gouging clampdown faded with Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory chances. Exxon Mobile is down 1.8% -- it had been another Trump gainer, as the next president is relaxed about the dangers of climate change. And Caterpillar had lost 0.6%; having been driven up by the prospect of new orders for its digging machines to help build new American highways, airports and schools. Just in: American consumer confidence has jumped this month, beating expectations. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has just come in at 91.6, up from 87.2 in October. However... the numbers were collected before the US election results were known. So investors might not read too much into it.... The copper price is in retreat! Having been up almost 10% today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now shed those gains since Wall Street opened. Wall Street is open, for the final trading session of a tumultuous week. And shares are dipping in early trading, pulling the three main indices into the red: Wall Street is about to open, following a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence for Veterans Day (Europeans have already marked Armistice Day). So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catch up quickly: Fears of a new wave of protectionism and a surge of inflation are causing fresh turbulence in the financial markets today, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory continues to grip investors. The British pound has romped to its highest levels since the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of early October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently trading 0.5% higher at $1.261 against the US dollar, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.157 against the euro. Analysts say sterling is benefitting from hopes that Britain and the US could work closely together, in a post-Brexit world. However, we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clue, frankly, about how president Trump will approach international relations. The stronger pound has hit London shares, sending the FTSE 100 down 86 points, or 1.26%, to 6741. Earlier, emerging markets were hit by wild gyrations, with many currencies sliding against the US dollar. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory fuelled fears of weaker global trade and a flow of capital out of the developing world and back into American assets. Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupiah tumbled by 3%, forcing officials to intervene to prop the currency up. And Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso has fallen to a new record low. Commodity markets have also seen drama, with the copper price shooting up. Copper is seen as a bellwether of US economic growth, and the speed of its recent gains have shocked traders. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a very bad week for bond prices. Traders arre ditch sovereign debt in anticipation that inflation will push up. A staggering $1 trillion dollars has been knocked off the market since Monday (leaving the global market worth around $45trn). This is pushing government borrowing costs up, especially for Italy - which might be the next country hit by political instability. The strengthening pound highlights concerns that relations between Europe and America will deteriorate, says Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is trading up, possibly because the risk of Brexit derailing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationships has now been put within a context of President Trump potentially aiming to renegotiate NAFTA. Equally plausible is the risk of Italy exiting the European Union as a result of Matteo Renzi failing to pass constitutional reforms and losing power to the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the possibility that British interest rates will rise sooner than expected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increase in global inflation expectations also puts the Bank of England under scrutiny as one of the first central banks to potentially respond to an increase in inflation by withdrawing accommodation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The futures market is suggesting that the US stock market will fall, when trading begins in around 80 minutes. The Dow is expected to dip by 0.2%, or 38 points, having hit a record high last night. The tech-focused Nasdaq is heading for further losses, down 0.8%. Britain is on the brink of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that will further diminish its standing in the world as it loses free access to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market. So says Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a new, rather depressing, assessment of the UK. In it, S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Moritz Kraemer, says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgulf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Britain and fellow EU members, and big divisions at home: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Far from healing festering wounds, as was then Prime Minister David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention, the referendum has deepened and laid bare the schisms in British society. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the economic impact will hit Britain itself. The second-round effect on the world economy is likely to be more limited, as the UK economy accounts for a small and shrinking share of global GDP.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Julian Jessop of Capital Economics also thinks investors are being too blas\u00c3\u00a9 about the president elect: Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are suffering another bad day, as fears over future trade relations with America keep rising. Mexican government bond prices have hit their lowest levels since February, as the peso keeps sliding to record lows (now at 21.2 peso to the $1). Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, highlights some significant market moves in London: Asset managers Aberdeen and Ashmore are down 5.3% and 6.7% respectively on worries that a spending splurge under Trump could cause the Fed to hike interest rates to fend off inflation. That has hit emerging market bonds, to which both have exposure, hard this morning. The ongoing rally in sterling is boosting the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers, with Next, which has previously warned that the lower pound could result in a 5% increase in prices at its stores, leading the way, up 3.4%. Two moves really stand out, on a day of general market volatility: In case there was any doubt about who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to benefit from a Trump presidency... Yup, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, industrial firms, healthcare providers and traditional energy all UP, with technology and consumer goods firms DOWN. The sharp selloff in emerging market currencies earlier today (details here) appears to have sent a shiver through European markets. After seeing the Dow hit a record high last night, investors are reassessing the situation... so we could see falling shares on Wall Street too. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Markets awoke with a change of heart during early trading on Friday with emerging market stocks descending into the abyss as fears heightened over higher US interest rates under new US President Donald Trump. Copper is continuing to defy the wider losses, driven by hopes of a new US infrastructure-spending plan. The copper price has jumped another 5% today towards $5,900 per tonne, the highest since June 2015. City investors should certainly keep an eye on the protests taking place in major US cities since the election, as they ponder how events will play out. The scale of the anger about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory may shake any breezy complacency that the next president can simply unite the country, push some tax cuts through Congress, and kick off a Keynesian-style rebuilding project. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: The social unrest over in the US represents a risk for markets which traders should not ignore. This is very important and President Trump needs to address this issue as he has taken custody of a divided country. Yes, the equity market has achieved another record high over in the US, however, if these protests picked up more steam, we could have some serious problems which could be followed by a sharp sell-off for the market. Investors could lose the confidence and that might result in a move from risk on trade to risk off trade. Aslam also reckons that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory could help Britain as it exits from the EU: As for the UK, Theresa May, is going to take advantage of the situation as Donald Trump was a big supporter of Brexit. She has been invited to the US, the trade discussion will be on the forefront. The odds are higher that Donald trump will be a lot more relaxed in relation to striking some exclusive deals with the UK. If Theresa May becomes successful in carving some special deals with the US, it will make the matter a lot easier in achieving a similar goal with other countries like China and India All Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have all slid into the red, following the heavy losses in some emerging markets overnight. Some traders are anticipating that the European economy may also be buffeted by events in America. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The new Donald Trump vision for America is drawing the attention of international capital. This renewed belief in a better environment for corporate America is at the expense of Europe and especially emerging markets. The strengthening pound is a punch in the stomach for the British stock market. The FTSE 100 has now shed 75 points, or -1.1%, at 6752, dragged down by international firms who earn in dollars. Shire Pharmaceuticals and Rolls Royce, the engine maker, are both down over 3%, while Standard Chartered (-4.7%) continue to suffer from the turmoil in its key Asian emerging markets. And the smaller FTSE 250 is also suffering, down 0.9%. After some short-term gains after the US election, the City is now bogged down with the thorny question of what the next US president will actually do. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains: The initial bounce was driven by a realisation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure stimulus would indeed come to pass, but since then investors have been scrambling to work out all the other implications, and this will take far longer. In this climate of uncertainty, markets such as the FTSE 100 now look expensive for now, especially with a rising pound. Predictions of higher American inflation (and interest rates) have pushed the US dollar up against almost every major currency this week. The pound, though, is a rare winner - perhaps showing that Brexit fears have either eased or simply been temporarily ignored. Norman Lamont, a former British finance minister, claims that European leaders will be spooked by the double-whammy of the Brexit vote and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win. He argues that the two events are different -- Brexit is about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the whole world, he insists, while Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on trade are clearly different. But still: On the whole, the psychological factor is one that will worry the Europeans quite a lot. The pound has now gained one percent, or 1.25 cents, against the US dollar this week -- making it a rare winner from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory. The pound is now higher than its levels before October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver suggests sterling is benefitting from the prospect of America and Britain remaining close (despite political upheaval in both counties this year). The pound may be receiving additional support as President-elect Trump emphasises that the US and the UK will continue to enjoy a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very special\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relationship. The pound has also gained ground against the euro, up almost one eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.161. That means one euro is now worth 86.1p. Tony Cross, analyst at TopTradr, says fears of European political instability are pushing sterling up. Granted it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting from a low base given the beating the currency took, both from the shock Brexit vote and the flash crash just over a month ago, but this is increasingly looking as if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been overdone. Critically there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing concern that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a rising tide of nationalism across continental Europe, with French elections in the new year a real cause for concern, pushing EUR/GBP down to below 0.8700 for the first time since late September. Zing! Sterling has just jumped over the $1.26 mark for the first time in five weeks, a gain of 0.5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving (slowly) towards the levels seen before prime minister Theresa May pledged to start the Brexit process by March 2017 (when the pound was worth $1.30). Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election success seems to have shunted concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future onto the back burner - for the moment, anyway: Newsflash: The Mexican peso has hit a new record low, as the turmoil in emerging market currencies continues. The peso has just lurched down to 20.8385 against the US dollar, as traders expect shockwaves from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win. In another alarming move, the yield on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bonds have hit their highest level in a year. There are fears that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, will lose his referendum on constitutional reform next month, triggering a new bout of political instability. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped 26 points in early trading, to 6801, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 80-odd point decline. So-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdefensive stock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as utility companies and tobacco makers are up -- after all, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still need energy and water next year. But Standard Chartered, the bank with plenty of exposure to Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging market, have dropped almost 5%. The pound is also pushing higher this morning, now at $1.26, which is dragging down the share price of internationally-focused companies. European markets are a little higher, though, after German financial giant Allianz reassured investors by reporting better-than-expected profits. Emerging market currencies are also being hit by the prospect that US interest rates will be raised next month (making the US dollar more attractive). FXTM vice-president of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, reckons the Federal Reserve is under strong pressure to deliver a hike in December: While the declines seen in Asian currencies are being linked to the impact of trade throughout the continent if Donald Trump enforces protectionist trade policies, the return of expectations that the Federal Reserve will still raise US interest rates in December is strengthening the Dollar and also pressuring the emerging market currencies. If the Federal Reserve do not raise US interest rates in December as they have been preparing the markets towards for months following such a spectacular rebound in stocks after the victory by Trump, it will raise questions over credibility and concerns that they are worried about Donald Trump taking over office in January. The government bond selloff is continuing this morning, as investors continue to anticipate that Trumponomics will push up inflation. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year gilt is falling, driving up the yield (interest rate) on the bond to 1.4% for the first time since June, up from 1.34% last night. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky move, pushing up the Westminster government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing. French, German,Spanish and Portuguese bond yields are also falling today, as money pours out of sovereign debt Reminder: yields rise when prices fall, as investors are demanding a higher rate of return for holding the debt. Bloomberg reports that more than $1trn has taken out of the bond market this week alone: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild day in the emerging markets, as nervous traders fear a new wave of American protectionism. Currencies stumbled and shares slid amid worries that exports will fall once Donald Trump is in the White House. There is also angst that some of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capital that has flowed to developing countries will soon move back to the US. Indonesia suffered a bad day - the authorities were forced to intervene in the foreign exchange market after the rupiah plunged 3%, its biggest drop in five years. This also sent shockwaves through Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market -- the Jakarta Composite fell over 3%, on track for its worst day in a year. Among other emerging market currencies, South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won lost 1.1 per cent, the Taiwanese dollar Indian rupee shed 0.5%, while the Thai baht is down 0.4 per cent. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good time to be a peso, either. The Philippine peso has hit a seven year low, while its Mexican counterpart has fallen back towards record levels due to worries about the Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-Mexico stance. More details here: Good morning. Forty eight hours after the US election results flooded in, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory over Hillary Clinton continues to reverberate through the financial markets. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a real sense of fatigue this morning, as traders try to anticipate the next few moves and analysts frantically assess the implications of a Trump presidency and a Republican-dominated White House. Last night, the Dow Jones index hit a new all-time high - a phrase we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate writing when a swathe of key battleground states went Republican red in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Wall Street traders are piling into companies such as Caterpillar, anticipating a new infrastructure programme. Banks are also in demand, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition team signal that they will dismantle the Dodd-Frank regulations. But money continues to flow out of government government bonds at an alarming rate, driven by predictions that the tax cuts and debt-fuelled stimulus plan promised by Trump would drive up inflation. RBC Capital Markets explain why investors think the US economy might get a lift, at least in the short term: Given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election night speech and the generally feel-good vibe raining down on Trump from within his party, there is reason to be optimistic. Time will tell. But if you were to press us on the economic impact, directionally we are inclined to believe the net result will be positive. Practically speaking it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to make a call on how the Republican sweep impacts the economic outlooks over the medium term without having a concrete framework of legislative measures in place. But if the conciliatory messaging from the Congressional Republicans and President-elect Trump are any indication, we could be poised for some significant pro-growth initiatives very early on in the administration. We note that corporate tax reform is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-hanging fruit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and we would add regulatory reform to that list as well (given the rhetoric over the last 24 hours). BUT....Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-immigrant, anti free-trade stance is also sending a chill across developing markets - who have benefitted from the increased pace of globalisation in recent years. Jeffrey Halley, a market strategist at Oanda Asia Pacific in Singapore, says big changes are afoot, telling Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a big rotation out of emerging markets into U.S. dollar assets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An emerging market is a market you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t emerge from in an emergency. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the best lessons I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever learnt in 30 years in the market. When everybody runs for the door at the same time, the door\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very small.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So 2016 could yet end with a bout of market instability, or worse, as everyone wonders what next year will hold. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

But we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US.</p> <p>Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th November. This reflects investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets Update, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even more bearish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c forecasts for Treasuries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, published on Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead.</p> <p>For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone.</p> <p>Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the euro-zone.</p> <p>Third, following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory has stoked fears of more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in France, in spring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to contain yields there. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5829eeece4b0eb4ebf273f88\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T17:21:36.966Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets edge higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory.

He has threatened China with heavy tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that was central to President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its own version of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TPP.</p> <p>If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending plan, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less impressed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mainly benefit the better off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveRattner/status/798158448072527873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The irony of Trump&#39;s populism: 51% of his tax cuts go to the top 1%; only 0.8% to bottom 20%.

The bipartisan and independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we know of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth becomes seriously impaired.</p> <p>The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes mired again in rising public deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember debt will be rising anyway in the 2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be accentuated.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1/status/798141658512654336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My take on Trump&#39;s economics.

Second, the economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP growth.</p> <p>The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 86% in fiscal 2026. </p> <p>However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows that the plan would be pricy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous. </p> <p>The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a stimulus boost right now:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has been 98% of the time over the past 50 years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down. </strong></p> <p>But... if Kelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not sparking a manufacturing revival).</p> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly if the Federal Reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest rates.</p> <p>The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. Immigration reform designed to <em>increase</em> skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f015883600ba84c348975d553a6ae3a2b364c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f015883600ba84c348975d553a6ae3a2b364c0/0_236_4809_2886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On your marks!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hare-raising fiscal outlook means Trump should perhaps resist shelling out on new highways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gk Hart/vikki Hart/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T13:20:51.341Z\">at 1.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58299cf6e4b0364c919467eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T11:33:47.991Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their highest in 16 months.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/798122001307209728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ITALIAN 30-YEAR BOND YIELDS HIT HIGHEST SINCE JULY 2015, UP AROUND 20 BASIS POINTS ON DAY AT 3.34 PERCENT</p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaOne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/798122001307209728\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month.</p> <p>Renzi hinted this morning that he might <strong>quit</strong> if the public reject <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/could-italys-renzi-be-next-victim-of-an-unwanted-referendum\">the proposal to reform the Senate</a>.</p> <p>Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close.</p> <p>The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of stagnation and political quicksand).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andreavogt/status/798092480231129088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Renzi?src=hash\">#Renzi</a> survive amidst the right &amp;  left&#39;s referendum pincer movement? 6 mos ago u didn&#39;t see graffitti like this in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bologna?src=hash\">#Bologna</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/blpOYOAHdZ\">pic.twitter.com/blpOYOAHdZ</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Vogt (@andreavogt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreavogt/status/798092480231129088\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T11:13:30.804Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in!

                "bodyText":"The prospect of increased US spending and rising interest rates has pushed the dollar index above 100 for the first time since December. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: The dollar index does appear to be a little bit overbought around these levels, though technically the trend looks strong as it resides inside a bullish channel and above the main moving averages. So, a short-term pullback would not come as a surprise to me, before we potentially see higher levels. That being said, the 100 level has now been tested several times since March 2015. The more a level is tested, the more likely it will break in the direction of the test...It should be noted that if the dollar were to rise further then this will be bad news for US stock. Up until now, they have been rising and falling in unison. This relationship cannot continue indefinitely as the appreciating dollar is supposed to weigh on company earnings. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. European bond yields are unlikely to rise as fast as those in the US following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock presidential election victory, says Capital Economics Simon MacAdam: In the wake of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election, we are nudging up our forecasts for government bond yields in Europe. But we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US. Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th November. This reflects investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets Update, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even more bearish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c forecasts for Treasuries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, published on Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead. For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone. Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the euro-zone. Third, following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory has stoked fears of more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in France, in spring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to contain yields there. Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory. With bond markets under pressure on the basis that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency could see increased spending and a rise in inflation, equities have been a partial beneficiary. In the bond market, Italian 10 year yield rose 18 basis points at one time to their highest since September 2015, German 30 year yields were at their highest for six months while US 10 yields were at their highest since December. However bond prices have since regained some ground, meaning yields are off their highest levels. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The recent resurgence of inflation expectations, coupled with a remarkably buoyant stock market, point towards a likely rate hike in December, and this has helped fuel the drive towards the dollar and away from US treasuries. In equities, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 22.75 points or 0.34% higher at 6753.18 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.24% to 10,693.69 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.43% at 4508.55 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 8658.2 But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.75% to 16,686.33 amid nervousness ahead of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forthcoming referendum In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.47% to 579.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points at 18824, having earlier hit an intra-day record of 18934. US technology stocks are missing out on the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current rally, on fears that some of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies will prove unfavourable. Talk of the president-elect slapping tariffs on Chinese goods raised fears of retaliation which could hit the likes of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expansion plans. Even the prospect of tax breaks allowing such companies to repatriate some of their cash piles has not proved to be much support for the shares. Nor are the major tech companies likely to benefit from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed programme of infrastructure spending, said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets: Tech stocks like Facebook and Netflix won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any government contracts in a rise in infrastructure spending but Chinese expansion plans are at risk by possible trade tariffs. So Apple is currently down 3.2% while Facebook has fallen 3.7%. More fallout from the strong dollar: oil prices are heading lower again. It is not just the dollar hitting crude, however. Investors had been hoping that a key Opec meeting at the end of this month would agree measures to curb output and thus support prices. But the closer the meeting gets, the more the doubts grow and put pressure on the crude price. So Brent is currently down 1.59% at $44.04 a barrel while West Texax Intermediate has slipped 1.68% to \u00c2\u00a342.68. Over in Greece, government officials are preparing for a new round of talks with inspectors representing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign lenders following Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary call for Athens to be granted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful debt relief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Rarely has there been such desire from a sitting government in Athens to conclude a review with auditors representing the bodies that have thrice bailed out Greece since 2010. Highlighting that sentiment, the new government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters earlier that differences between the two are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very small.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The talks, which begin in earnest tomorrow, will focus on an overhaul of labour laws including annulment of collective work agreements and mass firings (a red line many in the ruling left wing Syriza party), privatisations and primary surplus targets for 2019. Next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget will also be discussed. The goal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one dismissed as untenable by most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is for the inspection tour to be wrapped up in a matter of days in the hope that debt relief talks can begin when euro zone finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on December 5. If debt-serving costs are brought down, it will reduce the need for the country to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus by 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a target set by lenders but almost unequivocally derided as impossible to meet. Ahead of president Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the Greek capital on Tuesday the government has gone out of its way to play up the two-day visit with Tzanakopoulos saying today that it had not only been heartened by his intervention on the matter of Greek debt but calling the tour one of great significance. The trip, which will see the US president flying straight to Berlin after Athens, is expected to be heavy on symbolism as Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last state visit abroad. To date only the IMF has highlighted the problem of a debt load it has long called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unmanageable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek officials now hope the US leader will bring pressure to bear on the German chancellor when he, too, highlights the issue in talks between the two on Wednesday. The pound continues to weaken against the dollar as the US currency benefits from talk of an interest rate rise in December after all, despite the shock US election result. Sterling has extended its falls and is now down 1.17% at $1.2450. But against the euro, the pound is holding steady, up 0.09% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1622. US markets are on the rise at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a new record high - just two trading days after the previous peak. The Dow is currently up around 45 points or o.24% at 18893, having reached 18,918, ahead of the previous record of 18,873 hit last Thursday, as equities continued to welcome Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory, even if bond markets do not. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.21% while the Nasdaq composite added 0.15% initially. Time for a quick catch up. The bond market has suffered fresh losses today as investors rapidly adjust to the prospect of Donald Trump taking control of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Debt prices have fallen sharply again, adding to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1trn bloodbath, on the prospect that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering a world of higher inflation, interest rate hikes, political uncertainty and possibly trade disputes too. The selloff has hit US bond prices. The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has hit its highest level since January, rising to 2.23% from 2.1% last week. Shorter-dated two-year debt, and long-dated 30-year bonds, also hit their weakest points since the start of the year. Investors are betting that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure programme, and his plan to cut taxes, will reflate the US economy. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, believes the bond market selloff could intensify: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sentiment surrounding a rate hike has been flip-flopping and that only makes bond buying, especially at around the 1% mark for two-year bills, a more appealing proposition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to pile resources into infrastructure to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMake America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has arguably upped the risk of investing in Treasury yields. The 11-month high of 1% might not be the high water mark for 2016 as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy is put into action.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [remember: bond yield rise when price fall] UK borrowing costs are also being driven up. The 10-year gilt yield has hit its highest level since May, at 1.45%. The dollar is strengthening, hitting an 11-month high against the euro, and against a broad basket of currencies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also gained one cent against the UK pound, at around $1.25. And the markets reckon that the Federal Reserve is nailed on to raise US interest rates in December: But....a string of experts are voicing concern about Trumponomics: JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Kelly thinks slashing taxes and driving up borrowing risks pushing the US deficit into dangerous heights, and simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary right now. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers thinks the infrastructure plan appears to be badly designed And George Magnus, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-respected former chief economist, fears that Trump could trigger pain through the global economy if he takes a protectionist approach. Over the weekend, Trump started to step back from some of his more extreme positions. That wall between America and Mexico might be downgraded to a mere fence, in places, for example. And investors find that sort of u-turn encouraging, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Markets are showing that investors continue to believe the fiscal policy plans by Mr Trump and they want to pile their bets in equities. A risk on trade has become the famous trade amid traders and hence for the past week, since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, we are seeing the precious metal along with other safe haven like the Japanese yen selling off sharply. Mr Trump has delivered many watered down versions of his controversial views over the weekend. This has restored further confidence that the person in charge of the biggest economy of the world, has started to think more logically. It is this certainty which investors are applauding. However... appointing the head of far-right website Breitbart as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chief strategist and senior counselor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest Trump is backing away from the view that appalled liberal critics. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock win is an alarm call to moderate politicians to improve workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conditions, argues the head of the International Labour Organisation. Guy Ryder believes that the US election result, and the Brexit vote, show that many workers feel sidelined and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdispossessed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: He tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are getting a raw deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the people who feel they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefited from globalisation and from the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the dispossessed in that regard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ryder was speaking as the ILO launches a new report, showing that temporary work, agency work, precarious self-employment and other non-standard forms of employment have all spread. We now have a hat-trick of warnings about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans. George Magnus, the former chief economist of UBS, is very concerned that the next president could kick off a trade war that harms America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and the rest of the world too. In a new blogpost, Magnus writes: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehemently anti-free trade rhetoric has included the threat to rip up or change NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Association agreement, including the possibility of levying tariffs on Mexico, and this, on top of erecting the wall, or otherwise restricting immigration. He has threatened China with heavy tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that was central to President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its own version of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TPP. If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global economy. Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending plan, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less impressed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mainly benefit the better off. And the other BIG worry is that Trump could drives up the US national debt to alarming levels. Magnus says: The other major concern about Trumponomics is about a mishandled fiscal expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt. The bipartisan and independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we know of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth becomes seriously impaired. The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes mired again in rising public deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember debt will be rising anyway in the 2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be accentuated. The early rally in European stock markets is fading, as City traders look nervously over to America. The main indices have dipped, having jumped 1% early this morning. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcheck on the global financial markets is a pounding mass of red right now: Each column shows how an asset class has performed. So from left to right, you can see that Most emerging economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity markets have fallen today as investors dump shares. Most currencies have fallen against the US dollar today, including the yen, euro and Turkish lira There have been heavy losses across the government bond markets today, both in developed and emerging economies The cost of insuring those bonds against default, using a credit default swap, has risen (showing that investors see government debt as riskier) But the prices of iron ore, zinc and lead have risen Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers shares JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure investment plan. Writing in the Financial Times, Summers argues that the scheme won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address the parts of America that most need improving, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get key private sector investors involved, and risks pushing borrowing to dangerous levels: Summers argues: Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total private sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, not reach many of the most important investors, and involve substantial mis-targeting of public resources. Many of the highest return infrastructure investments \u00e2\u20ac\u201d such as improving roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or modernising the air traffic control system \u00e2\u20ac\u201d do not generate a commercial return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program. I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any responsible economist has to recognise that, past a point, it can lead to some combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class Summers, of course, has been urging Western politicians to spend more on infrastructure projects for years, so his opposition is a slight surprise.... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to boost US economic growth by rebuilding the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure is dangerous and unnecessary, claims JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global strategist, David Kelly. In a new note to clients, Kelly argues that the US economy is not under-performing at present, and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be helped by a large debt-fuelled stimulus. Kelly is also concerned that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tax cut plans would send the national debt clock up to 100% of national output. First, the federal budget is already dangerously out of balance. Second, the economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP growth. The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 86% in fiscal 2026. However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact. Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows that the plan would be pricy: It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous. The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless. And if that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a stimulus boost right now: The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has been 98% of the time over the past 50 years. Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down. But... if Kelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not sparking a manufacturing revival). He concludes: In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly if the Federal Reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest rates. The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. Immigration reform designed to increase skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating. Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their highest in 16 months. Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month. Renzi hinted this morning that he might quit if the public reject the proposal to reform the Senate. Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared: If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close. The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of stagnation and political quicksand). Just in! The interest rate on short-dated American bonds has hit its highest level since the start of the year. Two-year US treasury bills are now yielding 1% for the first time since January, as prices are dragged down by the wider bond rout today. Most Asian stock markets have fallen today. They were hit by fears that emerging markets will suffer from a stronger US dollar (luring capital back to America) or trade protectionism. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index shed almost 1.4%, finishing the day on (an auspicious?) 22,222.22 points. Over the weekend, US blogger and portfolio manager Matt Busigin argued that the financial markets are making a serious mistake in their analysis of the looming Trump presidency. He argues that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve focused on the likely results of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises, without also factoring in just how much instability America could experience under their new leader. In his view -- investors should be a lot more risk-averse. [that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nominal GDP - or the real growth rate plus the inflation rate] If Busigin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, we could see a sharp correction if a) investors get nervous, or b) Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration does indeed struggle. Many analysts think the global bond rout is only just beginning. It will take a while for investors to properly adjust their portfolios - especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gorged on low-yielding government bonds because they expected many more years of low inflation. Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of European macro research at Goldman Sachs, has predicted that the yield on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year Treasury bills will keep rising: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prospect of US fiscal stimulus under the new government has increased our conviction that the US 10-year yield will reach 2.5 per cent in 2017, possibly faster than we earlier assumed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency brings fiscal spending or protectionism, we think either scenario would boost inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [reminder, the 10-year yield crunched through 2.2% this morning] The US dollar has hit an 11-month high against a basket of other currencies this morning. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the greenback is going from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strength to strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, amid predictions that US interest rates will rise faster than previously expected. A Trump win had initially cast doubt on the probability of a rate increase in December, with the markets pricing in just a 50% chance of a hike on election night; however, this has since rebounded back. With unemployment historically low and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy spending plans taking shape, inflation could well charge higher more quickly than initially forecast. Two rate rises had been pencilled in for next year, but if Trump decides to front load his spending then we could expect more rises through the year, resulting in the dollar pushing further northwards. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term borrowing costs are also rising today, as the global bond market suffers from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trumpflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worries. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that investors are shifting money out of government bonds and into other assets. Reuters has a good take: German 30-year bond yields broke through 1% for the first time in more than six months on Monday, as investors dumped bonds on bets that the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will push up inflation. In a broad debt market sell-off, Italian 10-year yields broke above 2% for the first time since September 2015and U.S. 30-year yields topped 3% for the first time since January. German 10-year yields -- the euro zone benchmark -- rose to their highest since January, extending their biggest weekly rise this year after Republican Trump unexpectedly defeated Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a continuation of this recent trend. There are still these expectations that inflation could go up if the U.S. takes a more expansionary fiscal stance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said. The US dollar is strengthening this morning, hitting \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.075 against the euro. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since January. On the one hand, the dollar is benefitting from the prospect of higher American interest rates. On the other, concerns of rising populism and political crises in Europe has been undermining the euro in recent weeks. The pound has also lost ground against the dollar, dropping one cent below $1.25 (which has helped to push the FTSE 100 index up). Its shares 1, bonds 0 this morning. European shares are all rallying in early trading, led by financial stocks and mining companies. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 82 points to 6814. House builder Taylor Wimpey is doing well, up 4% after reporting that the Brexit vote hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt trading. Barclays is up 3%. Banks should benefit if interest rates rise to calm inflation. And commodity prices are also benefitting from the prospect of a new US fiscal splurge (Trump will need a lot of copper and iron ore to rebuild America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure), so Anglo American and BHP Billiton have gained 2%. US bond prices are also falling this morning, driven by expectations that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promised policies would drive up inflation. The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has jumped to 2.23%, from 2.13% on Thursday night [the market was closed on Friday for Veterans Day]. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since January, and quite a substantial move, underlining how assets are being rapidly repriced... Government bonds are being hit hard in early trading as investors pick up where they left off last week. The prices of US and European government sovereign debt are falling sharply, following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff which wiped $1 trillion dollars off bond prices. The move is being driven by concerns that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for a debt-fuelled stimulus programme, and hefty tax cuts for richer Americans, will drive inflation up. The yield (or interest rate) on UK 10-year government debt has jumped over 1.42% this morning, up from 1.36% on Friday night. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest yield since the end of May, before the Brexit vote. German bonds are also being driven down from their recent record highs. The yield on benchmark 10-year bunds hit a nine-month high this morning at 0.35% These moves mean that any investors who bought bonds before last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff are facing losses. They also indicate that governments must pay a higher interest rate when they sell bonds in the market to fund their deficits (compared to a few weeks ago). Bloomberg are calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal bond rout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saying: A global bond rout is intensifying, sending U.S. 30-year yields above 3 percent for the first time since January, on speculation Donald Trump will increase spending to boost the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. November is typically a time for investors to reflect about what went right, and wrong, that year and to ponder what might be coming next. And after the US elections last week, City experts have a lot of rethinking to do. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, so soon after the Brexit vote, has shaken many of the old certainties that have underpinned investment strategies for years. Inflation is back in town, as the president-elect plots a financial stimulus programme that could sent America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt spiralling (even) higher and force inflation out of its rut. And free trade is looking vulnerable too, with China threatening to hit American imports unless the next leader of the free world reins himself in: All of a sudden, putting one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money into government bonds at record high prices (and thus record low returns), may not feel like such a smart move. Eric Peters, the boss of One River Management, talked about the shock of waking up in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in his latest note to clients: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we saw bond prices slide last week, as people moved swiftly to reposition themselves. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably see more significant shifts in asset prices this week. Also coming up today.... Japan has smashed expectations overnight, by reporting that its economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.2% in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better than the 0.9% which economists expected. The recovery was due to a jump in exports, so could be vulnerable if the global economy deteriorates. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mop up some reaction shortly. And UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and bookmaker William Hill are both reporting financial results, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll watch for any interesting angles there too.",

After all, the idea of such a stimulus is to temporarily support the economy during downturns. There is a growing literature showing that fiscal multipliers are much smaller when the economy is close to potential or full employment. That means that one gets less bang for the buck. Moreover, as highlighted already by Milton Friedman, poorly timed policies add instability to the economy, potentially exacerbating rather than damping business cycles. They initially may cause overheating and higher inflation, and then a deeper recession.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582b17b8e4b0eb4ebf2744bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-15T14:36:11.276Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The strong US retail sales figures have only added to the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

The figures were stronger than the consensus expected (+0.6% month on month), and stronger still when upwards revisions to the previous months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data are taken into account.</p> <p>The strength in sales was also matched with its breadth and only a few sub-categories registered month on month declines (furniture (-0.9% month on month, dept stores -0.7% month on month, and eating/drinking -0.7% month on month).</p> <p>While a December hike looks as close to a done deal as one ever gets in markets, there are still questions about 2017 Fed policy. Markets are currently optimistic about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal expansion in the US next year, and downplaying risks of a more deflationary protectionist policy mix. This might be right.

                "bodyText":"The weaker than expected UK inflation figures have put pressure on the pound again, pushing it lower against the dollar and the euro. Sterling is currently down 0.4% at $1.2433 against the dollar, and the same amount lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1585. Meanwhile the dollar itself is on the rise after the latest US economic data - stronger than expected retail sales - pointed once more to an interest rate rise next month. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping back after several days of gains, European markets ended the day in positive territory. The UK market was helped by weaker than expected inflation figures, which pushed back the chances of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets rose once more today, as hopes of a high growth period based on substantial fiscal stimulus continued to stoke the embers of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US election... we have seen energy stocks grab some respite today, as crude prices rose in the wake of a fresh charge from OPEC to find a means to ensure the output cut comes to fruition. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.56 points or 0.59% at 6792.74 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.39% to 10,735.14 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.62% at 4536.53 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was virtually unchanged, down just 0.02% at 16,682.37 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8687.1 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% at 578.17 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.14%. Elsewhere, crude has been buoyed by renewed talk that oil producers are trying to pave the way for an agreement on curbing output later this month. Brent crude is currently up 4% at $46.24 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has jumped 4.4% to $45.24. Reuters has reported that Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is expected to travel to Qatar this week for a meeting with producers. The outline of a deal to limit output was agreed by Opec in Algiers in September, but the details have proved difficult to agree. Not everyone is happy with Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence in Greece. Helena Smith reports: Thousands of protestors have taken to the streets in a mass display of opposition against Obama. Despite a government ban on protestors taking place during the 29-hour period the US president is expected to be in the Greek capital as many as 3,000 people, many communists and hardline leftists, have defied the order to gather in central Athens and march towards the US embassy. Some are carrying placards proclaiming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwanted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd others decrying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capitalism and imperialism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Riot police have been dispatched with organisers, including Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister and far left leader of the pro-drachma, breakaway Popular Unity party, denouncing the prohibition as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal and provocative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Greece prepares to mark the November 17 anniversary commemorating the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against US-backed military rule. Here are Obama and Alexis Tsipras, courtesy of the White House, with the US president saying he would continue to urge Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to take the steps needed to put the country on the path to a durable economic recovery: After six straight days of rises, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is pausing for breathe. It is currently down 26 points or 0.15%, but the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both moved higher at the open. More from Obama on debt relief for Greece: And on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras says he is hopeful Germany will back debt relief (which may be an heroic assessment): And here are Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. Helena reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have always wanted to come to Greece ... I think we all know that the world owes an enormous debt to Greece and the Greek people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obama also told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ideas of ancient Greeks helped inspire our founding fathers \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.to this day the United States is profoundly grateful to our Greek friends. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know this has been a painful and difficult time \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this crisis is not an abstraction but has a very concrete and devastating impact on people in this country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was, he said, now very important that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greeks see improvements in their daily lives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to Greece again, where the US president has begun his farewell tour of Europe. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Barack Obama may be visiting Athens at the end of his time in office but the outgoing US leader has not disappointed. Barely three hours after he touched down in a Greek capital rendered almost unrecognizable by draconian security, Obama said the three words Greek officials have wanted the world leader to utter: debt, austerity and solidarity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will continue to underline that austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras after being greeted by the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of state and the rousing tones of a military honour band. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Debt relief is needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier he had said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has gone through very challenging and dramatic times over the last several years. We are glad to see that progress is being made, although we recognise that there are significant challenges ahead, and we intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Greek people throughout this process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist led government has made little secret that it hopes the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open display of support will resonate with Germany and other partners in Europe which have footed the bill of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive bailouts but demanded punishing belt-tightening in return. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We consider this visit will contribute to the effort to reduce Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt, its spokesman said ahead of the leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US president has repeatedly stated he wants to solve this huge issue before he leaves office.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obama, only the fourth American leader to visit the country since its foundation nearly 200 years ago, heads to Berlin once his 29-hour sojourn in Athens ends on Wednesday. Tsipras is pushing EU partners to agree to a debt deal by the end of the year. At around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac330bn, or 180 percent of GDP, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile is not only regarded as unsustainable but perhaps the biggest impediment to its economic recovery. Without the load being partially forgiven, Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Syriza-dominated government says it will be high-nigh impossible to get out of the death spiral in which the recession-ravaged economy now finds itself. Obama, who also spoke of the importance of reforms in making the Greek economy more competitive, emphasized the significance of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong, prosperous and unified Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not just for the people of Europe but for the whole world and the US.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is the first time a sitting US president has elected to visit Greece on its own. On previous occasions Turkey has also been included in the tour. But Obama, who is accompanied by his Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, is believed to have wanted to make the trip for a long time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a personal choice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the defense minister Panos Kammenos speaking to a local radio station after welcoming the leader at Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 international airport. The symbolism of Athens being the birthplace of democracy also played a significant role for a president now determined to allay the fears of European leaders following the election of his successor Donald Trump last week. At a press conference following 90-minute talks with Obama, the Greek prime minister said it was vital that Greeks began to feel the effects of the sacrifices they have made in recent years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After seven years the Greek people cannot bear any more austerity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece deserves debt relief and the time is now. President Obama and I discussed a number of issues specifically the important potential of investment in Greece and the future of Greece with its shipping power becoming an important centre for trade, transport and energy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the signs of US economic strength question the need for any fiscal stimulus, says Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research: The consumption strength (and the related good performance of the US economy in the second half of 2016) has important policy implications. First, and most straightforward, it allows the Fed to stay on course for a rate hike at the upcoming meeting in mid-December. Second, and probably more controversial, it really questions the need for a massive fiscal stimulus at this point. After all, the idea of such a stimulus is to temporarily support the economy during downturns. There is a growing literature showing that fiscal multipliers are much smaller when the economy is close to potential or full employment. That means that one gets less bang for the buck. Moreover, as highlighted already by Milton Friedman, poorly timed policies add instability to the economy, potentially exacerbating rather than damping business cycles. They initially may cause overheating and higher inflation, and then a deeper recession. The strong US retail sales figures have only added to the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said a hike next month was almost in the bag: Strong US retail sales, and an expectation of further gains in inflation (due out on November 17) make the 92% market probability for a 14 December Fed rate hike look about right (nothing is 100% until it is done). Not only were headline retail sales figures strong at +0.8% month on month, but there were strong core figures (control group which strips out the more volatile items also rose 0.8% month on month). The figures were stronger than the consensus expected (+0.6% month on month), and stronger still when upwards revisions to the previous months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data are taken into account. The strength in sales was also matched with its breadth and only a few sub-categories registered month on month declines (furniture (-0.9% month on month, dept stores -0.7% month on month, and eating/drinking -0.7% month on month). While a December hike looks as close to a done deal as one ever gets in markets, there are still questions about 2017 Fed policy. Markets are currently optimistic about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal expansion in the US next year, and downplaying risks of a more deflationary protectionist policy mix. This might be right. That said, it places most of the risk on the downside, should expansion take longer to materialise than expected, or protectionism rear up more strongly than anticipated. While Mark Carney was delighting MPs by doling out party invitations, the US released better than forecast retail sales figures for October. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.8% last month compared to September, with a particularly strong performance from the car industry. On top of that, building materials were also in demand, perhaps due to households hit by Hurricane Matthew having to rebuild and repair damage. The year on year rise was 4.3%. Analysts had forecast a month on month rise of 0.6% in October. Meanwhile September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised upwards from 0.6% to 1%. The combined gain in September and October was the biggest two month gain since early 2014. Mark Carney was on rather jolly form as he faced MPs today, perhaps happy that the issue of his term length was finally resolved last month. But what did we actually learn? 1) Central Banks are fighting their corner, as TrumpWorld approaches. Carney was repeatedly adamant that central bankers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t responsible for the inequality and low growth that has helped to drive Donald Trump to power, and also helped to cause Brexit. He insisted that broader issues are in play, and only politicians can fight them, saying: I think it is very important to distinguish between the stance of monetary policy and the reasons why global interest rates are low, the reasons why inequality have increased across major economies. The last two are caused by much more fundamental factors and an excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame deflection exercise. Donald Trump argues that his tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans will actually have an effect here, creating the conditions for higher growth and borrowing costs. Carney may be offer his US counterpart, Janet Yellen, a lifeline -- given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer her a second term at the Fed. Central bank independence looks shaky; Carney is reminding us that central bankers have been clearing up quite a mess since 2008. 2) Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be swayed to stay longer We can safely assume now that governor will flying back to Canada in July 2019 to be reunited with his family. Even if Brexit turns into a dogs dinner, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finished by March 2019, Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do more than the extra 12 months he signed up for. There is a practical reality, which is I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be separated from my family for that extra period of extension so there are limits, reasonable limits to what that would be. I will leave June 30th 2019. 3) Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get used to falling inflation Carney was reminded that inflation surprisingly fell this morning, to 0.9%. His message -- don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect prices to remain low in 2017, given the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness. Inflation is going up. The pass through from a 20 percent fall in the trade weighted level of sterling is going to come,it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to build towards the end of this year into 2017 and in our expectation, be above 2 percent by the middle of 2017 and stay there for a while because of that pass through. 4) Businesses are getting the Brexit jitters A Bank survey has found that 45% of Uk firms have seen their investment plans affected by Brexit; half of those companies have put spending plans on ice. And Carney also predicted that financial firms could start triggering their contingency plans when there is 18 months to go until Brexit, if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the look of the new deal. He said: If the time to exit is measured in 18 months or less and the degree of exit is viewed as considerable then a number of those firms would take decisions, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best guidance I can give. 5) The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas Party will be a cracker Jacob Rees-Mogg MP has pushed for Mark Carney to get the sack, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to see that the two men have made up. The governor has invited one of his sternest critics to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swanky Christmas bash, along with the rest of the committee too (chairman Andrew Tyrie is planning to drag along a few officials too, so the Bank had better lay on extra nibbles). Mark Carney ends the meeting by returning to his theme that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blame exercise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underway, with central banks being labelled as the only cause of problems in the economy today. He says that only politicians can really tackle inequality - his job is to help create economic stability and stable inflation. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to run exeptionally loose monetary policy We are going to continually make clear that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the structural changes that will drive productivity. But he agrees it would be absolutely welcome to raise interest rates, when appropriate: And finally, Steve Baker tries to get himself swiftly dis-invited from the Bank of England Christmas party, by asking: Q: Have you lost the plot? MPC member Ian McCafferty denies it -- the bank acted on the best data possible after the Brexit vote, and have been responding to events first. Baker clarifies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually quoting William Hague (former foreign secretary), who recently claimed that central bankers were pumping up a new bubble and keeping rates too low. Q: You have explained that unemployment would be higher if interest rates rise, so aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly political decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? No, Carney insists. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re following our mandate (to maintain inflation around 2% in the medium term). And he then suggests that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dangerous theory that central bankers should thrown down a challenge to elected leaders: I do not accept the line of thought that central banks should not focus on their remit. They should tighten policy in order to force governments to take tough decisions. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s straying from the mandate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political. Q: Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there be a huge crash when rates rise, having been left low for so long? Deputy governor Minouche Shafik argues that the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set the interest rate that the UK economy needs. And there would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big economic costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to pay if rates were raised now. Rees-Mogg asks whether the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest (more optimistic) economic forecasts will affect economic growth, in the same way that Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement immediately after the Brexit vote helped shore up confidence (in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, anyway) Tiptoeing carefully, Carney suggests that forecast changes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as much impact on consumers as actual interest rate changes (or commitments to act). Q: But if your forecasts are wrong, and are revised, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a problem? Carney suggests that all forecasts are revised. Q: Yes, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to spot which part of the August forecast was right [the BoE slashed its 2017 growth forecast, and then revised it much higher in November]. Carney tries to stick to the big picture, saying that Britain is suffering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow motion slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since the Brexit vote, not a sharp adjustment. Q: So should you watch out for groupthink in future? Carney says that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts were too pessimistic about consumer spending; people did not react badly to the Brexit vote. The lesson learned is around the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig turning point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. Finally, Jacob Rees-Mogg gets to question the Bank of England. Rees-Mogg is one of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toughest critics, and recently suggested the governor should resign for his comments before the Brexit vote. Everyone leans forward to hear what zingers Rees-Mogg will send down,.... Q: I must start by thanking you, governor, for inviting me to the Bank of England Christmas Party, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very gracious, so thank you very much. Well, it is the season, grins Carney. Immediately, Steve Baker MP catches the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye - perhaps keen on some canap\u00c3\u00a9s and champers - and Carney finds himself inviting the whole committee along! Mark Carney has challenged politicians to implement \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 structural economic reforms. Otherwise, we could be stuck with low interest rates for decades. Mark Carney says that only 4% of companies with a pension deficit say that current low interest rates are causing a problem. Q: But you at the Bank of England have just boosted the contributions into your own final salary scheme, says Helen Goodman. Carney doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like this very much - he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153total compensation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been level-pegging with the public sector. Back in parliament, Helen Goodman MP challenges the Bank of England over its QE scheme. Q: By pushing down bond yields, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve damaged defined benefit pension schemes and forced them to put more money to cover deficits, Minouche Shafik says this only affects schemes that are already in deficit, and most private sector firms have moved away from offering these final salary schemes. Goodman shoots back that firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopping these schemes because people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the security of final salary pension. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stopping them because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too expensive in the current financial environment. And because people are living longer, Shafik replies. Breaking away from Mark Carney.... over in Greece, president Barack Obama has arrived in Athens. Security is extra right in the Greek capital; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a complete lockdown, with protests banned, public transport stopped, schools closed down,. Some 5,000 local police and over 300 US security agents participating in what is an unprecedented security cordon thrown around the capital. A gun ship is plying the waters south of Athens, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drone flying overhead, says our correspondent Helena Smith. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a full report shortly. In the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the day is playing out: Andrew Tyrie takes Carney back to the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote, and tries to get him to admit that a weak pound is a good thing. Q: Was the fall in the exchange rate welcome? It was necessary, Carney replies. The purchasing power of the currency has gone down by 20%, as part of the process of adjusting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (whopping) current account deficit. (A better option would have been a surge in domestic productivity, of course, to drive up exports, but one can only dream....) Q: OK, but was the scale of the correction welcome? Future events will decide that, says Carney. Tyrie then reads out a quote from former BoE governor Mervyn King, who said recently that the fall in sterling was indeed welcome. Q: Do you welcome this intervention from your predecessor? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m aways keen to hear what Lord King has to say, straight-bats Carney, joking that his intervention was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessary but welcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And he promises to keep a vow of silence once he leaves the BoE in June 2019. Economics professor Tony Yates thinks Carney should have batted questions about the weak pound out of the park: Mark Carney hands out a brief economics lesson, insisting that the relationship between the money supply and inflation is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnon-existant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Some of the MPs look unconvinced; maybe remembering Margaret Thatcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s zeal for monetarism (which encouraged her government to hike interest rates and trigger the deep recession of the early 80s). This theory may have won a Nobel Prize [for Milton Friedman], Carney says, but economics moves on. Carney says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprecise number\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that shows the limit of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tolerance for higher inflation (so no new forward guidance today!). It all depends why inflation is moving - including whether the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation expectations have risen. He says that many retailers took our hedges against a falling pound, to protect them for six or 12 months, and they are trying to cut costs to limit future price rises. Carney says that inflation in October was lower than expected (as we covered this morning) mainly due to short-term effects in the clothing market. But... he insists that inflation is going to rise in the months ahead, as the weaker pound pushes up the price of imported goods. Boom! Mark Carney suggests that City firms could start executing plans to leave London in autumn 2017, if they are disappointed by the early shape of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal. He tells the committee: If the time to exit is measured in 18 months, or less, and the degree of exit is considerable, then a number of firms will take decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDegree of exit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 means hard, or soft Brexit -- ie, whether the financial services sector retains full access and membership of the single market. Q: What steps is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector taking for Brexit? Carney says that firms in the core of the financial sector, such as banks and insurance firms, are making contingency plans. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very few of them are actually implementing contingency plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And he urges business leaders to sit tight. As they follow those plans, hard decisions will be taken. But I would stress, to those firms, that it is very early days. So planning makes sense, action is in general precipitous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our view is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days [for Brexit]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Mark Carney says. Article 50 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been triggered yet, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if there will be a transition period afterwards. Wes Streeting MP takes Mark Carney into the details of Brexit. Carney says that the financial markets have taken a more downbeat view of Brexit than consumers. The scale and direction of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline shows that markets expect slower UK growth and a less open economy. And UK firms are adjusting to Brexit faster than expected in August. Carney says: For a little more than half of UK businesses, this is a non-issue But for 45%, Brexit is having some impact And for half of those fims, it is a notable impact -- they have shelved or delayed investment Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway makes an important point -- until this morning, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that former chancellor George Osborne had asked Mark Carney to serve three more years. John Mann: How can the Bank of England plan for Brexit when no-one knows what it will mean? We certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the eventual shape of Brexit will be, agrees MPC member Michael Saunders. Q: So how can you be doing your job if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not having regular updates from the government, and some indication over where Brexit is going? Carney suggsts there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to panic. This is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all to play for\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve drawn up a central forecast based on the likelihood of events. And we are available for technocratic support to the government, if they need it. Mann then reveals that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polled his constituents about Brexit; most of them want immigration controls to be part of the discussion, but only a small minority want to leave the single market, so.. Q: Surely you should be providing expert analysis of these options, and keeping us informed? The proper role for the MPC is to make its forecasts, and identify material risks to that forecasts, Carney replies. John Mann MP now challenges Mark Carney over the composition of his monetary policy committee. Q: Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a trade union economist being some much-needed industry experience, to help the Bank understand the economy. Carney says its not up to him to advise the government about MPC appointments. But he did meet with the TUC recently, so the Bank isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ignoring trade unions. Andrew Tyrie jabs at Carney, suggesting he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uttering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDelphic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 words over forward guidance. The guidance is that there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any guidance, right? Yes, says Carney. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that a future Monetary Policy Committee could find themselves in a place where they might need forward guidance. (so the forward guidance is that there might be forward guidance one day) Conservative MP Kit Malthouse asks Mark Carney to explain the position with forward guidance (the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous policy of pledging not to raise interest rates until the economy has reached a certain point). Carney gives a long explanation of forward guidance (which began by not promising to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%). He says these pledges helped to underpin confidence and support the economy. But where is this forward guidance now, pleads Malthouse? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very clear, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that difficult, says Carney (showing a small flash of impatience as he flicks through the latest quarterly inflation report). Look, it says here at the front that we now have a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral stance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on interest rates. In other words, the next interest rate rise could be up or down. Malthouse still looks a bit baffled - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really his fault. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy is now to raise, or lower, rates depending on what the economy needs - which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly rocket science. Tyrie mischievously turns Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention over the Atlantic, suggesting that Donald Trump and Theresa May share the same concerns over central banks. Q: Trump has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty critical of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t he? The president elect has voiced some views on central banks, Mark Carney replies. But the issues facing the Fed and the Bank of England are different, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a straight comparison. And Carney then lets rip at critics who blame central bankers for everything: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important to distinguish between the stance of monetary policy and the reasons why global interest rates are low, the reasons why inequality has increased across major economics. Those are caused by much more fundamental factors. And an excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame deflection exercise. Q: Do you think that the fact that central banks are responsible for such a huge range of activities today puts you in a position where you are more vulnerable to criticism, such as over Brexit? Carney plays this ball safely. He says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely appropriate and natural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that central banks face more accountability today, as they have much wider responsibilities than in the past. Especially when monetary policy is playing such a big role in stimulating economies. Q: Did Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent criticism of central banks in her recent conference speech influence your decision to only serve another 12 months? No, Carney replies. Mark Carney denies that the uncertainty over his departure date has created uncertainty. There are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far bigger issues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the UK economy, and the global economy, than my term lengths, he says. There may be, concedes Andrew Tyrie. There are, Carney insists! Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grilling at the Treasury Committee is underway. Chairman Andrew Tyrie asks the Bank of England governor how much uncertainty has been caused by his decision to initially only serve five years, and then extend it by 12 months. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to keep governors to fixed terms of eight years? Carney says it is a great privilege and a great responsibility to serve at the Bank of England. He had planned to only do a five year term, but was then asked to do an extra three years. Q: So you were asked to extend it to eight years, but only chose to add on 12 months? Yes, says Carney. Q: What happens if the process of triggering article 50 takes longer than expected, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete by the end of June 2019 (when Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-year term ends)? I have a family, Carney explains, and there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable limits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to how long he can be separated from them (the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Diane and their four daughters plan to return to Canada in 2018). Carney says he added one year to his term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of a sense of responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Theresa May has made it clear that she plans to trigger article 50 by March 2017, he says, so Britain should have left the EU by March 2019. But he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate about hypothetical scenarios, and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want his departure date to be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjudgement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the Brexit timetable. Tyrie won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this lie, demanding to know.... Q: Are you definitely, irrevocably, leaving the bank in 2019? It sounds like you want to get rid of me, jokes Carney. And then he insists that he will indeed leave the BoE on 30 June 2019. While we wait for Mr Carney, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to flag up that UK house prices rose by 7.7% in the 12 months to September. That matches August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading, with houses in the south of England driving the market up. Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, says there are signs that the market may be cooling.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We now have three months of post-Brexit official housing figures, which show price growth remaining robust, but fewer properties changing hands. At the start of the year, we expected slower house price growth, but in fact it has shown impressive resilience: in the first three quarters of the year average annual house prices were up by around 8% across the UK compared to the same period last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But high prices are causing some buyers to stay out of the market altogether. The ONS data show residential transactions in September were just 93,000, 11.3% lower than the previous year. This implies that underlying demand may be weakening as property becomes less and less affordable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due to give evidence to the Treasury Committee in parliament now, on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest quarterly inflation report. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a livefeed here. Newsflash from Brussels: the eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of this year, matching Q2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate. Although Germany and France only grew by 0.2%, Italy expanded by 0.3% and the Netherlands and Spain both posted healthy growth of 0.7%. A string of economist are predicting that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate will keep rising in the months ahead, despite dropping to 0.9% in October. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The expected rise in inflation paused for breath today as higher fuel prices were offset by slower rises in the price of clothes and university fees and cheaper hotel stays. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against all expectations, the CPI rose by just 0.9% in the year to October, slightly lower than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1% increase. However prices are still rising faster than at any time since late 2014. The rise in prices continue to be driven by sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent weakness which has raised the cost of imported fuel and food. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers can expect UK inflation to continue rising into next year as the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide continues to be felt. The conventional wisdom is that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% inflation target will be left behind in 2017. Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency exchange firm predicts sharp prices rises in 2017: In our estimates it will be the early part of the New Year that sees the majority of the price rises. Retailers are some of the smartest companies out there and they know it would be suicide to hike prices now pre-Christmas. Of course, the tightness of budgets in the retail environment means that any price rises are going to be painful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and low cost operators and discounters will be ready to pounce - but they will have to come or we will likely see additional seasonal and structural unemployment increases in 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is concerned by the jump in input prices (see earlier post) While inflation eased last month there is a ticking time bomb in the PPI data, which measures the costs of goods for manufacturers. And here there is a sign that much higher consumer inflation is on its way. The ONS data showed factory gate prices for goods produced by UK manufacturers rose 2.1% in the year to October 2016, which was a sharp jump from the 1.3% in the year to September 2016. Core input prices were up 9.9% in the year to October 2016, versus a rise of 5.1% in the year to September 2016. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away by this inflation slowdown - it will surely only be temporary. The detail of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI rate dipped last month because clothing prices had jumped sharply a year earlier, in October 2015. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbase effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, where last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise drops out of the calculations. The ONS explains: Clothing and footwear: the downward effect came mainly from garments (in particular women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outerwear), for which prices rose by 0.2% between September and October 2016, compared with a larger rise of 2.3% a year earlier. It is important to note that this followed a relatively large increase in prices in September 2016, which resulted in an upward contribution to the change in the rate of a similar magnitude to the downward effect seen in October. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also important to flag up that education hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suddenly become cheaper. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just becoming less expensive at a slower rate. The ONS says: Education: charges, overall, rose by 2.0% between September and October this year compared with a larger rise of 3.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward contribution came principally from UK and EU student tuition fees, where the impact from the rise in the cap for tuition fees (first introduced for new students in England in 2012) was smaller this year than in 2015. This was because nearly all students are already paying the higher rate of fees whereas last year the fees for fourth year courses rose to the higher rates. In addition there were more modest price increases for part-time and postgraduate fees compared with last year. On the other hand, transport costs have certainly pushed up. Motor fuel prices rose by 2.3% between September and October 2016. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers are suffering from a hefty dose of inflation, due to the weak pound. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Producer Prices index spiked by 4.6% in October - the biggest monthly rise on record. UK firms are suffering from the weakness in sterling since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, which is making raw materials and fuel much pricier. At present, retailers appear to be absorbing the cost rather than passing it onto consumers. But with imported goods prices surging, they may not be able to keep shop prices down for much longer.... This chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI rate dipped, after jumping in September: This chart shows how clothing, recreation and educational all pulled inflation back: And this one shows how transport costs, including petrol, have jumped over the last year: The pound is falling sharply, as traders react to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report. Sterling has lost three-quarters of a cent, to $1.241 against the US dollar. They will be calculating that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less chance of an early interest rate rise: The Office for National Statistics says cheaper clothing helped to drive the UK inflation rate down last month, countering a rise in fuel costs. The main downward contributors to the change in the rate were prices for clothing and university tuition fees, which rose by less than they did a year ago, along with falling prices for certain games and toys, overnight hotel stays and non-alcoholic beverages. These downward pressures were offset by rising prices for motor fuels, and by prices for furniture and furnishings, which fell by less than they did a year ago. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen! The consumer prices index only rose by 0.9% in October, new figures show, compared with 1.0% in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise; economists had expected CPI to rise to 1.1%. More to follow.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiona Cincotta of City Index explaining why the bond market rout has taken a break this morning: The turmoil in the bond market appears to be pausing for breath, which is quite typical after the moves we have seen. The global bond market has sold off at an extraordinary rate since Trump won the presidential race 6 days ago and is currently on track for its worst monthly decline since 2003. Debt prices have fallen sharply as investors contemplate a world of higher inflation, increasing interest rate and political uncertainty, however this sell off is now showing signs of slowing. It almost seems ironic that Yellen &amp; co. have been trying to steepen the yield curve for years and yet Trump achieved it in a few days. The challenge is that if this can happen in conjunction with a strengthening economy, if achieved then it could be good news. However, apart from campaign rhetoric we still know very little about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actual plans. The bond markets are calmer this morning, as investors take a breather after several days of falls. Government bond prices have recovered in early trading, pulling yields down from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs. The UK 10-year gilt yield has dropped to 1.39%, from 1.43% last night [yields fall when prices rise] US Treasury bills have also clawed back some ground, having been sold off heavily since Donald Trump won the race to the White House (wiping out $1trn of value). These charts from Bloomberg TV show how yields have dipped this morning, but are much higher than a week ago: Good news from Italy! Its economy has returned to growth, with GDP expanding by 0.3% in the last quarter. That means the Italian economy has beaten expectations - and beaten Germany, whose 0.2% growth rate looks even more sluggish now. On an annual basis, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was 0.9% larger than a year ago -- up from 0.7% in the second quarter. This is a much-needed boost for Matteo Renzi, as the prime minister faces a crunch referendum over constitutional reforms in December. Just in! The Netherlands has beaten Germany, by posting growth of 0.7% in the third quarter of the year: Economists are blaming Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown on the impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. The slump in the pound since June has made German goods less competitive in Britain, and also dented confidence across the global economy. So this would explain why exports fell between July and September, pulling German growth down to 0.2%. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski says the Brexit vote undermined Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic strength: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit meets solid domestic economy. This is probably the best description of the German economic performance during the third quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brzeski is also concerned that president-elect Trump could also hurt global trade: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single most important trading partner, the U.S., really moves towards more protectionism, this would definitely leave its mark on German growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle hopes that German growth will bounce back in the October to December quarter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One had expected a little more economic activity in the third quarter. But the signs for the final quarter are looking good. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are mainly creeping higher this morning: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has jumped by 46 point at the start of trading. Supermarket group Tesco has jumped by 3%, after new data shows sales growing at their fastest rate since 2013: Mining shares are leading the fallers, though, down at least 3%. That follows several days of gains, driven by the prospect of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to rebuild US infrastructure. Jeroen Blokland of Robeco Asset Management is also concerned that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has faltered: Analysts at Citi reckon Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffered from the shock of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak performance may drag down the wider eurozone growth rate, which is published at 10am. Figures released earlier this month suggested euro area GDP expanded by 0.3%, but Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets fears that could be too optimistic. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski: And Holger Zschaepitz of Die Welt shows how Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has slowed through the year. Bad news: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has suffered a surprise slowdown, with growth halving in the last three months as foreign trade waned. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy only expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, figures just released show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 0.4% in April-June, and 0.7% in January-March. Economists had expected German GDP to rise by 0.3% in July to September. Statistics firm Destatis blamed a fall in exports for the slowdown, saying: Foreign trade had a downward effect on growth. Exports were slightly down while imports were slightly up compared with the second quarter of 2016. Household spending drove growth during the quarter. But companies also spent less on new machinery and equipment during the last quarter, although construction output rose. As this charts hows, year-on-year growth also fell sharply to 1.5%, from 3.1% in the second quarter. This means that Germany performed rather weaker than Britain, which grew by 0.5% in the quarter, or the US which expanded by 0.7% (or an annualised rate of 2.9%). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots happening today, both in the financial world and the markets. At 9.30am, we get the latest UK inflation report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show that the cost of living jumped again in October, to 1.1%, up from 1% in September, as the weak pound drive up import costs. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is then due before parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee at 10am. This will be Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first appearance since he agreed to serve an extra year. Expect lots of questions about whether the Bank was too gloomy and alarmist about the Brexit vote, having raised its 2017 growth forecast. We get a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy this morning, with the first estimate of German (7am) and Italian GDP (9am) over the last quarter. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the bond markets closely, after prices fell sharply yesterday as investors anticipate higher inflation and growth once Donald Trump becomes US president. As Larry Elliott explains: Fears about the inflationary potential of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending have sent shock waves through the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond markets, as investors take fright at the prospect of higher than expected interest rates in the years ahead. Central banks are braced to suffer fresh losses on their vast holdings of government debt after the sell-off that saw $1tn wiped off the value of bonds last week intensified on Monday. Bond prices fell for a sixth day running in the UK, pushing the yield on government gilts to their highest level since the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, and US bond yields reached levels last seen in December 2015. Bond yields, the rate of interest an investor gets, rise when bond prices go down. But Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the White House yet (!) Barack Obama is still at the helm, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visiting Greece on his final tour of Europe before his term expires. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to call for Greece to receive debt relief, to give its people fresh hope as their long austerity drive continues. Athens is already under a serious lockdown, with all protests banned while Obama meets with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and President Prokopis Pavlopoulos. And in the corporate world, mobile giant Vodafone, commercial property group Land Securities, budget airline easyJet, food manufacturer Premier Foods and cinema group Cineworld are reporting results.",

Employees currently based in the Glasgow office will likely face involuntary severance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shell signalled earlier this year that more staff could be affected, as it tries to trim costs as rock-bottom oil prices continue to dent profits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision is driven by increasing pressures on our business to reduce cost and generate cash, and reflects the fact that the capability of our other centres has evolved to be able to handle the activities that are currently performed in Glasgow, but at a significantly lower cost,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shell said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand this is very difficult news for employees. During the transition period we are committed to ensuring ongoing regular employee engagement and support.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesperson, Liam McArthur MSP, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This news will be a devastating blow to those directly affected and their families. We cannot afford to lose these skills and every effort must be made to provide training and advice to give workers the best chance to secure new roles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also important that Scottish and UK governments look again at the tax regime and take urgent action to stop decommissioning contracts floating away from Scotland to our international competitors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP, said Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The movement of jobs abroad is a challenging issue and it is as important as ever that both the UK and Scottish governments work together to ensure that things pick up in the future. The only silver lining to this story is that the announcement has been made over a year ahead of most employees leaving the company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would urge the Scottish government therefore to use this time, along with its agencies, to make sure the process of redundancy is made as comfortable as possible for the workers and their families.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Glasgow office is part of a division that manages financial reporting, corporate governance risk and travel and expenditure.",

But the pound held firm against the euro although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/showArticlePage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;object_id=9865022&amp;rev_id=1&amp;elqTrackId=73388d9285554dad95048fb0523f625b&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. <a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;entityId=107135&amp;elqTrackId=cd1e11bd9f4640f3ab243fd182183f9c&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Italy</a> is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p> <p>Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. </p> <p>The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582c7bc7e4b090fc812818b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:48:14.506Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil volatile after stocks reports and Russian comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after </strong><strong>more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering.</strong></p> <p>After the American Petroleum Institute reported <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf#block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf\">a higher than expected stock build </a></strong>last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase.</p> <p>Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose.</p> <p>But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month.</p> <p>So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:48:41.716Z\">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582c75d1e4b06ac41294e374\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:12:39.054Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany's Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble dismisses Greek debt relief talk</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US president Barack Obama might be pushing for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b#block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b\">debt relief for Greece</a></strong>, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting).

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street falling back after several days of rises, investors were pausing for breath a week after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock victory in the US election. The mixed picture from the UK employment data - jobless rate down, claimant count up - added to the uncertainty. But the pound held firm against the euro although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar. The US currency was boosted by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise interest rates next month, as well as the continuing expectation of a Trump spending boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The mood across most equity markets remains subdued, with modest losses being posted. Investors are evidently still cautious about the new [American] administration, with the steady drip of news relating to appointments and the like keeping the market in check. About the only thing still surging is the US dollar. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 43.02 points or 0.63% at 6749.72 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.66% to 10,663.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.78% at 4501.14 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 16,559.84 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.56% lower at 8638.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.44% to 592.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 73 points or 0.39%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum next month, there is some unwelcome analysis from S&amp;P, which paints a fairly uninspiring picture of the prospects for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. It said: The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. Italy is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering. After the American Petroleum Institute reported a higher than expected stock build last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration. The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase. Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose. But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month. So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17. US president Barack Obama might be pushing for debt relief for Greece, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting). Reuters reports: Germany on Wednesday opposed calls for debt relief for Greece after U.S. President Barack Obama offered support for such a mechanism for the recession-hit euro zone state during a trip to Athens. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble said late on Tuesday granting Greece debt relief would do it a disservice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whoever says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe will relieve your debts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is doing Greece a disservice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the finance ministry confirmed Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble as saying after the Passauer Neue Presse daily reported it. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were not made directly in response to Obama, a finance ministry spokesman added. Athens signed up to a third economic bailout package of up to 86 billion euros last year but wants long-term debt restructuring to exit its crisis. Germany, which has long said there is no immediate need for debt relief for Greece as it would discourage much-needed structural reforms, said it noted the comments from Obama, who flies to Berlin later on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have noted that President Obama has pointed to the importance of debt relief. The euro group agreed in May on a timetable on exactly that subject .. regarding measures for the short term, and later in 2018 for mid-term measures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said government spokesman Steffen Seibert at a news conference. In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018 but left key details to be decided later in a compromise between Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough stance and the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for decisions immediately. A finance ministry spokesman said there was nothing new to say. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our position is unchanged. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit has not changed anything,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said at the government news conference. The prospect of higher US interest rates has brought an end to the rally which has seen leading US shares hit new heights. After rising for seven straight trading sessions in the run up and aftermath of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock US presidential election victory, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.25% while Nasdaq was 0.4% lower. Back with the UK, and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jon Cunliffe has said recent currency movements had made setting interest rates move difficult. Reuters reports: Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union has made it harder to set monetary policy, BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Wednesday. Cunliffe said he fully backed the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neutral stance regarding its next move in interest rates, as announced earlier this month, and its latest quarterly set of forecasts which see a modest slowdown next year. The British economy probably still needed interest rates to be negative in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or inflation-adjusted terms, but the fall in sterling meant the BoE would not necessarily be able to stick to this, Cunliffe said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the University of Manchester. US industrial production figures have come in slightly worse than expected. It was unchanged in October compared to forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The September figure was revised down from a 0.1% rise to a 0.2% fall. On his final day in Greece, US president Barack Obama repeated his belief that debt relief was vital for the country. The Athens News Agency - Macedonian Press Agency reports: Speaking at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation on Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama once again highlighted the need for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to agree to debt relief, in accordance with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noting that the country, and especially its young people, needed to see hope and a future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are to be sustained, people here need to see hope and they need to see progress.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Young people, in particular, needed to know there is a future, there is an education, and jobs that were worthy of their potential, he added. Obama also had time for a tour of the Acropolis: And then it was off. Next stop: Berlin. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IHS Markit on the UK employment data: Over in Europe, and the latest on the draft budgets put forward by member states. Reuters reports: Italy and five other countries are at risk of breaking European Union budget discipline rules with their 2017 draft budgets, the European Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. The five other countries are Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia and Finland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Draft Budgetary Plans of these Member States might result in a significant deviation from the adjustment paths toward the respective medium-term objective,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Commission said. The medium-term objective is a budget balanced in structural terms, which means excluding one-off spending and revenue and the effects of the business cycle. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and economic cycle swings in income and spending, has been rising every year since 2014 and is to jump to 2.2 percent in 2017 from 1.6 percent in 2016 and then further to 2.4 percent in 2018, according to Commission forecasts last week. This goes clearly against EU rules which say that countries have to cut their structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until they reach balance or surplus. Italy says the higher structural deficit is due to extraordinary spending on migration and post-earthquake reconstruction. But the structural deficit indicator does not take into account such one-off items and the Commission called the explanation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not constructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Wednesday, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici sounded more accommodating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant part of the deviation is due to the cost of the seismic activity in the country, very serious this year and to migration inflows,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici told a news conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will take that into account,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed dip came after an early gain in the immediate aftermath of the UK unemployment figures. Chris Saint, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, said: Sterling has drifted lower against the euro and US dollar during European trading hours this morning, finding itself back around the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16 and US$1.24 levels by midday. There was some tentative support for the pound after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour market figures, but the gains were short-lived...On the face of it the headline numbers suggest the jobs market has remained buoyant in the first few months since the EU referendum, although the data probably does little to alter the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future policy path at this stage as pay growth is still relatively contained. The stronger dollar has helped send the oil price lower, after a surge in crude on Tuesday. Talk of an informal meeting on Friday in Doha between oil producers to prepare plans for an output agreement later this month had sent crude soaring around 5% on Tuesday. But the dollar strength, along with news from the American Petroleum Institute that US crude stocks jumped by 3.6m barrels last week rather than showing the expected 1.5m rise, has send crude slipping lower again. Brent is down 1.13% at $46.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 1.2% lower at $45.23. The dollar continues to strengthen as the odds of a US interest rate rise next month continue to shorten. Federal Reserve board member James Bullard is the latest to back an increase, saying that unless there are any major shocks, rates will be hiked. Given how the market has reacted to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected victory in the US election, it is hard to know what major shock would upset the market at this point. But Bullard, who was in London as a UBS banking conference, added that a single rate rise might be enough to move monetary policy to a neutral setting. So the dollar index - against a basket of currencies - has hit a 14 year high of 100.52, while the pound is down 0.17% to $1.2431. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said: The strength in the dollar index does represent a risk for the emerging markets and it can also eat into corporate profit for the US firms. The current move is also massively backed by bets that the Fed is going to raise the interest rate and odds are standing at 94%. It is important to keep in mind that come in December, it is the tone of the Fed for the future trajectory of the interest rate hike which is going to impact the dollar. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the figures: All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market performed in the first three months after the EU referendum. Unemployment has continued to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome. That said, the tone of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement will be that big challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National Statistics. UK unemployment falls to 11-year low Read more One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those who have dropped out of the workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the latest quarter. Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of unemployment in October. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the UK jobs data. Phillip Inman writes: Unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employers have largely shrugged off the June Brexit vote. In the first health check of the labour market covering the three months since the referendum, official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the lowest since September 2005 and down from 4.9% in August and 5.3% a year earlier. Employment remained at a record high of 74.5% and annual wages rises, excluding bonuses, also nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. But the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had slowed dramatically. The full story is here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of self-employed workers has swelled by over 4.5% in the last 12 months, which is a concern given recent revelations about life in the Gig economy. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows that the self-employment total jumped by 213,000 in the last 12 months to 4.79 million, or 15.1% of all workers. In contrast, the number of employees rose by 256,000 to 26.82 million. These self-employed workers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy the benefits of employed workers, such as sickness and holiday pay and the minimum wage -- as was highlighted by protests by Deliveroo drivers and the successful court case brought by two Uber drivers. And figures released last month show that self-employed people are actually receiving less than 15 years ago [their pay is not included in the earnings figures]. The government has asked Matthew Taylor, a former top advisor to Tony Blair, to investigate the whole issue. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says Britain simply hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kept pace with the rise in self-employment. These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the social security system, such as on maternity pay. FSB is pleased with the announcement of the Taylor Review and we are looking forward to inputting into this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in parliament, Theresa May has hailed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures, at Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions. May argues: The unemployment figures show the strength of the fundamental of our economy The employment rate has never been higher, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest in a decade. May also reminded the Commons that search giant Google has just announced it will create 3,000 new jobs, as it builds a new HQ in Kings Cross. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage: Several economists are concerned that British pay packets will be gnawed by inflation next year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows that total pay rose by 2.3% over the last year, unchanged on a month earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than inflation, which fell to 0.9% in October. But inflation is likely to jump to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest forecasts, which would erode earnings growth. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that bosses won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to provide inflation-busting pay rises: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Annual pay growth remained at 2.3% on a three-month average basis, suggesting that workers are in a weak position to offset what is likely to be a sizeable rise in inflation over the next year. Indeed, the capacity of employers to pay more will not be supported by continued weak productivity growth. Overall, prospects of the labour market taking a turn for the worse in the not-too distant future are looking more likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is also worried that real pay growth is stalling, as inflation picks up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real pay growth is the slowest it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been since early 2015. Wages are not growing fast enough to withstand the rise in inflation expected next year. Without swift action from the government, working people could soon by paying the price for Brexit with another fall in living standards. The jobless rate in Wales has inched up to 4.4%, from 4.3% a month ago, due to a 3,000 increase in unemployment. But more encouragingly, 19,000 more people were in work than three months earlier. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones argues that the principality is outperforming the rest of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Year on year, Wales has outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to improvements in employment, unemployment and economic inactivity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment in Wales, at 4.4%, is lower than in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland and remains well below the UK average. Meanwhile the employment rate remains close to its record high, with 41,000 more people in work across Wales than at this same time last year. Unemployment amongst 18 to 24 year-olds in Wales is down 9.1% on the year and there are also 19,000 fewer people economically inactive than a year ago. This graph, from the BBC, shows how Wales jobless rate dipped to just 4.1% over the summer: Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at The Work Foundation, has delved into the labour market report to find some interesting details: The labour market statistics indicate that the labour market remains remarkably stable. The rolling three month measure of unemployment shows a fall of some 37,000 over the most recent quarter, with the rate of unemployment now at 4.8%. The unemployment fall has been widely distributed across the country, though there were increases in both the North West and the East. For the UK as a whole, both full-time and part-time employee numbers increased by 31000. The large gains in employment have all been in the service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably in the retail, hospitality and professional/scientific/technical areas. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector has continued to shrink, to its smallest size in at least 17 years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that there were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector in June, 13,000 fewer than in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, also fears that unemployment will rise in 2017, even though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit shock yet: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, and we could yet see a modest rise in the jobless total next year as uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations dampens business investment and slows overall economic growth. But we do not expect the UK economy to go into recession, so would not expect any large increases in unemployment. Several City experts are concerned that the number of Britons signing on for unemployment benefit jumped by almost 10,000 last month. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcearly warning sign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of problems ahead. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that UK unemployment will rise in the next few months: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market continues to surprise with its resilience to the Brexit shock. The unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a new 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to September. This is yet more evidence that the labour market and the wider economy have fared better than expected since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. However, there could be storm clouds gathering on the horizon. The claimant count \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which in a quirk of the data is a more recent figure than the unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jumped by 9,800 in October, with September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised upwards from 700 to 5,600. All in all, it does seem likely that unemployment could tick up somewhat during the coming months, though dire predictions made in the immediate aftermath of the vote appear wide of the mark. David Cheetham of trading firm XTB.com is also concerned: The rise in the claimant count change - which is a fairer representation of the current environment as this data point covers the period until the end of last month - takes the shine off the good news at the very least and possibly even usurps it. In rising to 9.8k, this indicator came in at its highest level since November 2012 and when you also consider the upward revision of the prior print (to 5.6k from 0.7k) this could be taken as a warning sign that everything may not be quite as rosy as it appears for the labour market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ONS statistician David Freeman has sounded an important note of caution. He points out that employment growth is slowing; just 49,000 people found work in the July-September quarter, which is the slowest rate since March. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment is at its lowest for more than ten years, and the employment rate remains at a record high. Nonetheless, there are signs that the labour market might be cooling, with employment growth slowing. Freedman also points out that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign that the Brexit vote has cut the number of EU workers in Britain: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe Labour Force Survey also includes information on the nationality and country of birth of workers. That limited evidence suggests the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force. As this chart shows, the number of workers from other EU countries in Britain rose by 221,000 in the last year, to 2.26m, while the number of nationals from non-EU nations rose by 20,000 to 1.23 million. Employment minister Damian Hinds has hailed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate since July to September 2005. Hinds says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet again we have a strong set of figures, with employment continuing to run at a record high and unemployment falling to an 11-year low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK labour market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The measures we have taken have put our economy in a position of strength, and we will work to ensure more people can benefit from these opportunities as we build a country that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report shows that the number of people in work rose in the last quarter, and the number of people out of work fell. That kept the employment rate at a record high, but There were 31.80 million people in work, 49,000 more than for April to June 2016 and 461,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 23.24 million people working full-time, 350,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.56 million people working part-time, 110,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate was 74.5%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.60 million unemployed people, 37,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 146,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 4.8%, down from 5.3% for a year earlier and the lowest since July to September 2005. There were 803,300 people claiming unemployment-related benefits in October, up from 793,00 in September. Both men and women benefitted from the drop in unemployment, as this chart shows: There are now 876,000 men classed as unemployed men, 15,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 82,000 fewer than for a year earlier. And there are 728,000 unemployed women, 22,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 64,000 fewer than for a year earlier. We have a small, and welcome, rise in average earnings too. Average pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.4% annually in the July-September quarter, up from 2.3%. But pay including bonuses rose by 2.3%, matching last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. The number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has jumped, by much more than economists expected. The claimant count rose by 9,800 in October, the ONS reports. And September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number has been revised up too; 5,600 people signed on for benefits, not the 700 first reported. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8% in the three months to September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new 11-year low, down from 4.9% a month earlier. More to follow... Barratt Development have sent a shiver through the UK property market this morning by revealing it has cut the price of some high-end London properties, worth over \u00c2\u00a31m. Barratt CEO David Thomas told shareholders that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market conditions in London at higher selling prices remain more challenging. To mitigate these risks we have taken pricing action on a number of our sites in London.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas explains that prices have been cut by 5% to 10% on a few of its most expensive, centrally located London sites in zones one and two. The company has 385 sites in the UK, about 20 of which are in London, with six or seven classed as higher-end in the capital. The wider market, though, is still performing well since the Brexit vote, Barratt said, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer demand is strong supported by good mortgage availability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed; Barratt shares have fallen over 2% this morning, with rival builders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey shedding over 1%. One of the big threats facing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is the risk that City banks start to shift operations across to Europe, following the EU referendum. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging that Swiss bank UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t poised to flee London. Chairman Axel Weber told a conference this morning that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not planning to change anything any time soon and we will wait and see where the dust settles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weber (who used to run Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank) also predicted that the Brexit process will be volatile, with the key decisions only made at the climax of negotiations. Over in Athens, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting ready to welcome US president Barack Obama to the historic Acropolis site - by imposing a massive security clampdown in the area. Obama will then give a speech to the Greek people, which will probably cover Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration crisis, and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own financial crisis. Last night, there were clashes in Athens as groups of protestors demonstrated against Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit: Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is getting an early morning drubbing, down almost 5%. The online supermarket is suffering because Morrisons have just announced a new deal with Amazon, to deliver shopping to its Prime customers within two hours (in parts of London and Hertfordshire anyway). Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares jumped over 1% at the open, with ETX analyst Neil Wilson calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential game-changing tie-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pure profit for the supermarket - the scheme is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capital light\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and will contribute to a \u00c2\u00a350m-\u00c2\u00a3100m incremental profit opportunity outlined in the 2015/16 preliminary results. This is a big money-spinner for Morrisons and gives it a massive edge over Tesco and Sainsbury in the home delivery market. With prices being slashed and competition fierce, this is the kind of deal that will make a big difference to the bottom line. Retail analyst Mark Brumby says the service could be another blow to Ocado (which also has a delivery deal with Morrisons). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no drama in the financial markets this morning. The pound is bobbing around the $1.247 mark this morning, up a measly 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 index has dipped by just 7 points to 6785. Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting for the jobs report at 9.30am, says Conner Campbell of Spreadex, even though it may not be too dramatic Both the unemployment rate and wage growth readings are forecast to remain unchanged at 2.3% (though it could creep a bit higher to 2.4%) and 4.9% respectively; the jobless claims figure, on the other hand, is set to see a bit more movement, rising to 1,900 from the 700 seen the month previous. RBC Capital Markets believe Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate may have actually fallen in the July-September quarter to 4.8%, a new 11-year low. That would cause much celebration on Downing Street, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that next year won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be tough, RBC say: The unemployment rate could actually fall this month to 4.8% from 4.9%. The headline rate is the average of the last three single-month estimates and with the last two months both printing at 4.7% it looks highly likely that we see a tick down by one-tenth. This does though feel more like a short-term quirk than reflective of the outlook where a more challenging macroeconomic outlook in 2017 should put some modest upward pressure on unemployment. Accordingly our expectation for the range of employment gains over the last three months is 60-100k as a central case. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect many fireworks at 9.30am, though, predicting that: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for unemployment and wage growth both to be pretty unchanged, which wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any obvious support for the pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has been surprisingly resilient to the shock of the EU referendum, with the unemployment rate remaining low but wage growth somewhat modest. So the big news this morning should be the latest jobs report, due at 9.30am. It will show if this trend continued into the Autumn, or if there are signs that Brexit is now hurting Economists predict that the unemployment rate remained at 4.9% in the three months to September. That would match last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11-year low, and reassure the City about the state of the UK economy. The more timely claimant count report is expected to show that 2,000 more people signed on for unemployment benefit in October; any rise might indicate that firms are starting to cut jobs. But the real story could come in the earnings figures. Average wages over the last year may have risen by 2.4% (both including and excluding bonuses), up from 2.3%. We saw yesterday that inflation has dipped to 0.9%, but economists still expect it to rise over 2% in 2017. If wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace, households face another real wage squeeze soon. Also coming up.... Barack Obama is due to give a speech in Athens, and tour the Acropolis, as his final tour of Europe continues. Yesterday, the outgoing US president put more pressure on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to offer meaningful debt relief -- an issue which may not be top of his successor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. And in the corporate world, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from housebuilder Barratt, engine-maker Rolls-Royce, commercial property firm British Land and City broker ICAP.",

Aside from a slight rise in US Treasury yields we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen little major effect on financial markets after Janet Yellen said interest rates could rise soon.</p> <p>The fact is a December rate hike has already been priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c markets think there is a roughly 90% chance the Fed will increase the target federal funds rate. It now looks almost impossible for the Fed not to raise rates next month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s painted itself in a corner and has to respond with a hike or all hell will break loose in the markets. </p> <p>[Jobless numbers] only strengthens the case for the Fed to act. Rising bond yields since Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win further add to the argument for the central bank to raise rates. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582dc049e4b06ac41294ea3c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T14:43:02.765Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US inflation rises and jobless claims fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Janet Yellen starting her testimony to Congress <strong><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20161117a.htm\">[full text here]</a></strong>, there has been a spate of US data, none of which makes a rate rise in December less likely.</p> <p>The consumer price index rose 0.4% month on month in October, and 1.6% year on year, both in line with expectations. Economist James Smith at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US inflation is not a massive concern for the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee . That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the upshot of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI report, which showed that the headline continued to rise (to 1.6% YoY) and continues to converge on the core rate (now 2.1%) as the effect of earlier oil price weakness filters out. In fact, the transport component made the first positive contribution to the 12-month rate of inflation since 2014. </p> <p>As this energy drag disappears, we expect the headline rate to hit the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target in the second quarter of next year. If there is one criticism of the overall inflation picture, it is that price gains are not especially broad-based...</p> <p>But that aside, inflation is certainly not a hindrance to a December hike, nor indeed should it be a massive drag on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for 2017. We may get some further insight from Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony this afternoon. A central part of the discussion both today and amongst Fed officials over coming months will instead revolve around the neutral rate. In her introductory remarks today, Yellen suggested that the Fed funds rate is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only somewhat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd below the neutral rate and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk of falling behind the curve seems limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Indeed, many governments also responded with austerity in the Depression, the last time that western economies fell into a liquidity trap.</p> <p> Explanations for the popularity of austerity at the zero lower bound include that recessions are opportunities for those calling for a smaller state to trim public expenditure. They can blame the recession on lax fiscal policy during the boom years. Households, particularly those with the median voters, are sympathetic to the argument that the government must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tighten its belt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the same time as they do. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So if austerity drags an economy into a liquidity trap, policymakers may be forced to consider unconventional methods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/helicopter-money-back-in-the-air\">such as helicopter money -- under which a central bank creates new money to fund an expansionary fiscal policy</a>.</strong></p> <p>This is a controversial issue in economics - and this paper explains how this could happen:</p> <p><strong>The first principle is that the central bank should shape the broad outlines of the coordination.</strong> Not only does the central bank have macro-economic expertise which is vital if the coordination is to work, its leadership of the process is crucial to avoiding fiscal dominance. The central bank should be in charge of both initiating and ending the monetary-fiscal coordination process. To minimise political pressures on the central bank, the coordination process also needs to be clearly defined at the outset. In the event of helicopter drops, for example, the central bank needs to outline triggers for stopping them, such as an inflation knockout. This will protect the operational independence of core monetary policy, thereby anchoring inflation expectations.</p> <p><strong>The second principle is that any coordination mechanism must maintain political control over fiscal policy.</strong> So although the central bank can propose the outlines of a coordination plan, the government can refuse to participate. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the coordinating mechanism must distinguish between the stance and the content of fiscal policy. So while the central bank might call for looser fiscal policy, it should not comment on the composition of this loosening. Admittedly, the content of fiscal policy affects its macro-economic impact. Nonetheless, given the political dangers of commenting on individual fiscal items, and the democratic argument for the government to retain discretion over different tax and spending components, any coordination mechanism should limit itself to the fiscal stance.</p> <p><strong>The third principle is that monetary-fiscal coordination should be strictly limited to the zero lower bound. </strong>Even if a coordination mechanism effectively protects central bank independence and preserves democratic control over fiscal policy, entering the realm of fiscal policy still presents considerable threats to central bank independence. The prospect of central bankers routinely commenting on fiscal policy may undermine political support for central bank independence or may open up the central bank to reciprocal criticism over monetary policy from the government. By limiting such coordination to only when it is most effective, these risks can be minimised. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67885044574c255d71b1ab3bfc49a15bad73638f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67885044574c255d71b1ab3bfc49a15bad73638f/0_0_650_233/500.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"179\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T11:57:25.910Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582d8fe4e4b03207800c2f00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T11:24:06.155Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for my prediction that Ed Balls wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to perform any dance moves on the radio....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/799205762107117568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yes, this is a video of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edballs\">@edballs</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcstrictly\">@bbcstrictly</a> fame teaching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnickrobinson\">@bbcnickrobinson</a> Gangnam style during the eight o&#39;clock news <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/r4today?src=hash\">#r4today</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yptk5Qf1uj\">pic.twitter.com/yptk5Qf1uj</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/799205762107117568\">November 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582d8d60e4b06ac41294e8c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-17T11:22:54.314Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ed Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 research on central banks is getting some attention this morning, thanks to the Strictly effect.</strong></p> <p>Political journalist Iain Martin reckons Balls made a good argument on the Today Programme this morning (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/17/ed-balls-bank-of-england-independence-bank-reforms-retail-sales-janet-yellen-business-live?page=with:block-582d6adae4b06ac41294e7fe#block-582d6adae4b06ac41294e7fe\">highlights are here</a>)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/799161933014437889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Another storming performance from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edballs\">@edballs</a>  - calls for more political accountability for BoE.

                "bodyText":"There was still a note of caution around, understandably given the ructions of recent weeks, but investors still managed to push most European markets higher. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was boosted by better than expected retail sales figures, but Italy underperformed amid worries about its forthcoming referendum on constitutional reform. The banking sector in Italy was under particular pressure again. In the US, markets took Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in their stride, with the Fed chair hinting that a rate rise was likely next month. Disappointing results from Wal-Mart helped limit any gains, however. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: A rapid rise in retail sales in October helped UK stocks gain ground on Thursday despite poorly-received results from Royal Mail. There was a more mixed performance in European shares, with German and Italian indices weighed down by the banking sector. US markets opened mostly higher, though disappointing Walmart results dragged the Dow Jones [down]. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 44.99 points or 0.67% at 6794.71 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.2% to 10,685.54 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.59% to 4527.77 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.03% to 16,555.31 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.92% at 8718.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.49% to 601.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 8 points or 0.04%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. If you want to listen to Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony again, it can be replayed here. Janet Yellen, in both her prepared remarks and subsequent comments to Congress, strongly suggested an interest rate rise was on the cards in December, as most economists now expect. She said the economy had strengthened since the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting and inflation was moving up. But she admitted the aftermath of the US election had caused uncertainty, and the Fed would have to take this into account. And, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticisms that the Fed was making decisons for political purposes, she defended the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. Despite talk in the immediate wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory that she might resign, she stated clearly she wanted to serve her full term until January 2018. Much discussion of the lack of wage growth and how to tackle it, and how to help people who are not benefitting from the growth in the economy. And some comments about how low interest rates mean companies are more likely to do share buybacks than invest. Yellen says its not clear to her why investment spending has been weak, but denies the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low interest rate policy is part of the problem. And with profuse thanks for Yellen for turning up, the session ends. Questioning turns to cybersecurity and what steps Fed has taken to address the risks. Yellen says cybersecurity is one of most significant risks the country faces, and the Fed is working with others to make sure there is a system to deal with them. Have to make sure controls financial institutions have in place are sufficient. We are proposing highest standards firms [of systemic importance] should meet. And it is a broad threat and Fed cannot deal with it alone. She says that in every country that has suffered hyperinflation, it was because central banks had to compromise their independence. Yellen defends the independence of central banks (a hot topic at the moment). She says Congress establishes the goals for monetary policy, but it is critical the central bank can make independent decisions to pursue those goals without interference while being accountable and transparent. They need to be able to not think about the short term, and sometimes they need to do unpopular things. Yellen is asked about the Dodd Frank, the legislation brought in to regulate financial institutions after the financial crisis, which Donald Trump has talked about repealing. Yellen says she would not want to turn back the clock, and would not want all the improvements under Dodd Frank eliminated. More on the aftermath of the election. Yellen says that markets are anticipating fiscal policy will be expansionary, and this could have inflationary consequences. But she adds that there is still much uncertainty about future policies. She says, we will watch what decisions are made and factor them into our calculations. Question: Does lack of informantion mean it would be better to delay any rate rise until January. [I believe] uncertainty about these matters will last for some considerable time. We have said gradual increases in rates are likely, near term risks do seem reasonably balanced. The judgement the [Fed] committee reached in November is appropriate one. Can you envisage any circumstances you would not serve out your full term? Yellen: No I cannot...I fully intend to serve out my term [which ends in January 2018. [As a reminder, Donald Trump had been critical of Yellen and there had been some talk she might resign if he won the election] Now for questions. Does the election result effect the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on raising rates? Yellen: My own judgement is looking at economic data thus far, the evidence since we met in November is consistent with the expectation of strengthening growth, inflation moving up. [There will be] many economic policies which Congress and the administration will consider in the months to come. When there is greater clarity, the committee will have to factor [that into] their assessments , and perhaps adjust the outlook depending what happens. Yellen has begun her testimony (which as a reminder is available here). As the introductions begin at Congress ahead of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, analysts continue to suggest a rate rise in December is pretty much nailed on. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: Roll on December. Aside from a slight rise in US Treasury yields we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen little major effect on financial markets after Janet Yellen said interest rates could rise soon. The fact is a December rate hike has already been priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c markets think there is a roughly 90% chance the Fed will increase the target federal funds rate. It now looks almost impossible for the Fed not to raise rates next month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s painted itself in a corner and has to respond with a hike or all hell will break loose in the markets. [Jobless numbers] only strengthens the case for the Fed to act. Rising bond yields since Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win further add to the argument for the central bank to raise rates. Ahead of Janet Yellen starting her testimony to Congress [full text here], there has been a spate of US data, none of which makes a rate rise in December less likely. The consumer price index rose 0.4% month on month in October, and 1.6% year on year, both in line with expectations. Economist James Smith at ING Bank said: US inflation is not a massive concern for the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee . That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the upshot of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI report, which showed that the headline continued to rise (to 1.6% YoY) and continues to converge on the core rate (now 2.1%) as the effect of earlier oil price weakness filters out. In fact, the transport component made the first positive contribution to the 12-month rate of inflation since 2014. As this energy drag disappears, we expect the headline rate to hit the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target in the second quarter of next year. If there is one criticism of the overall inflation picture, it is that price gains are not especially broad-based... But that aside, inflation is certainly not a hindrance to a December hike, nor indeed should it be a massive drag on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for 2017. We may get some further insight from Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony this afternoon. A central part of the discussion both today and amongst Fed officials over coming months will instead revolve around the neutral rate. In her introductory remarks today, Yellen suggested that the Fed funds rate is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only somewhat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd below the neutral rate and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk of falling behind the curve seems limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This indicates that the pace of hikes could continue to be slow next year, although this will of course depend on some of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans. But until the details of these plans become clearer, expect Yellen and other Fed officials to steer away from commenting on this topic. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims hit a 43 year low, down 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000. Analysts had expected a rise to 257,000. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has opened 13 points or 0.07% higher. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory has alarmed and appalled many of our readers. But a new survey has found that wealthy US investors are now MORE confidence about their prospects. UBS Wealth Management Americas latest quarterly Investor Watch report found a jump in optimism among high net worth and ultrahigh net worth investors since last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. They say: UBS surveyed 1,200 wealthy investors immediately before and after the election to determine changes in sentiment and mindset. Since the election, 48% of investors feel optimistic about the short-term economic outlook, up from 39% just 3 weeks earlier. This rise is driven by a sharp increase in optimism among Trump supporters that outweighed a decline among Clinton supporters. Why this optimism, given the concerns over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies on (for example) trade? Well, some investors believe Washington needs shaking up, and like Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to cut regulations. His promise to cut taxes must be a factor too. But while Trump fans move their money into riskier assets, Clinton supporters are being much more conservative. Many fear the president-elect will pull America into recession.... The Economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Buttonwood column has swiftly commented on Ed Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proposal to reform central bank independence. It argues that some of the criticism heaped on central banks has been unfair: A lot of the current criticism of central banks assumes that they had some hidden political agenda (to support the election of Hillary Clinton or to warn voters off Brexit) behind their policy shifts. That is nonsense, in my view. In a low growth, low inflation world. Central banks have had little option but to keep policy loose; many of those that tried to tighten policy have been forced to retreat. and central banks tend to reflect the consensus view of economists which was that Brexit would be bad news (those who think the consensus view has been proved wrong might note that the government has yet even to start the exit process). In short, central banks may have made mistakes but they are honest mistakes. But Buttonwood isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by the most radical part of the paper -- the suggestion that central banks and politicians should co-ordinate on fiscal and monetary policy in times of crisis. On its own merits, this sounds entirely sensible. But if you think central banks are in the political firing line now, what would happen if they started commenting on fiscal policy, particularly close to an election? Imagine if Ms Yellen were to advise the Republicans against tax cuts for the rich? Anyone with an interest in monetary policy should read this excellent paper. But many will find reasons to disagree with it. Off you go then.... Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared testimony hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moved the markets; which makes sense, as most Wall Street economists already expect a rate hike in December. Janet Yellen has resisted any temptation to comment about the US election in her testimony to Congress (boo hiss). The closest she gets is a familiar warning about economic uncertainty: Of course, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and, as always, the appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the outlook and associated risks. Janet Yellen will also tell Congress that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further progress this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She begins her testimony by pointing out that the unemployment rate is now just 4.9%, with around 180,000 new jobs created each month in 2016. And she is hopeful that Americans could see decent pay rises soon: Further employment gains may well help support labor force participation as well as wage gains; indeed, there are some signs that the pace of wage growth has stepped up recently. Yellen also points out that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth race picked up in the last three months: After rising at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of this year, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is estimated to have increased nearly 3 percent in the third quarter. In part, the pickup reflected some rebuilding of inventories and a surge in soybean exports. In addition, consumer spending has continued to post moderate gains, supported by solid growth in real disposable income, upbeat consumer confidence, low borrowing rates, and the ongoing effects of earlier increases in household wealth Janet Yellen is pretty clear that the Fed is close to raising rates: At our meeting earlier this month, the Committee judged that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objectives. Breaking: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has warned that it would be a mistake to leave US interest rates unchanged for too long. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hint that borrowing costs could be raised soon, possibly at the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top line from Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared testimony, which she will deliver to Congress in two hours time. Yellen is arguing that if the Fed waits too long, it might find itself having to hike rates more aggressively to calm an over-heating economy. She says: Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-run policy goals. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability. The FOMC continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability. More to follow.... The Bank of England is actually closer to a model modern central bank than either the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report anyway. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the scorecard: The BoE scores highly thanks to its suite of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmacro-prudential tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to manage the economy -- such as the ability to control how much housebuyers can borrow for a mortgage. But the BoE loses marks because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no joint body overseeing its work. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Balls, Howat and Stansbury are calling for a UK version of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). They say: The FSOC...provides a forum for different regulators to challenge the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views of risks to financial stability and, because it is chaired by the Treasury, it can confer important political legitimacy for contentious regulatory decisions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report argues that central banks and governments need to work more closely when interest rates have reached rock bottom (the zero lower bound). That could includes showering the economy with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchelicopter money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, if government spending cuts have created a low-inflation, low-growth quagmire. Ed Balls, James Howat and Anna Stansbury argue that central banks are struggling to get inflation up to target because governments aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spending enough. They say: Many economists have argued that recent austerity has not improved fiscal positions much, and may even have worsened them. Rather, there is reason to believe that fiscal policy is structurally prone to undermine monetary policy at the zero lower bound. Indeed, many governments also responded with austerity in the Depression, the last time that western economies fell into a liquidity trap. Explanations for the popularity of austerity at the zero lower bound include that recessions are opportunities for those calling for a smaller state to trim public expenditure. They can blame the recession on lax fiscal policy during the boom years. Households, particularly those with the median voters, are sympathetic to the argument that the government must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tighten its belt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the same time as they do. So if austerity drags an economy into a liquidity trap, policymakers may be forced to consider unconventional methods, such as helicopter money -- under which a central bank creates new money to fund an expansionary fiscal policy. This is a controversial issue in economics - and this paper explains how this could happen: The first principle is that the central bank should shape the broad outlines of the coordination. Not only does the central bank have macro-economic expertise which is vital if the coordination is to work, its leadership of the process is crucial to avoiding fiscal dominance. The central bank should be in charge of both initiating and ending the monetary-fiscal coordination process. To minimise political pressures on the central bank, the coordination process also needs to be clearly defined at the outset. In the event of helicopter drops, for example, the central bank needs to outline triggers for stopping them, such as an inflation knockout. This will protect the operational independence of core monetary policy, thereby anchoring inflation expectations. The second principle is that any coordination mechanism must maintain political control over fiscal policy. So although the central bank can propose the outlines of a coordination plan, the government can refuse to participate. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the coordinating mechanism must distinguish between the stance and the content of fiscal policy. So while the central bank might call for looser fiscal policy, it should not comment on the composition of this loosening. Admittedly, the content of fiscal policy affects its macro-economic impact. Nonetheless, given the political dangers of commenting on individual fiscal items, and the democratic argument for the government to retain discretion over different tax and spending components, any coordination mechanism should limit itself to the fiscal stance. The third principle is that monetary-fiscal coordination should be strictly limited to the zero lower bound. Even if a coordination mechanism effectively protects central bank independence and preserves democratic control over fiscal policy, entering the realm of fiscal policy still presents considerable threats to central bank independence. The prospect of central bankers routinely commenting on fiscal policy may undermine political support for central bank independence or may open up the central bank to reciprocal criticism over monetary policy from the government. By limiting such coordination to only when it is most effective, these risks can be minimised. So much for my prediction that Ed Balls wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to perform any dance moves on the radio.... Ed Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 research on central banks is getting some attention this morning, thanks to the Strictly effect. Political journalist Iain Martin reckons Balls made a good argument on the Today Programme this morning (highlights are here) Macroeconomics lecturer David Chivers points out that Balls still supports central bank independence - but with more political oversight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction from the public: Bloomberg have also covered the Balls paper, and point out that other experts are calling for central bank reforms: Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has said that central bank independence, conceived as a way to stop governments from stoking inflation with measures designed to gain electoral support, is an outdated concept. Governments and monetary policy makers need to cooperate to ensure the maximum effectiveness of stimulus in a world where demand is chronically deficient, he said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund this month. More here: Architect of Bank of England Independence Ed Balls Urges Rethink Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague, Angela Monaghan, on Ed Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central banking paper: The Bank of England has become too powerful in the aftermath of the financial crisis and must be reined in, according to the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Balls, one of the masterminds behind the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence in 1997, said the issue was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfinished business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and called for closer ties between Threadneedle Street and government. The former Labour MP and contestant on this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Strictly Come Dancing, said that while the Bank should retain operational independence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c setting interest rates and targeting inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it should not have to shoulder the entire burden for maintaining Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability. Balls told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the [US] Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles. But the reforms we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfinished business... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full story: Ed Balls is effectively criticising some of the reforms made by his old rival George Osborne. In 1997, the new Labour government handed control of interest rates to the Bank of England, under a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctripartite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 system where financial stability was also handled by the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury. That system was heavily criticised when the credit crunch struck, bringing down Northern Rock, as no-one seemed to be in charge. So Osborne concentrated more power at the Bank of England when he became chancellor in 2010 Our politics editor, Heather Stewart explains all: Newsflash: UK retail sales jumped by 1.9% during October, the biggest monthly rise since July. On an annual basis, consumers bought 7.4% more stuff than in October 2015, which is the biggest rise since April 2002. The ONS says colder weather helped clothes sales, and Halloween larks may also have boosted supermarkets. Hot take: the Brexit vote isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopping Britain hitting the shops.... European credit strategist Tomas Hirst argues that governments have caused the furore over central bank independence, by failing to use their tax and spending powers better: Top central bankers would agree. They often warn that monetary policy can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create structural reforms or improve productivity - but it does give politicians a window of opportunity to act. However... those decisions can be tough, and unpopular. So loose monetary policy can also dampen the pressure to act (as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the eurozone, where big decisions are only taken when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an actual crisis) Ed Balls is also arguing that central banks should welcome more political accountability, as it would protect them in the next financial crisis. The former shadow chancellor told the Today programme that: If in the end when things start to go wrong, everything is concentrated in the Bank of England only, that is politically quite dangerous for the Bank. So, in order to protect independence, the Bank needs more political support and accountability. On Tuesday, BoE governor Mark Carney argued that some politicians are conducting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive blame deflection game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, by saying central banks are the sole cause of inequality and low interest rates. Balls thinks Carney has a point, saying: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very worrying seeing Mark Carney being attacked. Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls has told the Today Programme that central bank independence is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunfinished\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business -- and that no country has the perfect central bank set-up yet. He pointed out that central bankers have played a vital role since the financial crisis struck; but now have an awful lot of power: Over the last five years, we have hugely relied on central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to sustain growth, to keep our economies growing, and yet at the same time they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re under big attack. In Congress, the Fed being heavily criticised. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen not just MPs attacking Mark Carney and the Bank of England, but even our Prime Minister a few weeks ago slapping Mark Carney down. I think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them to be politically criticised, but, the reforms we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Balls believes the Bank of England needs more accountability to parliament, especially as its monetary policy has such a big impact on the distribution of wealth It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to have a financial policy committee making decisions about our whole financial system, but frankly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sufficient accountability, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a clear target, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making [decisions] that are quite distributionally politically sensitive. If things go wrong, then politicians would have to step in and say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gap in the system. What we need is a systemic risk body chaired by the chancellor, which is overseeing the whole system and setting a mandate for the Bank of England and also there if a crisis starts to build, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gap we need to fill. Balls is adamant that central banks have been doing a good job, at a very difficult time, without enough support from the government: The low interest rate policy over the last few years is the only thing that has stopped our economy slipping back into depression. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been trying to meet a target for low inflation, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been undershooting because of the deflation forces in the economy. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing their job. We actually say, what we need to have is a better dialogue between central banks and governments. If government had done a bit more work to support the economy through infrastructure spending, that would have made it easier for the Bank of England. Ed Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paper on central bank independence comes at a good time, and not just because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hanging on in Strictly. Disenchantment with central bankers has been growing steadily; as opponents question whether keeping interest rates close to zero and pumping up asset prices was actually working. In Britain, the Bank of England has been under steady fire from pro-Leave campaigners because of its warnings against Brexit. In America, the Federal Reserve has been scorched by Donald Trump. He vowed to replace Fed chair Janet Yellen when her first term ends in 2018. And the European Central Bank has been heavily criticised for its role in eurozone austerity, and for its huge bond-buying programme. Chris Giles of the Financial Times points out that criticism is coming in from across the political spectrum: Concerns about central bank policies and over-reach span the political horizon. They range from president-elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusations that the Fed kept short-term interest rates low at the behest of the Obama administration, Brexiters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 complaints that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventions in the debate over leaving the EU were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneath the dignity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the venerable institution and German politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rage at the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions. Most complaints in the US have come from the political right. But in Britain there have been as many from the left. In setting up a review of the BoE, the leadership of the Labour party has questioned whether the central bank should be forced to fund infrastructure projects. Ed Balls is now presenting his paper on the Today programme. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that central bank independence must be maintained, but with additional political accountability. He also defends the Bank of England over its current very loose monetary policy. Record low interest rates and quantitative easing (buying government bonds with new money) helped to ward off a new great depression, he agues: After months of delighting, or horrifying, the nation with his dancing skills, Ed Balls has sashayed back to the world of economics by arguing that the independence of the Bank of England should be curbed. The former shadow chancellor has co-authored a new academic paper which examines what a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodel central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would look like. It conclude that reforms need to be made, to address the growing public unhappiness about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unelected, technocratic institutions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which now play such a massive role in the global economy. And that should includes more political oversight of the Bank of England, to allow politicians and other experts to challenge its decisions where appropriate, creating more accountability. The old consensus that central banks should get as much independence has possible is now inadequate, says the paper - which Balls co-wrote with James Howat and Anna Stansbury of Harvard University. They write: Absolutist interpretations of complete central bank independence may both undermine the pursuit of new central bank objectives and fray the political support that currently exists for central bank autonomy in their core monetary policy function. Indeed, popular discontent towards central banks is growing in the US, UK and the euro-zone. We need a more nuanced approach to central bank independence in this brave new world. Balls was one of the key players behind giving the Bank of England control of monetary policy (back in the 90s, before he swapped Westminster for the dance floor). And this paper argues that new curbs should be brought in, to fight \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgroupthink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the Bank of England. It says: After the centralisation of prudential regulation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both of the micro and macro variety \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and systemic risk monitoring inside the Bank of England, there is a danger that the UK money-credit constitution is too concentrated in the central bank, leading to the possibility of groupthink, a lack of oversight and ultimately risks to central bank independence. The solution? A body, chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which provides a forum for different regulators to share information, opinions and challenge the central bank perspective. However, the paper still argues firmly that central bank independence is worth fighting for, rather then handing the levers of monetary policy back to the elected politicians. It concludes: The recent US election, and the resulting Republican control of Congress as well as the White House, are widely expected to lead to further criticism of the power and independence of the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, in recent weeks we have seen increasingly open political attacks on Bank of England Governor Mark Carney from Brexit supporters. But we are clear that this is no time to throw the baby out with the bathwater.... We reiterate that the case for operational independence in both monetary and macro-prudential policy is strong: to retreat on this now would be a serious mistake You can see whole report here. Balls is discussing the paper this morning, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details soon. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Radio 4 right now (so no chance to show off those silky moves, alas). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the UK retail sales figures, at 9.30am, to see if British consumers are still shrugging off the Brexit vote. The financial markets look calmer today, after recent wild gyrations following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory. Bond yields have settled down, and the equities markets are expected to open little changed. Things may liven up this afternoon, though, when Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen testifies to Congress (from 3pm GMT or 10am EDT) Yellen is sure to field questions about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal to splurge $1trn on a new infrastructure programme, and also about her own future; as the president-elect has been so critical of her in recent months. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony should be released at 1pm GMT (8am EDT). And on the corporate front, Royal Mail, Majestic Wine and retailer Ted Baker are reporting results.",

It could absolutely collapse next week as the dollar appreciates further. The market seems convinced that the Fed will hike interest rates in December and tighten its belt further in 2017. Meanwhile the ECB and other major central banks are widely expected to maintain their current extremely loose policy stances intact well into 2017 at the very least. As such, the dollar is getting stronger across the board, but especially against currencies where the central bank is still uber-dovish such as the euro...</p> <p>To get anywhere near parity, the euro/dollar will first need to break and then hold below the prior support around the 1.0460/1.0525 area. As things stand, this looks like a good possibility... However, as always, it is worth remembering that the markets are forward-looking. As such, the outlook for the diverging monetary policy stances in the Eurozone and US may already be priced in, if not fully then maybe partially. But price needs to confirm this view by creating a distinct reversal pattern.

If you leave that you then have to have some sort of hard border on how you can check up things like, for example Argentinian beef. Say that beef was infected by some bacteria and if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have border checks then that meat could come into Northern Ireland, go across the border into the south and that would mean it was now inside the EU. Some people talk about using electronic tagging to track goods including that meat but I just cannot see how that would work. If we were to leave the Customs Union then a hard border even for those practical reasons would be inevitable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Ramsey said the Northern Ireland Executive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuit of a 12.5% corporation tax rate to compete with the Irish Republic in terms of foreign direct investment may be redundant once the entire UK including the region exits the EU.</p> <p>He said that when the power sharing government in Belfast embarked on its campaign for low corporation tax \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being in Europe was a given.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All this changed once the UK voted for Brexit in June, he said.</p> <p>The Ulster Bank chief economist said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In many ways perhaps we in Northern Ireland thought 12.5% was a one way process in which the rate would attract foreign direct investment into the region. But the rules of the game have been changed with some foreign corporations who are already here reconsidering their position about staying here. In my view the impact of a potential 12.5% corporation tax rate has been weakened significantly. If you were a foreign investor thinking of coming here you would think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchold on a minute there is no clarity about Northern Ireland and Europe whereas there is clarity in the Irish Republic.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 On that basis they would decide to locate in the Republic as low corporation tax inside the EU is already guaranteed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582f073de4b090fc81282812\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-18T13:56:53.744Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fed's Bullard leaning towards December rate hike</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US, on the other hand, is set for a rate hike in December, most economists believe.

And the reason for that is because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of spare capacity in factories in the far east and retail is constantly looking for new and better sources of supply, cheaper sources of supply. So I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to mitigate most of the currency fall. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still looking at prices rises around 4-5%. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582ee422e4b03207800c3820\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-18T11:28:04.705Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Staffordshire HQ hit by mini Tornado</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4743eb318127e4aeaef1534b96cce51feb15e2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4743eb318127e4aeaef1534b96cce51feb15e2c3/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damage caused by 70 mph winds at JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damage caused by 70 mph winds at JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>My colleague Sean Farrell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/18/mini-tornado-jcb-world-hq-staffordshire\">reports</a>:</strong></p> <p>Workers at JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world headquarters in Staffordshire were stunned on Thursday when a mini tornado caused a wall to collapse and windows to crash to the ground.</p> <p>Production of diggers stopped after the tornado tore into the side of the factory.

                "bodyText":"The oil price has been dominated in recent days by the strength of the dollar weighing it down, and hopes of an agreement to cut output at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting at the end of the month giving some support. But the weekly US inventory numbers also have an impact, as do the Baker Hughes surveys of the number of operating rigs. The latest Baker Hughes numbers, just released, showed 20 rigs were added last week, the 22nd rise in 25 weeks. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. The recent fall in the euro against the dollar brings closer the possibility of the currencies reaching parity. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: As the week draws to a close, the euro/dollar is still limping, now below 1.06. It could absolutely collapse next week as the dollar appreciates further. The market seems convinced that the Fed will hike interest rates in December and tighten its belt further in 2017. Meanwhile the ECB and other major central banks are widely expected to maintain their current extremely loose policy stances intact well into 2017 at the very least. As such, the dollar is getting stronger across the board, but especially against currencies where the central bank is still uber-dovish such as the euro... To get anywhere near parity, the euro/dollar will first need to break and then hold below the prior support around the 1.0460/1.0525 area. As things stand, this looks like a good possibility... However, as always, it is worth remembering that the markets are forward-looking. As such, the outlook for the diverging monetary policy stances in the Eurozone and US may already be priced in, if not fully then maybe partially. But price needs to confirm this view by creating a distinct reversal pattern. Until and unless such a technical signal is generated, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. Despite a record high in the US tech-heavy market Nasdaq (subsequently reversed), European shares have ended the week on a downbeat note. The continuing uncertainties over Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election have made investors in Europe cautious. And with the next possible electoral shock coming next month in the Italian referendum, it is the Italian market that bore the brunt of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: A record high in the Nasdaq and a pullback in bond yields helped to unwind some of the early losses in stock markets, though most European equity benchmarks finished the week on a soft note. Election fever has caught the investing world. With populism running amuck and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum up next, Italian shares have been the notable losers this week. Meanwhile Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action serves as a metaphor for the entire week, indecisive, with a firm dose of caution after the volatility of last week. Stocks are modestly lower across the board, but for different reasons. Investors in the UK and Europe know that weakening currencies have flattered performance this week, while in the US they remain overextended to the upside. The former worry that a period of weakness for the US dollar after such a strong run could increase the chances of a correction for stocks, while the latter are wondering how long the market can keep moving higher even as the currency rises. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 18.94 points or 0.28% at 6775.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.2% to 10,664.56 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.52% at 4504.35 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.75% to 16,265.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.09% lower at 8622.9 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.81% to 611.93 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 40 points at 0.2%. Another public appearance by a Federal Reserve member, another step towards a rise in interest rates next month. Kansas City Fed president Esther George told an oil conference in Houston the Fed should move \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sooner rather than later\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but be cautious. She said: My view is that monetary policy should .. slowly raise the federal funds rate to promote maximum employment commensurate with the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-run potential to increase production. But she added, as Reuters reports, that she did not advocate high rates: I do not think it will serve the economy well. I do think we have to move more systematically. She also said it was too soon to say how the incoming Donald Trump administration would affect the outlook for Fed policy. While US markets have been hovering around new highs, Europe has been struggling to keep up. Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, said: European equity markets have failed to make much progress one way or the other this week, kicking the week off and ending it at more or less the same level. The post-election Trump rally is seen to be wearing thin this side of the Atlantic, as investors digest the growing divergence between European and US economies and the outlook for monetary policy. The dollar has continued its ascent in the wake of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish testimony before Congress, where her positive comments regarding the US economy have spurred the currency to break through 101.00 and hit fresh 13 year highs. Yet while Yellen was more or less confirming a rate hike in December and several rate hikes for next year, European Central Bank President, Draghi was clearly on the other side of the fence. Draghi stated that the Eurozone recovery was reliant on ECB stimulus possibly hinting that ECB monetary stimulus will continue beyond its planned conclusion next March. As a result, the Euro has continued to sell of against the dollar and is currently at $1.0609 setting its sights on $1.04 against the dollar going forward... Gold, like bonds, has been one of the more noticeable losers of a Trump president elect, with the precious metal falling over 10% since he clinched the White House. With plans for reflationary policies such as a $1trillion spending spree on infrastructure and control of both houses meaning political gridlock is less likely, inflation expectations have risen sharply, along with debt yields and interest rate hike expectations. Hawkish comments from Yellen in her testimony to Congress renewed selling pressure on gold and given that the US dollar index is trading at fresh 13 year highs, we could see expect to see a more significant correction yet, the trend remains bearish [and] precious metal miners could be set for more pain to come. With a US interest rate rise next month now seen as almost inevitable, US markets are taking a breather after their recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 23 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.19% better. Meanwhile the dollar remains at near-14 year highs against a basket of currencies, while US bond yields are looking at their best fortnightly rise for 13 years. The euro may be weakening against the dollar today, but there is no doubt which continues to be the worst performing currency this year: Back to Brexit, and the impact it may have on Ireland. Henry McDonald in Belfast writes: One of Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading economists has warned that if the UK leaves the European Customs Union then a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard border\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the region and the Irish Republic is inevitable. Ulster Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist in the province Richard Ramsey also told a Dublin Business School conference on Brexit on Friday that the Northern Ireland government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of a low corporation tax - 12.5% as in the Irish Republic - has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fallen far down the agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to the UK voting to leave the European Union. Speaking in the Mac Arts Theatre in Belfast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral Quarter, Ramsey said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Customs Union is looking at the trade in goods and common tariffs coming into that area. If you leave that you then have to have some sort of hard border on how you can check up things like, for example Argentinian beef. Say that beef was infected by some bacteria and if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have border checks then that meat could come into Northern Ireland, go across the border into the south and that would mean it was now inside the EU. Some people talk about using electronic tagging to track goods including that meat but I just cannot see how that would work. If we were to leave the Customs Union then a hard border even for those practical reasons would be inevitable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ramsey said the Northern Ireland Executive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuit of a 12.5% corporation tax rate to compete with the Irish Republic in terms of foreign direct investment may be redundant once the entire UK including the region exits the EU. He said that when the power sharing government in Belfast embarked on its campaign for low corporation tax \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being in Europe was a given.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All this changed once the UK voted for Brexit in June, he said. The Ulster Bank chief economist said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In many ways perhaps we in Northern Ireland thought 12.5% was a one way process in which the rate would attract foreign direct investment into the region. But the rules of the game have been changed with some foreign corporations who are already here reconsidering their position about staying here. In my view the impact of a potential 12.5% corporation tax rate has been weakened significantly. If you were a foreign investor thinking of coming here you would think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchold on a minute there is no clarity about Northern Ireland and Europe whereas there is clarity in the Irish Republic.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 On that basis they would decide to locate in the Republic as low corporation tax inside the EU is already guaranteed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US, on the other hand, is set for a rate hike in December, most economists believe. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted as much when she gave her testimony to Congress on Thursday, and Fed board member James Bullard has become the latest to back such a move. Reuters reports: Federal Reserve policymaker James Bullard is leaning toward supporting an interest rate increase in December, he said on Friday, adding that a plethora of potential changes under incoming president Donald Trump could affect future policy. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Bullard said the debate is now shifting toward the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate path in 2017 and how Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies on taxes, infrastructure, spending and regulation will affect growth, productivity and ultimately Fed policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets are currently putting a high probability on a December move by the FOMC. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m leaning toward supporting that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bullard, a voting member of the U.S. central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting committee, told a conference in Frankfurt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the question now is more about 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Markets now put a 90 percent chance on the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points on Dec 14. Bullard said some of the new administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures could have a significant impact on the economy in 2018 but some possible proposals to curb immigration and trade may take a decade to have a major impact. Strong economic data from the UK - the latest being better than expected retail sales figures for October - have put the idea of an interest rate cut on hold. Indeed, the next move is likely to be upwards, despite the Bank of England maintaining it was keeping its options open. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a hike too soon, or indeed a hefty rise when it comes: After an action-packed week highlighted by Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30-hour visit to Athens, the Greek government has stepped up calls for debt relief, with officials saying it is only a matter of days before the country concludes a second bailout review that can formally open discussion of the issue. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s straight-talking finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very shortsighted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monumental debt pile was not cut, echoing Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that people needed hope. If the euro zone is going to survive, the number-one requirement is to make sure people see that the eurozone can solve its problems. If it just postpones political decisions and kicks the can down the road, then people will say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not working. At almost 180 % of GDP, the debt mountain is widely believed to be unmanageable with both the IMF and the outgoing US president saying economic recovery now depends on at least part of it being written off. Last night, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble shot down the suggestion, once again, saying it would be a deterrent to Greece forging ahead with reforms. As Philip Hammond prepares to present his maiden autumn statement on Wednesday, speculation is mounting about possible rabbits out of hats. The chancellor has already signalled that he will ease the pace of austerity set out by his predecessor George Osborne, but this does not mean he is planning big giveaways. Berenberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kallum Pickering believes the announcement could well underwhelm markets: With no immediate economic crisis to deal with, the new chancellor Phillip Hammond is unlikely to pander to markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 desires and announce a major fiscal stimulus at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. Despite the better-than-expected near-term economic performance, the long-term economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Beyond the next couple of years, the long-term economic and fiscal outlook will be heavily influenced by the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU. Pending such uncertainty, we anticipate a very cautious approach to fiscal policy from the new chancellor. Volkswagen, the German carmaker, is cutting 30,000 jobs as it restructures the business following the diesel emissions scandal. Most of the jobs - 23,000 - will go in Germany. VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Matthias M\u00c3\u00bcller, described it as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest reform package in the history of our core brand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last year the company admitted it had falsified the results of 11 million emission tests on diesel cars. Read our full story on the cuts here: First Toblerone, now Maltesers: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the Toblerone controversy: Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, has told consumers to expect price rises on the high street from January, as the weak pound starts to feed through. He told Bloomberg Television: I would expect it to begin to come through January next year. And really that inflationary bubble will last all year. But it is a one off bubble, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not likely to affect us the following year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not likely to affect retail anything like as much as the devaluation of the pound. So the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen 15, 20%. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting prices at most to go up 5% but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m expecting a bit less than that. And the reason for that is because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of spare capacity in factories in the far east and retail is constantly looking for new and better sources of supply, cheaper sources of supply. So I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to mitigate most of the currency fall. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still looking at prices rises around 4-5%. JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Staffordshire HQ hit by mini Tornado My colleague Sean Farrell reports: Workers at JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world headquarters in Staffordshire were stunned on Thursday when a mini tornado caused a wall to collapse and windows to crash to the ground. Production of diggers stopped after the tornado tore into the side of the factory. No one was injured in the incident and the factory was back up and running after 30 minutes. The damaged areas have been cordoned off. JCB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assembly manager, Richard Williams, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was about 30 yards away at the time and I heard an enormous crash. I turned around and saw the wall and the windows had come out and a big whirlwind of leaves and branches blowing around outside. Luckily no one was in the vicinity at the time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The JCB factory was one of the sites hit by winds of more than 70mph that battered Staffordshire, Shropshire and mid-Wales. Trees were uprooted and buildings were damaged as a series of small, brief tornadoes left a trail of destruction. David Rees, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, says the bonds sell-off in emerging markets is likely to continue: Dollar-denominated government bonds have suffered disproportionately during the emerging market sell-off since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. We expect dollar-denominated bonds to continue to underperform equities and currencies. Whereas equity prices have fallen by 3.5% on average in local currency terms since the November 8th election, and currencies have depreciated by a similar amount against the US dollar, dollar- denominated sovereign bonds have registered losses of nearly 4.5% on average. The upshot is that we believe the underperformance of hard currency bonds will continue. Global bonds are on course for their biggest two-week loss in more than a quarter of a century, as rising inflation dampens demand. Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index is set for a 4% loss over the last fortnight - the biggest since at least 1990 according to Reuters. Reuters reports: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock win in the US election last week has stoked bets that economic plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. Rising inflation erodes the value of bonds which offer set interest rates over their lifespan. Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England responsible for monetary policy, has been speaking in London. He insisted the prolonged spell of ultra-low interest rates had not driven a rise in inequality in the UK. The Bank has been under fire in recent weeks by critics who claim the loose monetary stance has hurt some households. Here is the full report from my colleague Katie Allen who attended the event: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets are now firmly in the red: A strong dollar is hitting mining stocks, and Italian banks are also among the biggest losers. Nerves are mounting in Italy ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on constitutional reform. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign if he loses the referendum. Lord Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, is joining the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, set up by the former chancellor George Osborne who chairs the thinktank. Not an entirely surprising appointment. The two men worked together in government, after O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill was given a peerage and appointed to Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury team last year with responsibility for the northern powerhouse project. (The idea is to drive investment and growth in the north.) O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill stepped down as a Treasury minister in September and resigned the Conservative whip amid reported tensions over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to China. The high-profile businessman is known for coining the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, an acronym for the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said: Having been involved in its inception, I have always been a huge supporter of the Northern Powerhouse and through my participation in the Northern Powerhouse Partnership I look forward to continuing to play a role in ensuring that the original vision becomes a reality. In a second appointment to the NPP, the former director general of the CBI John Cridland will also join the board. Osborne said: Today is a milestone in the creation of our Northern Powerhouse Partnership. Our first board meeting, here in Sheffield, brings together some of the north\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest employers and civic leaders to see how we can work together to create a powerhouse. I am delighted that Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill and John Cridland are also joining the board and getting involved in the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. They are both hugely regarded figures across the North and two of the brightest and the best when it comes to thinking proactively about how to drive transformational change for the region. Here is what Draghi had to say on eurozone inflation: Despite the recovery in growth and employment, the persisting output gap is still keeping inflation dynamics weak. The October inflation rate stood at 0.5%. While this marks the highest level recorded in almost two years, it remains far below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objective [of below, but close to 2%]. And while we expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months, much of this increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the mechanical unwinding of the extreme oil price declines a year ago. We do not yet see a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Draghi said recovery in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was still underpinned by support from the central bank: The euro area recovery still relies to a considerable degree on accommodative monetary policy. The recovery in credit is being facilitated by a more resilient banking sector, but the impetus comes from our monetary policy. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 2% in 2015, and the International Monetary Fund is predicting growth of 1.7% this year followed by 1.5% in 2017. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech strikes a decidedly dovish and cautious note. He suggests that while the eurozone is in reasonable shape, key risks to the recovery remain. We have ... every reason to be more confident in the strength of the recovery than we were one year ago. But we cannot be sanguine over the economic outlook. Besides the geopolitical risks that remain prevalent, there are indeed three factors that warrant caution: the profitability of euro area banks, the relative weakness of inflation dynamics, and the dependence of the recovery on accommodative monetary policy. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has given a clear signal that policymakers will continue to support the eurozone economy with monetary stimulus. Giving a keynote speech at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt, Draghi said policy would remain lose amid weak inflationary pressures. Even if there are many encouraging trends in the euro area economy, the recovery remains highly reliant on a constellation of financing conditions that, in turn, depend on continued monetary support. The ECB will continue to act, as warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards a level below, but close to 2%. The FTSE 100 is slightly down in early trading, after closing up 45 points or 0.7% on Thursday. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are mixed. Nerves persist in Italy, where bond yields are sharply higher as political concerns rise to the fore ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,783 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.3% at 10,716 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 4,538 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1% at 16,376 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,698 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 341 Holger Schmieding, economist at the German bank Berenberg, says the ECB won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in any hurry to follow the Fed and tighten monetary policy. Pundits including us expect the ECB to prolong its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 billion monthly asset purchases by at least three and more likely six months beyond March 2017 before finally starting to taper, announcing that decision to extend purchases at its 8 December meeting. In addition, the ECB will likely make some technical changes to its programme to broaden the scope of eligible (German) paper without changing the capital key distribution of purchases or breaking new ground by venturing into purchases of major new asset classes such as bank bonds or equities. The euro against the dollar over the past year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gain is the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss, with strength in the US currency pushing the euro below $1.06 for the first time in almost a year. It is currently trading at $1.0596. The single\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is suffering its longest run of losses since 1999, when it first launch as an accounting currency, according to the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of Bloomberg data. The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest boost comes from Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, who hinted to Congress on Thursday that another rate hike in December was on the cards. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is due to give a speech in Frankfurt shortly. Investors will listen closely for his views on the current outlook for the eurozone, and any hints on possible changes to monetary policy.",

[<em>Brexit for a start, one would think]</em>.</p> <p>But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global uncertainty, partly due to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment...</p> <p>Our monetary policy measures since June 2014\u00c2\u00ad have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery...</p> <p>Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. </p> <p>Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. </p> <p>It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. </p> </blockquote> <p>But then he called for further action elsewhere:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. </p> <p>In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area... </p> <p>The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment...</p> <p>Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T16:34:29.007Z\">at 4.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5833159ae4b0e0ad2d75bc65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T15:43:12.927Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden movement, it appears that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (attempted) reassurances that the government is working to avoid a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for businesses, comments that perhaps suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resurgence.</p> <p>And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively.</p> <p>The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip this Monday (the greenback maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though without much actual momentum to push it any higher. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583308a4e4b0da4920d6aee3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T15:03:52.650Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement from new UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Royal London Asset Management has called for measures to boost growth.

The government should counteract the lack of private sector investment since the financial crisis by improving transport infrastructure, housing and power generation while continuing to support research and new technology.</p> <p>Contrary to popular opinion, governments can borrow their way out of debt if interest rates are low enough - or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their way deeper into debt if austerity causes the economy to weaken.</p> </blockquote> <p><em> <br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-583309eae4b0e0ad2d75bc45\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-21T14:56:02.417Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets head towards record highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A rise in the oil price on hopes of an Opec deal next week to limit production has helped push US markets higher in early trading.

                "bodyText":"A rising oil price, along with political developments in France and Germany, has helped push European stock markets into positive territory on the first trading day of the week. The prospect that Francois Fillon could beat Marine Le Pen in next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French presidential election has given investors some comfort, as has Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement she was running for a fourth term as German chancellor. Meanwhile the climb in crude, based on growing hopes that Opec would reach an agreement on limiting output at its meeting next week, has lifted commodity companies, while dollar weakness has also helped. But London shares slipped back from their highs after a bounce in sterling - the leading UK index is full of exporters and overseas earners who benefit from a weak pound. The currency responded to supposed hints from UK prime minister Theresa May about a Brexit transition deal. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 2.19 points or 0.03% at 6777.96 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was 0.19% higher at 10,685.13 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.56% at 4529.58 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.19% to 16,297.26 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.1% down at 8614.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 615.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 0.4%, hovering around a new peak of 18947. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have also recorded new highs. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On the effect of the US election on the euro area economic outlook, Draghi said it is too early too now. But he said, as with the UK referendum vote, the reaction in the markets was significant to start with, but then muted. Markets have shown their resilience, helped by the actions of in the first case the Bank of England, then the ECB. But clearly these changes have a long term impact which difficult to assess and in the case of the UK, depends on the shape of negotiations and the length of time it takes to find an agreement. ECB president Mario Draghi is now responding to the comments of MEPs. He says he understands the concerns about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconventional measures, and says there are some risks. But he says they do not see an asset price bubble developing. He said the risks are for the time being contained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but we watch them closely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Low interest rates are a consequence of low growth and low inflation around the world, he said, not the creation of the ECB. Policy rates have to be low to stimulate growth. By and large, regarding the negative rate situation , the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Our monetary policy is by and large the same as in the US, UK and Japan, says Draghi. He denies that the bank is overstepping its mandate (as was suggested by several MEPs). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full Reuters report on the comments from ECB board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 on the bank not contemplating buying stocks as part of its QE programme. Away from the ECB and back to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference in London, where Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has begun addressing delegates. Follow his speech on our politics live blog from here. Meanwhile, while ECB president Mario Draghi is listening to the various comments - often negative - on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, executive board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 has also been speaking. According to Reuters, he said that at some point the ECB would scale down its stimulus programme but not yet. And there was never any discussion about buying stocks as part of the QE programme. A number of MEPs are lining up to point out the problems in the eurozone and criticise some of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, while saying growth is still fragile. Draghi has begun speaking, apologising for his late arrival due to transport problems [we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been there...] You can follow the session here. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has defended the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy actions once more, and repeated his calls for governments to step up their own reforms to boost growth. And he said the bank needed to continue its supportive policies to bring inflation close to its target. In a speech to the European Parliament relating to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, he said challenges had increased since his last session there in February. [Brexit for a start, one would think]. But he said the European economy had shown resilience to the global uncertainty, partly due to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions: The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate, but steady, pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment... Our monetary policy measures since June 2014 have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery... Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But then he called for further action elsewhere: However... our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area... The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment... Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. The jump in the pound took the attention away from events in Europe, and also pushed the FTSE 100 lower after a bright start. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a morning of euro strength, following the double whammy of Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement she will run for a fourth term as Chancellor and Francois Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right-wing primary win causing potential problems for the unpleasant Marine Le Pen, out of nowhere focus shifted to the pound this afternoon. While it might be a case of scrambling around for a narrative to explain a rather sudden movement, it appears that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (attempted) reassurances that the government is working to avoid a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for businesses, comments that perhaps suggest a transitional deal, have caused sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resurgence. And what a resurgence it was, with the pound rocketing more than 1% higher against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro; its performance against the latter is especially remarkable given that it was nearly half a percent in the red earlier in the day. This in turn dragged the FTSE back below 6800, despite the chunky gains made in the oil and mining sectors, while also helping cement the 0.3% and 0.6% growth seen by the DAX and CAC respectively. The Dow Jones also benefited from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip this Monday (the greenback maintained its 0.3% loss against the euro), with the US index rising nearly 40 points. That leaves the Dow around 20 points from a fresh all-time peak, though without much actual momentum to push it any higher. Ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement from new UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Royal London Asset Management has called for measures to boost growth. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London, said: Now is the time to reset fiscal policy and the focus should be on boosting nominal growth to offset Brexit uncertainty rather than trying to deliver \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcausterity-lite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Going for growth should reduce the debt burden over time as the government can borrow money in the gilt market at a cost of 1-2 per cent per annum and invest in an economy with long term growth potential of four. The government should counteract the lack of private sector investment since the financial crisis by improving transport infrastructure, housing and power generation while continuing to support research and new technology. Contrary to popular opinion, governments can borrow their way out of debt if interest rates are low enough - or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their way deeper into debt if austerity causes the economy to weaken. A rise in the oil price on hopes of an Opec deal next week to limit production has helped push US markets higher in early trading. The post-election rally has continued, boosted by the expectation of infrastructure spending and other measures to boost the US economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 51 points or 0.28%, just 15 points below its record high. Meanwhile the Nasdaq index of technology companies has already reached a new peak, up 0.56%. The pound has just jumped by over one cent against the US dollar....and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite clear why! After a slow start, sterling suddenly jumped by over 1% to hit $1.25, from $1.234 this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dipping back a bit now, as traders struggle to work out what happened. One theory is that Theresa May has sparked the rally, by telling business leaders this morning that she wants to avoid a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That has raised hopes that Britain might seek a transitional arrangement, to help businesses adjust to life outside the European Union. Reuters are calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmystery move\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saying: Sterling jumped by a full cent in a few seconds just after 1325 GMT on Monday, with dealers at several major banks saying there had been no clear driver of the move in a currency still smarting from a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flash crash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffda month ago. Influential MP Andrew Tyrie is highly unamused that the Bank of England is considering hiking the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deposit protection scheme back to \u00c2\u00a385,000, less than 18 months after cutting it to \u00c2\u00a375,000. As we explained at 11.26am, the changes are driven by sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility, with the BoE tacking and jibing to keep in line with the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100,000 limit set by European regulators. But Tyrie, who chairs parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee, thinks these changes undermine public confidence in the banking system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The announcement today of another change to the deposit protection limit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there have been about seven in the last decade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a recipe for yet more uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Each change will have carried a cost. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely valuable for the level of deposit protection to be well known for long periods. This allows savers and small businesses time to adjust. Stability is what is needed. That is what can entrench public confidence in depositor protection, the most valuable commodity of all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These recent changes have not been the fault of the PRA. They are an EU requirement, imposed by the European Commission. The current EU rules have always been unacceptable to a country such as the UK, in the EU but outside the Eurozone. Tyrie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution is to take back control of these rules - which kick in if a bank fails: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The absurd situation, in which the UK is left vulnerable, at the discretion of the European Commission, to frequent changes in our deposit scheme, must be brought to an end. Brexit should give the UK the opportunity to set its own level of protection. We should take it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Francois Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to shrink the French state by cutting 500,000 jobs will surely alarm France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions, and could be fiercely fought. Cutting unemployment benefit and raising the retirement age will also be controversial, should Fillon become the next president. But MEP Philippe Juvin argues that Fillon is what France needs, telling Bloomberg TV this morning that: The financial markets want stability and they want trust. With Fillon they would get stability and trust. This chart, from the Economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Cliffe, shows how Fillon won support from Republican voters across the country: From Paris, Kim Willsher reports that French politicians are swiftly rethinking their alliance following Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise win: Nicolas Sarkozy crashed out of the primaries with only 20.6% of the vote. Shortly after his defeat he called on supporters to throw their weight behind Fillon. Among those who responded to the call were former prime minister and presidential candidate Edouard Balladur, and Sarkozy supporters Brice Hortefeux and Rachida Dati, as well as fellow first-round loser Bruno Le Maire. On the other hand, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morziet, who came fourth in the primary has announced she will support Jupp\u00c3\u00a9, as have former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and former minister Val\u00c3\u00a9rie P\u00c3\u00a9cresse. The other first round contenders, Jean-Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Cop\u00c3\u00a9, former head of the centre-right party, and Jean-Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Poisson of the Christian Democrat party, have yet to declare their second-round allegiance. Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Bayrou, the president of the centrist party MoDem, has already called for his supporters to vote for Juppe. The US stock market is expected to open calmly in 80 minutes time, as the Trump effect wears off: Francois Fillon hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got the Republican nomination sewn up quite yet. Having won yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first round contest, he must now beat Alain Juppe in a run-off next Sunday. That shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, given Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong showing in the primary: The scale of his victory has surprised many observers (perhaps because most people have been distracted by the US election!). So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve published a profile of Fillon, ideal for anyone muttering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFrancois who?!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning. It explains how the former PM is winning support with a neoliberal, conservative stance reminiscent of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tory party in the 80s. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Fillon, who beat his former boss Nicolas Sarkozy to join Alain Jupp\u00c3\u00a9 in the second round of voting for France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rightwing Republican party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential candidate, is a social conservative who likes drinking tea, driving classic cars and cutting state spending. The 62-year-old Paris MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign slogan to slash half a million public sector jobs over five years is inspired by his heroine, Margaret Thatcher. Of the seven Republican candidates, Fillon was the most outspoken defender of what is seen in France as the Anglo-Saxon economic model. He appears unafraid of offending the French statist tradition or fuelling a popular backlash against neoliberal economics. In his last rally before Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m tagged with an [economically] liberal label in the same way one would paint crosses on the doors of lepers in the middle ages. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just a pragmatist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fillon served as prime minister under Sarkozy, and is remembered for defying street protests and championing a rise in the retirement age. He tried to distance himself from Sarkozy after the 2008 financial crash by describing the country as bankrupt and suggesting France needed to cut state spending further. Opponents have questioned why he carried on serving as Sarkozy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister if he disagreed with his approach. Sarkozy was disdainful of Fillon as a presidential candidate, referring to him as one of his staff. But Fillon had the last laugh. By pipping him to the second round runoff next week, Fillon has all but ended Sarkozy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political career..... Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big three stock markets are all pushing higher as lunchtime approaches. European politics is the main issue in the City today, meaning concerns over Donald Trump can take a (temporary?) back seat. Investors seem to be welcoming the emergence of Francois Fillon as the man to lead the French right-wing Republican party to victory over Marine Le Pen of Front National next May. As explained earlier, Fillon is the favourite to become France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next president after beating fellow right-wingers Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is now up 35 points at 6810, a gain of 0.5%, led by mining companies. The French and German markets have posted similar gains (although Italy is still suffering from pre-referendum worries). Traders are hoping that Europe will stick with mainstream politicians in next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch elections, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The confirmation that Angela Merkel is set to run for a fourth term as German chancellor in next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, combined with a Marine Le Pen-damaging victory for Francois Fillon in the first round of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right-wing primaries, has given life to the euro this morning. The Eurozone currency finds itself up 0.2% against the dollar, just about lifting it away from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sub-\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.06 lows, while it has had more success against the pound, taking back nearly half a percent. The fact that this political news suggests stability in a region standing on the precipice of potential chaos has also helped out the Eurozone indices. French government debt have also strengthened in value this morning, pulling down the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year bonds. Newsflash: The Bank of England is considering raising the maximum bank deposit guaranteed in the UK to \u00c2\u00a385,000, from \u00c2\u00a375,000. The move is prompted by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump against the euro since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.30 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16. Under EU law, consumers can recover up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100,000 if they lose money when a bank collapses. And sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent decline has pushed up the value of that protection in pound terms. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority has concluded that the pound is not going to recover anytime soon: Taking into consideration the developments in financial markets following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum vote to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, including with respect to the GBP/EUR exchange rate, the PRA considers that a structural shift in the exchange rate has occurred. This may be a little embarrassing for the BoE. The limit was originally \u00c2\u00a385k, but the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulatory Authority decided to lower it to \u00c2\u00a375k in July 2015 (because the pound had rallied against the euro). That decision angered the high street banks, who had just trained their staff on the scheme. Tinkering with the deposit protection scheme too often risks confusing consumers... Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence also thinks Francois Fillon would beat Marine Le Pen in a straight race to become French president. Barroso says Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory over Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy in Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican primary is bad news for Le Pen: While left-wing voters would find it more difficult to support Fillon than Juppe in a second round, he is a less toxic candidate than Sarkozy; it is also likely that he would moderate his stance on economic issues between the two rounds in order not to scare off centrist voters. Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest strength is that he would be able to limit the potential flow of traditional conservative voters towards the FN [National Front]. In sum, the former PM would probably be able to deploy the necessary ambiguity to build a coalition of voters that could defeat Le Pen. The euro has gained almost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, as European political drama overtakes Donald Trump as the main issue on the trading floors. The single currency is trading at $1.063, up from $1.0585 on Friday night. That ends 10 days of straight declines following the US election. Traders are digesting Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to run for a fourth term as German chancellor, and Francois Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden promotion to favourite to become the next French president. Merkel has already warned that next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election will be tough, given the rising tides of populism: Fillon has campaigned on a conservative platform of cutting 500,000 civil service jobs and ending the 35-hour week. He also favours taking a hard line over Brexit, as our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin explains: Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success has raised hopes that National Front leader Marine Le Pen can be kept away from the presidency. But Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be complacent: The clearest message I received over the last two weeks was that opinion polls and historical voting patterns which suggest a le Pen victory is unlikely, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much to ease pre-election nervousness. Market participants can see the shift in the voter mood and the sharp swing in support for M Fillon can be seen as yet another surprise for opinion pollsters. Uncertainty will weigh on the Euro for months to come. City analysts are warning that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement will not be a game-changer, given the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems. George Palmer from Waverton Investment Management hopes that Phillip Hammond will announce new infrastructure spending plans. George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budgets and Autumn Statements were defined by a general intent to cut deficits, budgets and taxes on the entrepreneur. If Hammond is going to stimulate an economy that is entering a period of uncertainty it is unlikely that he will be able to cut all three. He has already abandoned the prospect of balancing the books and Wednesday 23rd will give us an idea on tax cuts. In line with Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises of improved infrastructure (not just walls) to provide growth and jobs, the expectation is that Mr Hammond will similarly spend the windfall of expanded deficits and unbalanced budgets on some sort of infrastructure. And arguably, there is capacity to do so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lack of investment (excluding the Olympics) since the Financial Crisis means its share of GDP has been falling steeply (as this chart shows): But Fiona Cincotti of City Index say Phillip Hammond hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got much flexibility to borrow more for investment: Given the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile, in addition to poor economic forecasts any expectations of Trump style spending are misplaced and he is likely to opt for a rather conservative budget in comparison. Sterling has seen a soft start to the week as Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking down of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post Brexit economy over the weekend has done little to support the battered currency; we are expecting to see more volatility in the lead up to and during the course of the Statement on Wednesday. And Edward Hardy of currency exchange firm World First points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position appears to be deteriorating: The size of Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal arsenal has been somewhat limited by new estimates forecasting a \u00c2\u00a3100bln black hole in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances due to slower growth and limited international investment attributed to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU. Despite the government ditching the pledge to balance the books by 2020, this lack of fiscal rigour will prevent Hammond, and any future governments, from enacting wider-reaching fiscal reform such as lifting the 1% public sector pay rise cap and revitalising public services. And She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off! Theresa May is telling the CBI conference that capitalism is the best hope for people struggling in the UK. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also challenging business to do more to help Britain, through long-term investment, helping communities and creating jobs for the next generation. May also declares that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambitious for business and ambitious for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Philip Hammond, she says, will commit to creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong and stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd basis for the economy, while also bringing the deficit down and cutting the national debt That may be a hint not to expect a major easing of fiscal policy this week. Stay tuned to Politics Live for more from the CBI.... The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference is up and running, and Theresa May should give the keynote speech in a few minutes. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is signalling that it may pull a sharp u-turn over plans to put workers on company boards. The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Theresa May is considering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwatering down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the plan, which was one of her early pledges when she replaced David Cameron in July. Business minister Greg Clark is now hinting that the government is indeed backing away from the plan (which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t popular with City bosses), telling Radio 4 that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May has talked about an economy that works for everyone - that includes workers, employees, consumers, the supply chain businesses - so we will put forward a series of ways in which those voices can be represented on boards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will publish those plans. We will have options. We are working with business. Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, head of the TUC, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has shed 1% in early trading as traders anticipate that voters will reject constitutional reforms in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The FTSE MIB has shed 160 points to 16,103, putting it on track for its weakest close since early July. The latest polls show that the public are likely to reject prime minister Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, to trim the Italian Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power and change the way its members are selected. Renzi has threatened to resign if he loses, which could plunge the eurozone into a fresh crisis (although he could yet lead a caretaker government). Social networking platform Facebook has given the UK economy a fillip, by announcing plans for a new headquarters in central London. The company is planning to hire 500 new workers, increasing its UK headcount by 50%, to work at the new site in Fitzrovia (the part of London around the BT Tower). Fingers crossed that this helps Facebook tackle its fake news problem.... Trump spent the weekend entertaining potential cabinet member at his New Jersey golf club. One \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcserious\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 option for the Secretary of State position is former presidential candidate Mitt Romney (who has presumably been forgiven for labelling Trump as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a phoney, a fraud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in March). These choices will be a litmus test for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration -- international investors will look for signs that the next president might row back from his anti-globalisation message. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, explains that politics will still drive the markets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll to have to take a view as to whether these people are pro free trade, or not as anti free trade as Trump sounded on the campaign trail, and what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to get in policies such as fiscal expansion and the dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After 12 days of shock, the City may have adjusted to the prospect of Donald Trump becoming the next US president. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are stubbornly, indeed disappointingly, quiet this morning as investors watch the billionaire president-elect form his new cabinet. Excited chatter about trillion-dollar infrastructure plans has faded, and anxiety over a bond market crash has eased too, while people wait to see how Trump prepares for power. So the pound is absolutely flat against the US dollar at $1.2345, and most government bond prices are inching a little higher. European stock markets are calm too, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index up 15 points in early trading. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success pushed the Dow Jones index to a series of record highs, and sent government bond prices reeling. But that initial wild reaction may now have faded, as FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The reflationary trade, or as some like to call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, probably led some big name bearish investors, who were calling the end of 8-year bull market to reconsider their judgments. Since Trump won the elections on November 9, the dollar index gained 3.6%, the Dow Jones traded at new record highs, and yields on U.S. 10-year treasury bonds rallied 25%. The shift in market sentiment was based on hopes that a Trump presidency means businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profits skyrocketing due to sharp cut in taxes, more capital expenditures, and finally some inflation supported by aggressive government infrastructure spending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to know how much further this bull can run especially that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driven by animal spirits, and yet no fundamental evidence. However, when everybody turns bullish, this is the time when you should get worried. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wet and gloomy in the City, as traders squelch to the office at the start of another busy week. The big event comes on Wednesday, when chancellor Phillip Hammond delivers the Autumn Statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first major set piece event since replacing George Osborne at the Treasury, and a chance to set the economy on its post-Brexit path. However, the omens aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. Yesterday, Hammond downplayed the chances of giving much help to struggling families, pointing out that the national debt was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eye-wateringly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd large. So hopes of a major infrastructure spending plan are already receding (although the chancellor may find \u00c2\u00a31.3bn for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roads). And after six years of Osborne-omics, we can see that those families at the bottom of the income pile have suffered badly. A new survey has shown that current austerity-driven welfare cuts will cost low-income working families more than \u00c2\u00a32,500 a year by 2020. Our front page story explains: A study of 187,000 households across the UK found that policies including cuts to universal credit and the four-year benefit rate freeze, coupled with rising rents and higher inflation, would see low-income working families typically lose \u00c2\u00a348.90 a week by the end of the decade. The findings have alarmed councils and charities worried that the growing financial burden on low-income families will raise poverty and homelessness levels. Also coming up today.... The impact of Brexit will be high on the agenda at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference in London today. Prime minister Theresa May is the keynote speaker, and will be talking about her plans for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A stronger, fairer Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 9.45am. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also speaking, along with many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top business leaders. Our politics team will be covering the CBI conference, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye for interesting titbits too. French politics took a twist last night when former PM Francois Fillon won the first round of the race to become the Republican party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidate for the presidency next year. Fillon is now the odds-on favourite to become the next president, and has probably sunk Nicolas Sarkozy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of a political comeback. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is presenting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report to MEPs in Strasbourg this afternoon. The oil price could be volatile, as producers prepare for an OPEC meeting at the end of this month. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic calendar to excite us, alas, so some traders are expecting a quiet day...",

This seems to have humoured the Eurozone consumer, who had been cautious through the summer months awaiting a negative Brexit response that has turned out to be mild so far.</p> <p>The question is whether this momentum can continue to build in the coming months though. While some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be maintained, there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth. As inflation is likely to continue to increase in the coming months, real wages will probably take a hit before nominal wage growth edges up again.</p> <p>And after a mild response to Brexit and the Trump election, will the Eurozone consumer respond more negatively to political uncertainty within the Eurozone? As a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the Italian referendum is ahead in the polls for the moment, it could well be that we will soon find out.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5834618de4b0e0ad2d75bf0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-22T15:19:16.758Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The improved eurozone consumer confidence figures bode well for future growth in the region, says Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHG Markit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a third month running in November - and markedly - to reach an 11-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone hare currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still very low inflation.</p> <p>This buoys hopes that the Eurozone is on course for improved GDP growth in the fourth quarter after expansion was limited to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. We currently expect fourth-quarter GDP growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter and believe that 0.5% expansion is a genuine possibility. However, we have significant concerns over the Eurozone growth outlook for 2017 amid an uncertain political outlook.</p> <p>While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in November was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased across the Eurozone after recently worsening. This was certainly true of both the Netherlands and Belgium, which have released their November surveys. Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in September after labour markets had shown signs of faltering.</p> <p>Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a marked increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58345ea1e4b0e0ad2d75beff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-22T15:09:56.426Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence beats forecasts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose by more than expected in November, despite the continuing uncertainties of Brexit.</p> <p>The initial estimate for the eurozone rose by 1.9 points to -6.1 points, better than the forecast -7.8 points.</p> <p>In the European Union as a while, confidence edged up by 0.7 points to -5.8.

                "bodyText":"Taking their cue from overnight records set on Wall Street, and boosted by further gains as US markets opened higher once more, European investors pushed shares higher once more. Despite dips in the oil price on renewed doubts about Opec agreeing output cuts next week, the prospect of a Trump boost to spending continued to support markets. In Europe, French and German markets were lifted once again by recent political developments - Francois Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the French presidential primary and Angela Merkel standing for a fourth term as German chancellor. As for the UK, the pound weakened ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement, but shares simply shrugged this off. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG,said: Ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement sterling remains weak, dropping back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs above $1.25. It is clear that the chancellor faces a difficult set of choices, with little wiggle room. Given the still murky path ahead for the UK economy, it is hard to see how Mr Hammond can do more than tinker around the edges. Markets will be watching closely for signs of concern about the economic outlook, which could see the pound weaken further against the dollar and the euro. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 41.76 points or 0.62% at 6819.72 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.27% to 10,713.85 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.41% at 4548.35 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 1.37% better at 16,519.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.43% at 8651.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.5% to 631.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 18980, having earlier surged past 19,000 to 19014. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting chart showing the moves in various commodities following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US election victory: Despite the better than expected eurozone consumer confidence figures, there is a chance the mood may not last, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Eurozone consumers have good reason to cheer in November. The oil price fell sharply at the start of the month and Eurozone stock prices have gained on the Trump victory. The unemployment rate has been flat over the summer months, but the employment outlook has been improving recently as companies are indicating to be hiring at a faster pace in both services and industry. This seems to have humoured the Eurozone consumer, who had been cautious through the summer months awaiting a negative Brexit response that has turned out to be mild so far. The question is whether this momentum can continue to build in the coming months though. While some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be maintained, there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth. As inflation is likely to continue to increase in the coming months, real wages will probably take a hit before nominal wage growth edges up again. And after a mild response to Brexit and the Trump election, will the Eurozone consumer respond more negatively to political uncertainty within the Eurozone? As a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the Italian referendum is ahead in the polls for the moment, it could well be that we will soon find out. The improved eurozone consumer confidence figures bode well for future growth in the region, says Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHG Markit: An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a third month running in November - and markedly - to reach an 11-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone hare currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still very low inflation. This buoys hopes that the Eurozone is on course for improved GDP growth in the fourth quarter after expansion was limited to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. We currently expect fourth-quarter GDP growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter and believe that 0.5% expansion is a genuine possibility. However, we have significant concerns over the Eurozone growth outlook for 2017 amid an uncertain political outlook. While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in November was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased across the Eurozone after recently worsening. This was certainly true of both the Netherlands and Belgium, which have released their November surveys. Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in September after labour markets had shown signs of faltering. Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a marked increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects. Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose by more than expected in November, despite the continuing uncertainties of Brexit. The initial estimate for the eurozone rose by 1.9 points to -6.1 points, better than the forecast -7.8 points. In the European Union as a while, confidence edged up by 0.7 points to -5.8. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: EU consumer confidence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been in positive territory for nearly two decades so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative reading is no surprise, but [ECB president] Mario Draghi will be pleased to see the above expectations data is at least moving in the right direction. Draghi deserves credit for maintaining a relatively stable eurozone economy at one of the most uncertain geopolitical times in memory. With the cloud of Brexit hanging over the future direction of the eurozone, in addition to volatile elections and referendums on the horizon that could add further uncertainty, holding firm is likely just what the doctor ordered. Some upbeat US economic news, with new home sales rising to their highest level in more than nine and a half years in October. The National Association of Realtors said sales rose 2% to an annual rate of 5.6m, with September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up from 5.47m to 5.49m. Analysts had expected a figure of 5.43m in October. Meanwhile the Richmond Federal Reserve composite manufacturing index came in at +4 in November, compared to -4 in October. The surge in US markets - based on the recent strength of the oil price and hopes that Donald Trumps infrastructure plans will boost the economy - is continuing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has breached 19,000 for the first time, touching 19007, before slipping back to 18,991, up 0.18%. Both the Nasdaq Composite - up 0.37% - and the S&amp;P 500 - 0.23% better - opened at new peaks. Over in the eurozone, and some good news from Portugal: The oil price has been rising in recent days on growing expectation that Opec might agree to limit output at its meeting next week, following an outline plan drawn up in Algiers in September. But as is always the case, it does not take much to dent the mood. Reuters is reporting that Iran, Iraq and Indonesia have doubts about the proposed output cut. So Brent crude, previously as high as $49.96m a barrel today is now down 0.59% at $48.61. And West Texas Intermediate is now down 0.56% at $47.97. 1) Britain is on track to blow past its budget forecasts for this year, despite cutting its borrowing in October by 25%. The UK has now borrowed \u00c2\u00a348.6bn since April 2016, down from \u00c2\u00a354.2bn a year ago, but already close to the \u00c2\u00a355bn target for this current financial year (to March 2017). Economists believe it could overshoot the target by \u00c2\u00a310bn or more, underlining the weak state of the public finances. The better news is that October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit fell to \u00c2\u00a34.8bn, from \u00c2\u00a36.4bn a year ago, thanks to a rise in corporation tax receipts. 2) UK families are more pessimistic about the long-term impact of leaving the EU. A new survey showed that confidence fell across all ages and income groups in the last three months. 3) British factories have reported a pick-up in orders, after a summer slowdown. However, many are also planning to hike prices to cover the slump in the pound. 4) The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline since June has wiped out $1.5trn of UK wealth, according to Credit Suisse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular report: Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is on track to close at its highest level since 10 November - the day after the US election. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a general rally in the markets today, as investors react to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close on Wall Street. Mining companies are still leading the charge, after Goldman Sachs announced that it is now bullish about commodity prices. That helped send the copper price up to a one-week high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are jumping on board the rally before New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market closes on Thursday for Thanksgiving: The week before Thanksgiving is never a good time to be short, since those of a bearish disposition tend to suffer a fate akin to a roasted turkey. Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to turn into commodity bulls has bolstered the London mining community, aside from precious metals miners, with the investment bank remaining downbeat on the outlook for gold. And the party could continue today, with the US markets expected to rise at the open (in about one hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time). British households have become more gloomy about the long-term economic consequences of leaving the European Union. Data firm Markit reports that 49.3% of people surveyed think Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook over the next decade has worsened due to the Brexit vote, while 31% of survey respondents think prospects have improved. That means Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of long-term pessimism index has dropped to -18.4%, compared to -11.1% in August and just -3.5% in July. However, people are a little more optimistic about short-term economic prospects; 12.4% of people expect the economy to fare better over the next six months, up from 11.8% in August. Markit also found that younger people are more pessimistic about the Brexit vote, while older people - who had initially been upbeat about the situation - are now less optimistic. And those with the lowest incomes have also become more anxious, having originally been the most optimistic about the impact of Brexit: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says people are concluding that Brexit will have a higher economic cost than they first thought: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On average, people have become considerably more pessimistic about the impact of the decision to leave the EU on the economy over the next decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only those working in manufacturing have become more upbeat about the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects, presumably seeing some benefit of the weaker pound in relation to boosting export performance. However, even here the number of people seeing Brexit to have boosted the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects over the next ten years only narrowly exceeds those expecting to see a negative impact. More details here. We have another gobbet of goodish news ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. British factory order books have improved to their best level since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey. 23% of manufacturers reported that their total order books are above normal, while 26% said they were below normal, giving a balance of -3%. This was above average, and back to the levels seen through the summer. It suggests the sector is stable, despite the uncertainty around Brexit. But the survey also shows that firms expect to hike prices in the next few months, following the slump in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value since the Brexit vote. Food and drink manufacturers are particularly affected. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overall order books at healthy levels, and the outlook for output growth remaining robust as we head into Christmas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the weak pound is beginning to make its mark, and prices are expected to rise, especially in the food and drink sector. On the flip side though, export orders remain above average. Bloomberg say today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Philip Hammond ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. But... it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spare the chancellor from announcing weaker growth and higher borrowing forecasts: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances: This chart highlights how Britain has made little progress in cutting the deficit this financial year: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that the pace of deficit reduction is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frustratingly slow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. He agrees that the UK government has fallen behind its deficit reduction plan, despite cutting borrowing by \u00c2\u00a31.6bn in October to \u00c2\u00a34.8bn. Beck says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stronger October outturn and some favourable revisions to prior months meant that borrowing was \u00c2\u00a35.6bn lower than a year earlier over the first seven months of fiscal year 2016-17. But this still leaves the Government behind schedule in terms of achieving the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full year forecast. If this trend continues over the remaining five months of the year then borrowing would overshoot by around \u00c2\u00a311bn. In reality the situation is probably a little less bleak, as forestalling associated with the pre-announced increase in dividend tax should cause a sharp rise in self-assessment income tax receipts in the first couple of months of 2017. But even allowing for this, Public Sector Net Borrowing (PSNB) looks set to come in some way above the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-year forecast of \u00c2\u00a355.5bn. Resolution Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Duncan Weldon has crunched the tax receipt data, and found that growth has tailed off a little: (Apologies, I initially posted the wrong tax receipt numbers in the 10.04am entry, so you might need to refresh) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total national debt has risen by \u00c2\u00a350bn over the last 12 months, and now stands at a decidedly lofty \u00c2\u00a31,641.6 billion pounds. But..... debt as a percentage of GDP has actually been falling for the last five months, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been growing slightly faster than the debt pile. The means the national debt is 83.8% of national output, down from 84.3% in October 2015. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances benefitted from a pick up in tax revenues last month, says the ONS. Central government receipts in October 2016 were \u00c2\u00a359.1bn, up \u00c2\u00a33.8bn (or 6.8%), compared with October 2015, says the ONS. October is traditionally a strong month for tax receipts, and last month saw a 9% spike in corporation tax receipts, which hit the highest level for any October since 2010, Bloomberg says. But income tax receipts dipped a little. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details of October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax receipts: Corporation Tax increased by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn, or 23.6%, to \u00c2\u00a39.0bn Interest &amp; dividends receipts increased by \u00c2\u00a31.0bn, or 33.9%, to \u00c2\u00a33.9bn Social (National Insurance) contributions increased by \u00c2\u00a30.6bn, or 6.4%, to \u00c2\u00a39.6bn VAT receipts increased by \u00c2\u00a3300m, or 2.8%, to \u00c2\u00a311.5bn Income Tax-related payments decreased by \u00c2\u00a3300m, or 2.4%, to \u00c2\u00a311.4bn Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon tweets that Britain is on track to borrow around \u00c2\u00a368bn this financial year -- much more than the \u00c2\u00a355bn which was predicted in March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Surely Philip Hammond will admit tomorrow that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit target will be missed? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances: Here we go! Britain borrowed less than feared last month, but is still on track to breach this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit target. Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a34.796bn in October, the ONS says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from \u00c2\u00a36.4bn in October 2015. That is rather better than the \u00c2\u00a36bn which the City expected [this excludes the impact of the taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stakes in the banking sector]. It means that Britain has now borrowed \u00c2\u00a348.6bn since April 2016 - down from \u00c2\u00a354.2bn in April-October 2015. So the deficit has dropped by \u00c2\u00a35.6bn so far this year, which means Britain is probably missing the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of a \u00c2\u00a355bn deficit for this financial year. This chart shows how much Britain has borrowed this year (the final orange line), and the final target for borrowing this financial year (the blue blob). More to follow! The weakness of the French economy continues to hurt Kingfisher. The DIY chain has reported a 3.6% slide in like-for-like sales during the last quarter in France, where it runs the Castorama and Brico D\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t chains. That took the shine off a 5.8% jump in comparable sales in the UK, led by its Screwfix arm. Kingfisher CEO V\u00c3\u00a9ronique Laury is trying to turn things around with a new efficiency plan. But the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, sending Kingfisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down 2%. George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that Laury will struggle: Previous Kingfisher bosses have tried and failed with similar plans, and just now trading conditions look challenging. UK builders merchants have reported tougher conditions, and the French economic outlook is uncertain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU destroyed $1.5trillion of wealth and cut the number of dollar millionaires in the UK by 15%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Credit Suisse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest wealth report, which highlights the impact of the 16% tumble in the value of the pound since June Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sullivan, chief investment officer in Credit Suisse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth management arm, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of the Brexit vote is widely thought of in terms of GDP but the impact on household wealth bears watching. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the Brexit vote, UK household wealth has fallen by $1.5tn. Wealth per adult has already dropped by $33,000 to $289,000 since the end of June. In fact, in US dollar terms, 406,000 people in the UK are no longer millionaires.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report also found that the richest % of people across the globe still own more wealth than the rest of the world put together - prompting development charity Oxfam to push the government to help the poorest in society. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale also expects that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances will show there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been little progress in eliminating the deficit this year. We look for a deficit excluding public sector banks of \u00c2\u00a36bn, a small fall from a year ago and a cumulative fall of just \u00c2\u00a32.3bn for the first seven months of the fiscal year compared to 2015/2016. This pace of improvement in the trend in public finances is disappointing relative to the resilience of the economy this year and limits the scope for any fiscal largesse going forwards. European stock markets have jumped at the start of trading, after the US market hit fresh record highs last night. In London the FTSE 100 index has risen by 50 points to 6828, up 0.75%. Mining stocks are leading, with Anglo American gaining 4.9% and BHP Billiton up 3.8%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC indices are both up around 0.6%, as investors catch up with a strong rally on Wall Street on Monday that drove all four indices to record levels. The prospect of a new splurge of US government spending is pushing shares higher, says FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed. There are clearly no signs of profit taking yet, with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflationary economic plans of cutting taxes, infrastructure spending and less regulations remain to be the number one reason fueling stocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gains. So much for those analysts who predicted a market crash if Trump became president. Even the news that Trump is now moonlighting as Nigel Farage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career advisor hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ended the rally..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement due tomorrow, investors will be particularly interested in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main event -- the UK public finances for October. Economists predict that Britain had to borrow around \u00c2\u00a36bn to balance the books last month, down from \u00c2\u00a36.4bn in October 2015. Any reduction in the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit is welcome, but this fall wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring the public finances back into line, given disappointing figures earlier in the financial year. Since April, Britain has already borrowed \u00c2\u00a345.5bn -- just \u00c2\u00a32.3bn less than a year earlier. That means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very little chance of hitting the old target of \u00c2\u00a355bn for the 2016-17 financial year, as this chart shows: September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances were a particular shocker, as Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reminds us: The public finances worsened appreciably in September compared to a year earlier. Specifically, Public Sector Net Borrowing excluding banks (PSNBex) amounted to \u00c2\u00a310.6 billion in September, which was up from a shortfall of \u00c2\u00a39.3 billion in September 2015. While the economy has shown overall resilience following June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, tax receipts have taken some hit. Indeed, corporation tax fell year-on-year in September. Chancellor Philip Hammond is already expected to tell MPs tomorrow that UK growth forecasts have been revised down, meaning Britain will borrow tens of billions of pounds more than expected over the next few years. Fiona Cincotta of City Index believes this bad news could easily drive up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs in the financial markets. In order to shore up the economy the government is expected to increase its borrowing, with upward revisions to net borrowing figures ranging from \u00c2\u00a38 billion to an extra \u00c2\u00a318 billion for 2017-18, taking the total to somewhere in the region of \u00c2\u00a363.5 billion - \u00c2\u00a373.5 billion. Should this amount be added to gilt issuance it would represent a significant increase which we would then expect to increase the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate at which it borrows. Therefore, any significantly large increase in future borrowing tomorrow from Hammond in his Autumn Statement, is likely to send the yields higher. [yields rise when prices fall, and show the effective interest rate on a bond] Also coming up.... The economics calendar is a little sparse, but we do get a new measure of eurozone consumer confidence and US home sales (both at 3pm GMT) Economists will be digesting the news that Donald Trump will pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day as president. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t calm fears that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into choppy waters of trade wars and protectionism. And in the City, food group Compass, retail chain Kingfisher, online electrical retailer AO World, pub chain Mitchells &amp; Butler and bank note maker De La Rue are all reporting results.",

The OBR expects GDP growth to be cumulatively 1.4pp lower over its forecast period to 2021. Consumer price inflation will be higher due to a weaker exchange rate. The OBR also believes potential growth in the UK economy will be lower due to a combination of lower assumed productivity and falling net migration.</p> <p>The official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on 23 June will have a negative impact on the UK economy and public finances, as lower growth translates to lower expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch says this justifies its decision to downgrade Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to AA, the second highest rating, after the referendum.</p> <p>The agency also welcomes Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to ditch the budget surplus target this parliament, and only try to get the deficit down to 2% of GDP.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think this increases medium-term fiscal flexibility, and the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest projections indicate that these new objectives will be met, and that the public sector debt ratio will peak in FY18. However, even if the public debt ratio peaks in the near term, any subsequent decline is likely to be slow, and the UK will still have one of the highest debt ratios among highly rated (AAA and AA) sovereigns.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58370001e4b0da4920d6bbbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-24T15:01:05.179Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can catch up with all the news, analysis and comment on the autumn statement here, in our comprehensive guide</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/24/guardian-autumn-statement-philip-hammond\">A guide to the Guardian's full autumn statement coverage</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5836fcb7e4b0da4920d6bbac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-24T14:48:36.175Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IFS has also highlighted that pensions are being relatively protected in the autumn statement....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801788323073314816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pensioners will feel earnings squeeze less, and more protected than working-age households when prices rise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AutumnStatement?src=hash\">#AutumnStatement</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XOlSZPc7Ik\">pic.twitter.com/XOlSZPc7Ik</a></p>&mdash; IFS (@TheIFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801788323073314816\">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>...while families on low incomes will be squeezed hard this parliament:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801791728789442560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Next few years will see benefits cuts for low-income working households on top of lower earnings and higher prices <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/autumnstatement?src=hash\">#autumnstatement</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/h1NBtcfF7E\">pic.twitter.com/h1NBtcfF7E</a></p>&mdash; IFS (@TheIFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/801791728789442560\">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5836e822e4b0e0ad2d75c8ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-24T13:20:08.175Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IFS is presenting<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/24/euro-low-german-slowdown-pound-italian-referendum-business-live?page=with:block-5836e6dbe4b0da4920d6bb3b#block-5836e6dbe4b0da4920d6bb3b\"> its autumn statement verdict</a> now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jack_Blanchard_/status/801775873435324416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IFS chief Paul Johnson confirms Hammond is basically following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edballs\">@edballs</a> economics now.

                "bodyText":"Thank goodness that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. The day after a UK budget or autumn statement is often quiet in the market, as political reaction tends to dominate. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been extra slow, thanks to our US cousins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 turkey-related activities. So European stock markets have sloped lazily to the close of play. The FTSE 100 finished 0.17% higher at 6829, with mining stocks among the risers but National Grid and easyJet both losing 2.3%. The smaller FSTE 250 shed 0.18% -- dragged down by Countywide, which shed 12.5% after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. But Dominos Pizza had a good day, finishing 3% higher after hiking its long-store expansion total to 1,600, from 1,200. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love affair with takeaway pizza clearly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. Elsewhere, Italy was the worst-performing major index -- worries over the constitutional referendum, and its banking sector, linger. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of German data didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move the markets much: The Eurozone indices were pretty drab this Thursday, the DAX and CAC managing a meagre 0.1% increase as the day went on. The impact of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measly 0.2% growth in Q3 seems to have been mitigated by a decent pair of business and consumer climate readings from the country; while they failed to improve month-on-month, the figures from the Ifo and Gfk at least suggest Germany wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bothered by the US election result. The good news, though, is that Friday should be more exciting; we get the second estimate of UK growth in Q3, plus Black Friday retail action. GW Rating agency Fitch has just declared that Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will suffer from the vote to leave the EU. In its first official reaction, Fitch says that the forecasts and spending plans outlined yesterday show that the task of bringing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts under control has become even harder. It also warned that Britain will suffer slower growth and weaker productivity if Brexit leads to new curbs on migrations (a point the OBR also made yesterday). Fitch says: The Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement underlines the challenges for the UK government to stabilise the public debt trajectory in the context of heightened economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote, Fitch Ratings says. Official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) point to a substantially lower path for economic growth compared to the pre-referendum projections underpinning the March budget. The OBR expects GDP growth to be cumulatively 1.4pp lower over its forecast period to 2021. Consumer price inflation will be higher due to a weaker exchange rate. The OBR also believes potential growth in the UK economy will be lower due to a combination of lower assumed productivity and falling net migration. The official forecasts appear consistent with our view that the vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on 23 June will have a negative impact on the UK economy and public finances, as lower growth translates to lower expected tax receipts and higher spending on transfers. Fitch says this justifies its decision to downgrade Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to AA, the second highest rating, after the referendum. The agency also welcomes Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to ditch the budget surplus target this parliament, and only try to get the deficit down to 2% of GDP. We think this increases medium-term fiscal flexibility, and the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest projections indicate that these new objectives will be met, and that the public sector debt ratio will peak in FY18. However, even if the public debt ratio peaks in the near term, any subsequent decline is likely to be slow, and the UK will still have one of the highest debt ratios among highly rated (AAA and AA) sovereigns. You can catch up with all the news, analysis and comment on the autumn statement here, in our comprehensive guide The IFS has also highlighted that pensions are being relatively protected in the autumn statement.... ...while families on low incomes will be squeezed hard this parliament: The IFS is presenting its autumn statement verdict now: Here we go... Workers in Britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a Brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tax and spending plans. Having picked over Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement, the IFS said real wages in the UK - pay adjusted for inflation - will still be below their 2008 level in 2021. Paul Johnson, the thinktank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, says its the worst squeeze since the 1930s: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One cannot stress how dreadful that is - more than a decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is the second dire warning of the day -- this morning, the Resolution Foundation warned that the living standards squeeze will actually worsen over the next five years. Newsflash: The Institute for Fiscal Studies is delivering its verdict on the autumn statement right now! And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stinker.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have full details in a moment... Shares in Countrywide Holdings have fallen to a record low after the estate agent hit investors with a profits warning. It admitted that sales in London have slumped by 29% in the last quarter, blaming the Brexit effect and the recent hike in stamp duty. This sent Countrywide shares sliding; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently down 12.5% at 169p, following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6% slide (due to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new clampdown on letting fees) Anyone who took part in Countrywide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market flotation in April 2013, at 350p per share, must be fuming. Countrywide itself fears that market conditions will stay tough; especially given the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Finance chief Jim Clarks says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one can really show them what the future is. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real lack of clarity on what post-Brexit Britain looks like.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Consumer confidence in Germany has inched up this month, according to the latest healthcheck from GfK. GfK reports that Germans are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more optimistic about overall economic prospects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and a little more willing to spend. That broadly matches the calm mood among business leaders this month (see earlier). But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a proviso.... the data was mainly collected before the US Presidential Election, so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see if Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory has caused any worries. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are showing all the verve and vigour of a Thanksgiving turkey today. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped by 24 points to 6793; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been bobbing around these levels for a couple of weeks now. Trading across the channel is just as languid - maybe traders are resentful that their US counterparts get the day off. Chris Beauchamp of IG blames American festivities for the lull: The usual Thanksgiving calm has descended across markets, as European investors reconcile themselves to a day of low volumes and quiet trading. With the US out of the picture currencies such as sterling and the euro have managed to recover and move higher, and while stock markets have recovered from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows there is still a sensation that there is not much more than hope to support valuations at current levels. This chart shows how German bosses have taken the triple-whammy of Brexit, Trump and lower growth in their stride this month. Newsflash from Ankara: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate to 8%, from 7.5%. The overnight lending rate has also been raised, to 8.5% from 8.25%. This looks like an attempt to prop up the Turkish lira, which has fallen to record lows against the US dollar recently. If so, it has done the trick - the lira has jumped by almost 1%. But it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who yesterday urged the central bank to cut borrowing costs. (weakening the lira) According to the FT, Ergodan declared: I am calling on lenders: please reduce interest rates to reasonable levels. Look at unemployment in the country. If we want growth, we need employment, investment and competition. Unemployment is above 11 percent; is this what this country deserves? The pound has crept to a two-month high against a basket of currencies today, helped by a 0.4% rise against the US dollar to $1.247. Traders continue to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement in their stride. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable really -- Philip Hammond abandoned the goal of eliminating the deficit this parliament, and the City just shrugged. The key message seems to be that investors actually like the idea of borrowing to invest -- if the alternative is growth-defeating austerity. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days -- especially as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt is heading over \u00c2\u00a31.9 trillion, or 90% of GDP. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says sterling looks vulnerable, The Autumn Statement saw more modest downward revisions to growth forecasts than expected, but the cumulative upward revision to the budget deficit path is GBP 122bn by 2020/21. That is more relevant for the Gilt market than for the pound, but there will be heightened concerns about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. A lower \u00c2\u00a3/$ exchange rate is likely The euro is bobbing around its lowest level against the pound since mid-September this morning, at around 84.8p (having hit 92p in October) David Swann, head of pricing at Travelex, says its a boon for anyone fancing a trip to a German market (and frankly, it looks more fun than Black Friday). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The euro is today at a 72 day low against the pound. This is good news for people planning a trip to Europe and businesses importing goods. People planning to buy their Christmas gifts at a European market can now get approximately 30 euros more when changing \u00c2\u00a3500 than they would have done three weeks ago. There is of course a negative impact on companies exporting goods and services to Europe, who will now be seen as more expensive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: German business optimism has dropped slightly, as corporate leaders watch Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US election victory. The IFO Institute reports that its business expectations index has dipped to 105.5 from 105.9 in October. But businesses also reported that trading has improved in November; sending IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current conditions up to 115.6 from 115.1 in October. This left IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main business climate index unchanged for the month. The slowdown in growth in the third quarter of 2016 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have hurt confidence. Indeed, IFO thinks that German growth could rebound to +0.5% in October-December, from 0.2% in April-June. IFO chief Clemens Fuest says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence in the German economy continues to be good The German economy seems to be unfazed by the election ofDonald Trump as U.S. president.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Hammond has just defended the Office for Budget Responsibility following criticism over its latest economic forecasts. Some pro-Leave campaigners aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that the independent watchdog has warned that Brexit will cost \u00c2\u00a358bn over the next five years. Hammond has been quizzed about it on the Today programme. This is from Andrew Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Liveblog: Q: Are you saying you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the OBR forecasts? The Telegraph says you take these forecasts with a pinch of salt. Hammond says forecasting is not a precise science. The OBR itself says there is a large degree of uncertainty. The government should not ignore these forecasts. It should include them in the range of possibilities for which it plans. It should not ignore the strengths of the economy. And it is right to keep something aside. Q: You seem to be distancing yourself from the forecasts. There is a wide degree of uncertainty, says Hammond. Q: So it may be tosh? Hammond says there are many factors causing uncertainty. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has given an early verdict on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme that: Philip Hammond has decided to spend more. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made a very clear choice about how he wants to spend more. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not given any more money to the NHS or social care, he has not unwound most of the cuts to benefit spending, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no jam today, but he has increased quite a lot - and this really is I think quite significant - he has increased infrastructure spending, spending on research and development as a way of investing in the economy and hoping that that in improves growth in the longer run. So he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investing in the future rather than helping people in the short term. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at about a 10% growth in investment spending, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at capital spending by the government close to or a little bit above actually what the Labour party was aiming for at the end of its period in office, before the financial crisis hit and the level of investment spending that we have here is well above the average for the last 30 years or so. So on all those measures, actually for once the reality comes close to matching the rhetoric. Investment spending has been relatively protected and these are quite big increases over the next five years. The IFS will give its formal response at lunchtime Bloomberg flags up that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has hit a one-year low: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth was supported by domestic demand last quarter as a slump in exports slowed the expansion to its weakest pace in a year. Government spending climbed 1% and private consumption rose 0.4% in the three months through September, while exports contracted 0.4%, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said on Thursday. Capital investment stagnated as spending on machinery fell. Gross domestic product rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.2% in the three months through September, in line with a November 15 estimate. We also have confirmation that Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2006. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slight slowdown on Q2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.8% growth, but much faster than the eurozone average of 0.3%. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to spend $1trn on rebuilding America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure is also pushing the euro down against the US dollar. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains: The prospect of fiscal largesse under a Donald Trump Presidency, and a multi billion stimulus plan, potentially as early as next year, is a key driver of the stronger dollar right now, as it could free up the Fed to hike interest rates in 2017 at a faster pace than most in the market (60%) think is likely. And that could possibly trigger wild swings in the bond market in 2017, if fiscal stimulus supplants monetary stimulus (ie, bond prices might fall, pushing borrowing costs higher). The euro has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since March 2015 in early trading. The single currency has dropped by 0.25% at the open to $1.052, a 20-month low. The confirmation that German growth slowed to just 0.2% in the last three months hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the euro. Traders are also getting anxious about next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian constitutional referendum; votes look poised to reject prime minister Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electoral reforms, which might trigger his resignation. But a currency trade has two sides, and the euro is also coming up against a resurgent dollar, as traders continue to bet on higher US interest rates and inflation. The markets now reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 100% chance that US interest rates will be hiked next month. Last night, the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting showed policymakers are confident that the US economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs soon. So the dollar is also at an eight-month high against the yen, and slightly higher against the pound at $1.242. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at Germany, with a string of economic data from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. New GDP figures have just confirmed that German growth halved to just 0.2% in the July-September quarter, in line with the initial estimate earlier this month. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detailed data shows that net trade dragged Germany back - wiping 0.3% off the growth rate. German exports fell by 0.4% during the quarter, suggesting a weakening in global trade, while imports rose by 0.2%. The figures would have been worse without state spending - which added 0.2% to the growth rate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to authorities investing to help migrants who have arrived in the country in the last year. Domestic spending also picked up, by 0.4%, showing that consumers spend more in the shops -- understandably, given that German unemployment is at a record low. So, some of this data is quite encouraging, given the loud calls for Germany to boost consumption to help the wider euro economy. But the drop in exports is a worry. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, comments: The German economic data released today has shown that domestic demand has picked up during the third quarter- a sign of improving demand. Having said that the German final GDP number came in line with the forecast of 0.2%. More encouraging signs were in the public spending and construction investment. Given that Germany is very much export based economy, and the export number dropped by 0.4%, it shows that global growth is still weak. Two more surveys should help us see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on: 9am GMT: German IFO survey of business confidence Noon GMT: German GfK consumer confidence survey Also coming up today: The financial markets may be quiet, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving in America. City traders should still be digesting yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK autumn statement, and the news that Britain will be borrowing \u00c2\u00a3122bn more than previously planned over the next five years. The pound actually rallied yesterday, after chancellor Philip Hammond tore up the old goal of fiscal consolidation and pledged to borrow to invest. Paresh Davdra of RationalFX says investors like the sound of Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new direction for post-Brexit Britain, with an emphasis on investment in infrastructure, housing, and boosting the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. The pound rose slightly during the announcement, with high value investments such as funding local growth in the north and midlands, as well as funds for innovation and productivity, striking a positive note with the markets. However this optimism did not last long as the uncertainty that still remains over the future of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy due to Brexit still appears too great for the pound to escape. Today the IFS thinktank gives its verdict on Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Our Politics team will probably take the lead, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll watch for financial reaction. On the corporate news front, Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza, Mothercare and estate agent Countrywide are all reporting results.",

                "bodyText":"The Bank of England is pushing ahead with plans for transitional arrangements after Brexit negotiations in an attempt to protect financial institutions from a cliff edge deal that could undermine their stability. Governor Mark Carney has met senior figures in the City to stress the need for a smooth path out of the European Union that maintains its stature and strong links with the continent. The meetings followed his submissions to the Treasury select committee that outlined his view that banks and other financial institutions would need to be given time to put new rules in place after a deal had been struck with Brussels. The Confederation of British Industry and the British Bankers Association have lobbied No 10 and No 11 to impress on the prime minister and chancellor that transition arrangements would be needed or firms could face a barrage of new tariffs and trading relationships. Banks are concerned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passporting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd agreements that allow transactions to flow across border uninterrupted could be scrapped or modified as part of the Brexit negotiations, denying them easy access to customers inside the single market. Brexit supporters cast Carney as a member of an elite that will campaign behind the scenes by placing administrative roadblocks in the way of a quick exit. But Threadneedle Street has emphasised that it respects the result of the referendum vote and merely wants to protect a vital sector of the economy from unnecessary harm after article 50 talks. Carney was facing criticism for spending almost \u00c2\u00a3100,000 of taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual summer party, just weeks after the Brexit vote.

The difference is material for an OPEC cut as it amounted to 215 thousand b/d in October and in recent months the gap has swelled to 300 thousand b/d. (As <em>Platts</em> has reported, Baghdad appears to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"http://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2016/110416/no\">double-counting</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd some oil that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produced inside Kurdish-controlled territory.)</p> <p>OPEC is reportedly aiming for a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting-nigeria-idUSKBN13H0SD\">production cut target</a> of 4.5 percent. 4.5 percent of Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em>claimed </em>output is equal to the gap between the higher official number and the lower secondary sources estimate. So if Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand possibly inflated\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproduction number is the baseline for a cut, then Iraqi production might only be frozen at around 4.5 million b/d. No barrels would come off the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>The position with Iran is even less clear, Reed says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Iran represents a real challenge because its messaging has been so confused in the weeks leading up to the Vienna meeting. At home, when speaking to a domestic audience, Iranian officials have claimed higher production levels than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reported to OPEC. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve even claimed that volumes today are higher than at any time since the Shah ruled Iran.</p> <p>Statements like these should raise eyebrows when all year Iran has said it would not consider freezing or cutting output until production reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-sanctions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levels, presumably those that prevailed in the mid-2000s.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. 1) ECB chief Mario Draghi has urged the UK government to provide clarity on its plans to exit the European Union. Draghi believes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently impossible to say what impact Brexit will have on the City, or the rest of Europe, due to the lack of information from London. He told the European Parliament that: We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, before we can actually express our views on this. 2) Draghi also warned that Britain would suffer most from a hard break from the EU: If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and potential output \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the U.K. economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 3) The oil price has jumped, on hopes that Opec will hammer out the details of a plan to cut output at their meeting in Vienna this week. Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Jabar Ali al-Luaibi, dodged a broken vase to tell eager reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are optimistic. We hope we (will) have agreement. We will cooperate with OPEC members to reach agreement acceptable to all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But some experts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the cartel can put its recent tensions behind; will Iraq and Iran really commit to production curbs, or just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfreeze\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their current levels? Saudi Arabia has taken a tough line this week, cancelling a meeting with Russia and suggesting that output curbs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t essential. Analysts believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all part of a negotiating strategy to get Iran and Iraq, among others, onside. Brent crude is now up 2.6% at $48.49, ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch meeting. But more volatility is expected, as ministers and reporters congregate in a chilly Vienna. 4) The OECD has predicted that the global economy could benefit from Donald Trump. The Paris-based thinktank raised its growth forecasts, and suggested that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for higher government spending and a huge infrastructure project could help world growth. But it also warned that protectionism could hold back world trade. 5) European stock markets have closed in the red, with the FTSE 100 dropping by 40 points or 0.6%. Retail stocks were among the fallers, with Next losing 2.6% and Burberry down 1.9%. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Retailers seem to have a bad case of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCyber Monday blues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, following from a Black Friday that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even try to live up to the hype. Could it be that, having shopped for Britain in the wake of Brexit, UK consumers are now reining in their spending? The French and German markets both shed around 1%, while Italy lost 1.8% as fears grow over Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Paresh Davdra, CEO of City firm RationalFX, says Mario Draghi may be losing patience with politicians....after years of propping up economic growth: He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ECB President Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech this afternoon before MEPs saw him stress the importance of reform in the governance of the Eurozone. Whilst maintaining that ECB stimulus has helped recovery in the Eurozone, his call for greater input from policymakers to help growth will likely reignite the debate over the role of central banks in both the EU and the UK. With a decision on further QE on the agenda for early next week, there is a good chance his warning is in reference to the uncertainty that the Italian Referendum and the French and German elections will bring in the new year. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments likely reflect a frustration that BoE governor Mark Carney will be able to relate to, in which central banks have to fulfill certain roles that policymakers traditionally undertook in order to keep the economy stable. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs comments on Brexit further acknowledge this, in his call for Prime Minister Theresa May to share more about the Brexit strategy days after it was revealed Carney was involved in contingency planning in the case of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Whilst it is likely that further uncertainty awaits the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy before the end of the year, markets will be watching to see if Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wish for more than just stimulus measures to help boost the Eurozone will be answered.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: One of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers is defending the central bank against criticism of its loose monetary policy. Gertjan Vlieghe is telling an audience in Sheffield University that UK interest rates are at record lows because the global economy is facing disinflationary forces. Not the other way round. Vlieghe takes a weather analogy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been raining, so we have all opened our umbrellas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not convinced by critics who argue that low rates are causing economic woes... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Umbrellas together with rainfall are observed in many countries. Nobody actually believes that umbrellas cause rainfall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And he also points out that central banks which raised interest rates since the financial crisis ended up having to cut them again (such as the European Central Bank). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had several low interest rate, low inflation countries that have raised interest rates over the past decade. This was not followed by an escape from the alleged confidence trap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Higher interest rates, far from boosting demand and inflation, have caused growth to slow and inflation to fall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of these countries now have even lower short term and long term interest rates than the UK, as inflation expectations have drifted lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vlieghe also takes a pop at those who say savers are suffering from low interest rates - pointing out that savers often own the kind of assets whose value has been pushed by by loose monetary policy. Sky New\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Faisal Islam thinks Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are significant: Bloomberg have a good take on Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be the first to suffer if its decision to leave the European Union leads to protectionist measures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If, in the long run, the risk of a less-open U.K. economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialize, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and potential output,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi said in testimony to European Parliament lawmakers in Brussels on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the U.K. economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd British Prime Minister Theresa May says that by March she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll formally announce Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention to leave the EU, triggering at least two years of potentially contentious talks between Brussels and London. Her government could be forced to choose between remaining in the EU single market and regaining control over immigration. Now a question for Mario Draghi about this Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum in Italy. Q: Could a country leave the euro against its own wishes, as a result of a referendum? And are eight Italian banks at risk, as reported in the UK and Italy, if the No campaign wins? Draghi declines to answer, and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate about either question. Q: But we have a business newspaper (the Financial Times) saying Italy could leave the euro following this referendum. Surely you have a view? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to comment on other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, on other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s articles, Draghi insists. [I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about Wolfgang M\u00c3\u00bcnchau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s column, last Monday. It argued that investors might lose faith in Italy if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his bid to reform the Italian senate, and resigns.] Another question about Donald Trump, this time about his infrastructure spending plan.... Q: If the German government came up with a similar infrastructure plan in 2017, after the next federal elections, would it get the ringing endorsement of the ECB? Draghi says that public investment has fallen in the last 15 years. Increasing public investment has benefits, and can create higher potential outlook if it is well-targeted. In the past, some public investment was simply wasted, Draghi adds -- so any infrastructure spending plan has to be well-designed to boost growth. Q: Are you worried that Donald Trump might replace Janet Yellen as head of the US Federal Reserve? Draghi says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not privy to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking with respect to the Fed. But he suggests the president-elect should tread carefully: Undermining independence of central banks is not in anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests, especially those in the jurisdiction of the central bank. During the election campaign, Trump criticised the Fed for keeping interest rates too low, and suggested he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018. Another MEP asks Draghi for his views on the fiscal plans announced by chancellor Philip Hammond last week (which included \u00c2\u00a3122bn of fresh borrowing, and new spending on infrastructure). Draghi says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough knowledge to assess the impact of Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan on the eurozone. But any impact will inevitably be contained within the UK, given the difference in size between Britain and the eurozone. Mario Draghi has urged Theresa May to give British citizens more information about her plans for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. The European Central Bank president told MEPs in Brussels that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in the dark about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy. Asked if Britain will lose its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the EU, or if jobs will be shed in the City, Draghi says the lack of clarity means he simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. He tells the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee (livefeed) that: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. And the reason we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know is we have to see exactly how the final shape of the negotiations will be, and how long they will last. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty clear that the longer they last, the bigger the uncertainty. Draghi also tells MEPs that over recent years, the City of London has achieved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the highest economies of scale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for any financial services industry apart from New York. Brexit puts all this up in the air, Draghi says: Now, how will this change, We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Will this be recreated somewhere else? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Would the considerable benefit that these economies of scale have created to the European Union, to the United Kingdom, be recreated elsewhere? Or will there be a migration to the United States? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. And the ECB chief concludes his answer by putting the ball firmly in the British government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court: We are also looking for a concept by the UK government where it would share its views and plans with its own citizens, and see what they say about that, before we can actually express our views on this. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come a day after it emerged that Bank of England governor Mark Carney is pushing for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitional arrangements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to protect the City from a hard Brexit. And in another twist, lawyers have launched a fresh legal challenge over whether Britain should seek to retain membership of the single market during the Brexit process. Mario Draghi says the ECB will decide next month whether to extend its QE stimulus programme: Draghi was also asked about Donald Trump; he says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too soon to know how the president-elect will affect monetary policy. On Brexit, Draghi says that the eurozone has weathered the fallout from the UK referendum outcome with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153encouraging resilience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But he cautions that the UK economy is expected to slow, as firms cut investment. Draghi also refuses to allow Brexit to undermine the European single market, While the UK referendum did create uncertainty as far as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation in the Single Market is concerned, the Single Market cannot go backwards. It is imperative that its integrity and the homogeneity of rules and their enforcement will be preserved. This also means we cannot take backward steps concerning the regulatory,supervisory and oversight framework for banks and financial market infrastructures, which has been enhanced considerably since 2008. Mario Draghi has urged European leaders not to abandon economic and monetary union as they wrestle with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new security challenges. The head of the European Central Bank began his session in Brussels by telling MPs that the euro area economy is growing at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a moderate but steady pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite economic and political uncertainties. And he warns that policymakers need to shore up the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creaking foundations. I am aware that the attention of our policymakers has shifted. In the direct aftermath of the financial crisis the need to complete Economic and Monetary Union came to the forefront of the European debate. Since then circumstances have changed. Today Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is more on security. Both projects require Europe to be united \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to act together. However, let us not forget that Europe will be better able to protect itself if it has a strong and resilient economy. And for that purpose, Economic and Monetary Union must overcome the vulnerabilities stemming from its incompleteness. One important lesson from the crisis is that a half-built house is not stable, it is fragile. Draghi also cites the recent Five Presidents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report - which recommended closer fiscal union (tighter control of member states\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 budgets by Brussels), and a Europe-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme. Over in Brussels, ECB chief Mario Draghi is taking his seat to take questions from the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committe on economic and monetary affairs. You can watch it live here. Monetary Dialogue with Mario DRAGHI, President of the European Central Bank I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye for any major developments This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is the first opportunity for Opec oil ministers to discuss the implications of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory. The president-elect could dramatically change the rules of the energy industry, and not to Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advantage either. Trump has repeatedly criticised environmental regulations, saying they make it harder for US oil producers to compete and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killing jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. During the campaign, he promised help for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry, and for coal mines too. This could all make it harder for Opec to push the oil price up towards $60 per barrel, as my colleague Debbie Carlson explains: News reports suggest Saudi Arabia may have the support from key members like Iraq and Iran, and even support of non-Opec member Russia to cap production. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for US oil production will hang over talks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think they [Opec] are terribly concerned about it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest concern the Saudis have is: what if the US encourages these companies to drill too soon and that puts another 500,000 barrels on the [already oversupplied] market, say 12 months from now? That could really weigh on prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Cohen, analyst at Barclays, agreed that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election put Opec in a tough spot. It may make it harder for the cartel to come to an agreement because of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign rhetoric on scuttling the Iran nuclear deal and pledges for US energy independence. ABN Amro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hans van Cleef shows how the oil price has already been buffeted by rumours from Vienna, even before the main meeting even begins (on Wednesday): The oil price has jumped, as traders welcome the Iraqi oil minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoptimism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about a deal this week. Brent crude just spiked by 1% to $47.75 per barrel, its highest point of the day, after Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said Iraq would co-operate with other Opec members this week. We should be cautious -- oil is still below Friday morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels, before Saudi started hinting that it might not cut production after all. And this optimism may not survive Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meting. Breaking news! A vase has been sent tumbling in Vienna as oil reporters rushed to speak with Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister as he arrived at the Opec meeting. Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told the expectant, and clumsy, throng that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that a deal will be reached on Wednesday. No details though. I fear that the vase may not be fixable: When not demolishing expensive club sandwiches, oil reporters are mainly hanging around Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plush foyer waiting for cartel bigwigs to arrive: Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditors, Grant Thornton, could be in hot water over the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company, Barlin Delivery (as flagged earlier). My colleague Rob Davies explains: A small FRC team of two or three investigators will look into Grant Thornton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in failing to report the nature of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Barlin. If investigators determine that Grant Thornton did not do its job properly, it could be hit with anything from a public reprimand to a sizeable fine. Opec attendees should take their best winter woolies -- conditions are getting frostier in Vienna..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason why Iran is reluctant to cut supply: Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to agree an output cut this week faces many hurdles. One is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear how much oil Iraq and Iran are actually pumping -- so what is billed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccut\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 might actually only be a freeze. Matthew Reed of Energy Fuse explains why: Iraqi officials claim all of Iraq, including Kurdish territory, is producing 4.776 million b/d, when secondary sources estimate that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producing 4.561 million b/d. The difference is material for an OPEC cut as it amounted to 215 thousand b/d in October and in recent months the gap has swelled to 300 thousand b/d. (As Platts has reported, Baghdad appears to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double-counting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd some oil that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produced inside Kurdish-controlled territory.) OPEC is reportedly aiming for a production cut target of 4.5 percent. 4.5 percent of Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claimed output is equal to the gap between the higher official number and the lower secondary sources estimate. So if Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand possibly inflated\u00e2\u20ac\u201dproduction number is the baseline for a cut, then Iraqi production might only be frozen at around 4.5 million b/d. No barrels would come off the market. The position with Iran is even less clear, Reed says: Iran represents a real challenge because its messaging has been so confused in the weeks leading up to the Vienna meeting. At home, when speaking to a domestic audience, Iranian officials have claimed higher production levels than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reported to OPEC. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve even claimed that volumes today are higher than at any time since the Shah ruled Iran. Statements like these should raise eyebrows when all year Iran has said it would not consider freezing or cutting output until production reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-sanctions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levels, presumably those that prevailed in the mid-2000s. Simply put: Iran can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t claim victory and ignore OPEC. This disconnect isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily disingenuous either. If you count crude oil and lighter condensates, the case can be made that Iranian production is at its highest level in decades. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Fleet Street expense departments must really love the Opec meetings, judging by this tweet from the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Sheppard: Italian banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only ones facing problems, as Associated Press reports: The troubles at Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank by assets, state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos, are deepening as its new president and six board members have quit less than three months after starting work. The resignations come amid a dispute over a law demanding that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior officials make public their income and personal assets. The departures are at a sensitive time as the government readies a 5.1 billion euro ($5.4 billion) rescue plan for the bank. Caixa Geral de Depositos informed financial regulators of the developments Monday. The government says the rescue will proceed as planned next year. Analysts say poor lending practices and unpaid loans are to blame for financial difficulties at Caixa Geral de Depositos and in the Portuguese banking sector generally. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technical meeting is now in full swing: Back in the UK, Tata Steel UK has moved close to selling its Speciality Steels business to fellow steelmaker Liberty House, for \u00c2\u00a3100m. Tata says it has sighed a letter of intent to sell the operations, which employ around 1,700 people making steel for aerospace, automotive and oil and gas companies. It includes three sites in Yorkshire -- a steelwork at Rotherham, a steel purifying facility in Stocksbridge, Sheffield, and a mill in Brinsworth, near Rotherham -- plus service centres in Bolton and Wednesbury. The oil price has just bounced back from its earlier losses. Brent crude is now up 0.3% at $47.38, having shed more than 1% earlier. Traders are watching Vienna closely for signs of a breakthrough, as Opec officials hold today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technical meeting. Oil may also be benefitting from the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic forecasts, predicting faster growth in most major economies. The OECD is also optimistic that America will drive global growth, thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more supportive fiscal stance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It says: In the aftermath of the US elections, there is widespread expectation of a significant change in direction for macroeconomic policy. And in practice, that means more government spending, and cuts to personal and corporation tax: An increase in government consumption and government investment each worth \u00c2\u00bc per cent of (baseline) GDP in 2017 and 2018. A reform to personal income taxes that reduces tax revenue by around \u00c2\u00bd per cent of GDP in 2017 and 2018. In practice this is likely to include some reductions in the number of personal income tax brackets as well as some reduction in marginal rates. Reforms to corporate taxes that reduce revenues by around \u00c2\u00be per cent of GDP in 2018. In the simulation this is assumed to arise from a reduction in the baseline effective corporate tax rate of just over 10%, rather than from an expansion in the tax base. But the OECD is also concerned that world trade growth has been weak since the financial crisis: Trade enhances competitive pressures, enables greater specialisation and improved resource allocation, facilitates knowledge transfer and is essential for the functioning of global value chains. And here are the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts Newsflash: The OECD has warned that the world economy will struggle to escape its long period of low growth unless governments take advantage of low interest rates to invest more. In its new global outlook, just released, the OECD also predicts the UK economy will be hit by Brexit uncertainty next year and grow just 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recession. My colleague Katie Allen explains: In its first in-depth forecasts since Donald Trump won the US election on an anti-globalisation platform, the west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading economic thinktank warns a new wave of protectionism and trade tensions risks denting global growth, stoking inflation and harming living standards. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said it was optimistic that expected spending measures and tax cuts under the new US administration will would boost growth there and in other countries. But it warned that global trade growth was already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptionally weak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that jobs would suffer if politicians rolled back the clock on trade liberalisation. It forecasts that, after averaging 3.9% growth over the decade to 2013, global growth would be 2.9% for this year then edge up to 3.3% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Almost a decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis, the global economy remains in a low-growth trap with weak investment, trade, productivity and wage growth and rising inequality in some countries,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Catherine Mann, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monetary policy is overburdened, leading to growing financial risks and distortions. Alongside structural reforms, a stronger fiscal policy response is needed to boost near-term growth and strengthen long-term prospects for inclusive growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report noted that more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand in many of the 35 countries in the OECD group. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This economic outlook suggests that protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade protectionism shelters some jobs, but worsens prospects and lowers wellbeing for many others,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the report said. The warning comes days after the US president-elect announced his intention to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. At its last forecasts in September, the OECD backtracked on its earlier warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from the Brexit vote. In this new outlook, the thinktank now forecasts UK GDP would have grown 2.0% this year, a touch higher than the 1.8% it predicted in September. The forecast for next year was lifted to 1.2% from 1.0% in September. But that would still be the weakest growth since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 and is slower than the 1.4% forecast by the Bank of England and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It noted Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement to abandon the strict borrowing rules of his predecessor, George Osborne, but urged the new chancellor to go further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For the eurozone, the OECD predicts growth will remain subdued with some impact from the Brexit vote in the UK, a key trade partner for the single currency bloc. Within the eurozone, Greece is expected to return to modest GDP growth next year, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is forecast to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is seen increasing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradually\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the outlook - written before Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Fillonwon the primary race on Sunday to become the French right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential candidate - said next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounting watchdog has launched an investigation into Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial statements. The probe centres on Barlin Delivery Limited, the company owned by the brother of Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder Mike Ashley. It emerged in August that Sports Direct was using John Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firm to deliver goods to overseas companies. And the FRC is now investigating whether this arrangement should have been disclosed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: Investigations into the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of Sports Direct International plc The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has commenced investigations under the Accountancy Scheme and the Audit Enforcement Procedure in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of the financial statements of Sports Direct International plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) for the 52 week period ended 24 April 2016. These decisions follow reports of an arrangement between Sports Direct and Barlin Delivery Limited which was not disclosed as a related party in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial statements. JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil team have predicted that oil could fall back below $40 per barrel if Opec doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to curb oil output: Italian bank shares have hit an eight-week low this morning, in a bout of pre-referendum jitters. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson explains why: UniCredit and Banca Popolare di Milano are down 4%, while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is down 7% as it kicks off a debt-to-equity conversion ahead of its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn recapitalisation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a key moment for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks. Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on constitutional reform is Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit moment and a No vote would send tremendous shockwaves through the markets and the banking system. It could also heap pressure on the euro. Already crushed post-Trump, the euro could hit parity with the dollar if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in the Eurozone could be doubt. Back in Vienna, officials from Opec countries have gathered for technical talks ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: European stock markets have all fallen in early trading, amid worries over Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to agree output cuts this week. The FTSE 100 index has fallen by 61 points, or 0.9%, to 6779, dragged down by oil producers. Shares in Royal Dutch Shell have dropped by over 2%, while BP has shed 1.5%. Both companies Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough talk ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is worrying the City, explains Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets: OPEC officials said Saudi Arabia won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attend a prep meeting today with Russia and others ahead of the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official meeting even going as far as to suggest the group doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need necessarily to curb output. Here we go. Buckle up. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is the worst performer this morning, being dragged down by its banks. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to worries over Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on constitutional reforms, and anxiety over Monte dei Paschi di Siena -- the troubled Italian lender, which is running a debt-for-equity swap today as part o f its rescue deal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just two decrees Celsius in Vienna right now, where the temperature matches the chilly relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Javier Blas has defied the cold to tweet: The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Georgi Kantchev reports that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism in Vienna that output cuts will be finalised But Amena Bakr, Energy Intelligence Group correspondent, is cautious: Forbes energy expert Ellen Wald reckons Saudi Arabia is playing hardball with Iran ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to meet with non-Opec members today, and its hint that output cuts may not be needed, are all part of a strategy to make Iran take part in output cuts. As Walt puts it: Though these statements may appear to indicate an about-face in Saudi policy, they are in fact a negotiating tactic. Saudi Arabia is prepared to walk away from a deal if OPEC cannot reach an agreement and Saudi Arabia will not make any additional concessions. Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest Opec preview has more details: OPEC Meeting Preview: New Drama Unfolds The oil price is weakening in early trading, as traders fret that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OPEC meeting won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yield an agreement to cut output. Brent crude has lost 0.75% to $46.91 per barrel, adding to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% slide. And US crude has dropped a similar amount, to $45.72 per barrel. However, some experts believe Opec will hammer out some kind of output cut -- as failure would sent prices down even further. Oystein Berentsen, managing director for crude at oil trading firm Strong Petroleum in Singapore, told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An agreement is needed to avoid (price) downside. So, the question is what kind of agreement will they do? The market is clearly very nervous... We shall see. I think they will reach some form of agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tension is building in the markets today ahead of a crunch meeting of oil producers in two day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Vienna has long been inked in as the moment when OPEC members would finally put their differences aside and agree detailed output cuts. But late on Friday, Saudi Arabia threw everything up in the air, by pulling out of a scheduled meeting today with non-OPEC oil producing countries including Russia. And Saudi Arabia has now added to the drama, by hinting that supply curbs may not be needed after all. Khalid Al-Falih, the Saudi oil minister, declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect demand to recover in 2017, then prices will stabilize, and this will happen without an intervention from OPEC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a single path which is to cut production at the OPEC meeting, we can also depend on recovery in consumption, especially from the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those comments are being interpreted as a hint that Opec might not, after all, sign off on its first production decrease in eight years this week. Back in September, they agreed the outline of a deal, but no details over who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually cut what. Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO, suggests Wednesday could become another Opec damp squib. The oil price fell sharply on Friday after Saudi pulled out of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Russia, and is under further pressure this morning.... Also coming up today.... The OECD is publishing its latest Global Economic Outlook at 10am, which will include forecasts and analysis of 35 of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economies. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi will be quizzed by MEPs today, when he testifies to the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, from 2pm GMT. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll then swap hats, and take questions from the same committee in his role as the Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Draghi can expect some criticism of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programmes, plus questions about Brexit, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, and the Italian banking sector. Investors will also be watching Italy, as we enter the final straight before Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on constitutional reforms. Prime minister Matteo Renzi seems to be heading towards defeat, which could prompt a new bout of eurozone crisis drama.",

                "bodyText":"OK, time for a brisk recap. 1) America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing even better than expected; growth in the last quarter has been revised up to a 3.2% annual rate, from 2.9%. Consumer spending, investment and exports all helped to push GDP up. Analysts say the figures show the US is in fairly robust shape, making a December interest rate rise even more likely. 2) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadlock in Vienna tonight, as Opec ministers struggle to make headway towards a deal to cut production. Iran has thrown down the gauntlet, saying it will not reduce its output and suggesting Saudi Arabia takes the hit itself. The oil price has slumped by 3.5% tonight, as the markets prepare for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. 3) Investors are bracing for volatility as Italy heads to the polls on Sunday to vote on PM Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional reforms. ECB sources have hinted that they would use their QE programme to stabilise the markets on Monday, if the public vote No -- a move that could prompt Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. Adam Chester, head of economics for commercial banking at Lloyds Bank, predicts turbulence if Renzi loses (as seems likely): Italy is being asked whether to accept a broad package of measures aimed at making the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gridlocked political system more efficient and its government more stable. It has had more than 60 governments since the Second World War, so one might think that measures to improve stability would be strongly welcomed. But a key implication of the proposed changes is that incumbents would have far more power, which is strongly resisted by opposition parties, and there is a clear risk that the people will vote against the government, particularly given the weakness of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. If the referendum is not passed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the polls suggest a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 win \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Prime Minister Renzi could step down, leading to early elections and boosting the anti-EU Five Star Movement (M5S), which has pledged a referendum on whether Italy should stay in the euro. If Italy votes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the euro is likely to come under immediate downward pressure and contagion could also see government bond and credit spreads across much of Europe rise. 4) Companies have been teaming up with charities for Giving Tuesday: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Tomorrow will be extra-busy, with Bank of England stress test results released at 7am GMT, and Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting running through the day. See you then. Goodnight! GW Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has defied worries about Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum to close 2% higher. The FTSE MIB index outperformed the rest of Europe, helped by that Reuters report that the ECB would step in to stabilise the markets next week, if needed. The German, French, and Spanish indices also finished the day higher, But the FTSE 100 lost 27 point, or 0.4%, to finish at 6772 - dragged down by energy companies including BP (-2.1%) and Shell (-2%). City traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been impressed by the lack of progress at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Vienna today: Joshua Mahoney of IG says: Despite an initial consensus, a deal feels as far away as ever, with members continuing to conduct an intricate game of political poker, utilising the media to further their cause. It is becoming increasingly evident that some of the more prominent OPEC members care more about holding on to market share than helping raise the price of oil. Hence despite agreeing to a production cut, we have seen the likes of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran all continue to raise production. In another signal that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is solid, sales of recreational vehicles are on track to hit their highest level in four decades. Shipments of new RVs are expected to hit 419,500 this year, industry figures say, up 12% on last year. These whopping motorhomes and trailers are, apparently, popular with Millennials who want to get into the Great Outdoors in some comfort. But....these things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come cheap. A typical RV will cost six-figures,. You could even splash out one million dollars if, say, you want large beds, flat screen TVs and space for your own sports car.... Meanwhile in Greece... Athens has received an unexpected boost ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of eurozone finance ministers (the eurogroup). Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. The Dutch finance minister and eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has not always batted for Greece but today he came out firmly in favour of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 longstanding argument that primary surplus targets set by international creditors in the years ahead are simply unachievable. Addressing the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs committee, the Dutchman suggested it would be counter-productive if Greece was given unrealistic fiscal targets once its current bailout program expires in 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be realistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that it would be a big ask if Athens was made to pull off the herculean task of achieving a 3.5% primary surplus when its fiscal adjustment program was finally completed. Djisselbloem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come in the wake of similar optimism expressed by visiting European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Conducting a two-day visit to Athens ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group, the Frenchman also voiced support for the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid to secure debt relief saying reprofiling of the unustainable load should also begin by year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. At over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn, or 180% of GDP, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden is the biggest in Europe and widely viewed as the root of its financial woes. But demands for more austerity still loom large and could threaten to overturn economic progress in the months ahead. Back in Vienna, the UAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has told energy reporters that Opec could still achieve a deal to cut output tomorrow. Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei said it was premature to assume that the cartel would fail, despite the clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran behind the scenes. Amena Bakr of Energy Intelligence has the details (again): After the excesses of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, British business has been showing its charitable side today. For the third year running, voluntary bodies have been working with companies to encourage people to give money, or time, to good causes - from cancer charities to Syrian aid. Some 1,500 UK-based businesses and charities are taking part this year, including BT - which hosted an event at its iconic Tower this morning - Royal Mail, Royal Bank of Scotland, and several retailers including Morrisons, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and the Co-op. The idea started in the 2012 in America, and last year, it raised over $45m worldwide. The Charities Aid Foundation is co-ordinating it in the UK. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve sent some details over: A choir of MPs singing Christmas carols on College Green to raise money to support the work of doctors in Aleppo, as part of the Singing for Syrians appeal. MPs taking part included Victoria Prentis, Will Quince, Robert Buckland, Andrea Jenkyns and Eilidh Whiteford. Pictures are available on request.

CAF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hannah Terrey has written about it for us here: And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new-fangled Twitter Moment too.... An Opec source has now told Reuters that Iran want Saudi Arabia to cut its output to 9.5m barrels per day, from around 10.5m today. That means Saudi would be taking the entire one million barrel per day cut which was provisionally agreed in September in Algeria. That may be unacceptable to Riyadh -- both economically and politically.... The Opec situation in a brisk nutshell: These latest comments out of Vienna show that Iraq and Iran are at odds with Saudi Arabia over the proposed Opec output cut. The hardline stance from Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zangenah shows that Tehran is not willing to curb its own output. The situation is complicated; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real agreement on how much Iran is actually pumping today! So Saudi Arabia are effectively being challenged to swallow the output cut themselves, while other cartel members would simply benefit from the resulting higher prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest dispatch from the Opec HQ: OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to bridge differences between OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s de factol eader, Saudi Arabia, and the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna, effectively signalling he was not prepared to reduce output. OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed in September to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014. OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cutsas their output has been crimped by unrest and sanctions. The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its political arch-rival SaudiArabia increased output. In recent weeks, Riyadh offered to cut its own output by 500,000 barrels per day, according to OPEC sources, and suggested Iran limit production at around 3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current output. But Tehran has sent mixed signals including that it wanted to produce 4.2 million bpd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of the scrum (or possibly rolling maul) which greeted Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, as he arrived in Vienna. Listen out for the breaking vase! There is high drama in Vienna, where Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has declared that his country will NOT cut oil production. Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told a heaving throng of oil reporters that Iran would stick to the production levels set earlier this year, and would not accept any output cuts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of finalising a deal to cut production levels at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official meeting in Vienna. And Bloomberg is now reporting that Saudi will reject a deal, unless Iran and Iraq agree to a compromise These comments have sent the Brent crude oil price plunging by over 3% to 46.51 per barrel, down over 1.5 dollars. The press scrum also sent a vase flying to the floor of Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel foyer -- the second broken vase in as many days! As we covered earlier, Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister had also told reporters that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not optimistic about a deal this week. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confident either: Reports of Russia not attending the OPEC gathering has dented hopes of a meaningful deal while concerns of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia failing to bridge their differences continues to encourage sellers to attack oil. The US Federal Reserve is now even more likely to hike interest rates next month, says Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust US GDP growth in the third quarter, driven by household demand, was a marked improvement on the first half of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This should bolster the case for a rise in US interest rates in December. We think the Fed will wait until they see the scale and timing of any Trumpflation fiscal boost, before altering their language about gradual rate hikes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are a sign that America has recovered from a slow start to 2016, says the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Samson. The data released on Tuesday confirm that the economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest rate in two years, representing a sharp pick-up from the 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent pace logged in the first and second quarters, respectively. Consumption growth, a key element of US economic output, was revised higher to a 2.8 per cent pace, from the previous reading of 2.1 per cent. FT: US GDP revision confirms strengthening recovery The Wall Street Journal is impressed by the pick-up in corporate profits: Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also showed that a key measure of U.S. corporate profits increased for the third consecutive quarter. Profits after tax, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose 3.5% from the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.694 trillion in the third quarter. Compared with a year earlier, after-tax profits rose 5.2% last quarter, the strongest annual reading since the fourth quarter of 2012. WSJ: US GDP Growth Revised Up to Strongest Expansion in Two Years Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX reckons growth will continue to accelerate in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew even faster than expected in the last three months. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.2% in the July to September quarter, up from the first estimate of 2.9%, according to new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This is the fastest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014, thanks to stronger consumer spending, exports (especially soybeans!) and federal government spending. That equates to a quarterly expansion of around 0.8% - which means America comfortably outpaced Britain, which only grew by 0.5%, and Germany and France (which both grew by a mere 0.2%). The Commerce Department says: The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment, an acceleration in exports, an upturn in federal government spending, and smaller decreases in state and local government spending and residential fixed investment, that were partly offset by a deceleration in PCE (personal consumption), an acceleration in imports, and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Italian government bonds are strengthening, on the back of that report that the ECB would step in if the public reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional changes on Sunday. The yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year debt has dropped to 1.97%, down from 2.06% earlier. That means investors see the bonds as less risky. And bank stocks are pushing higher too; up 2.4%. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, argues that Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trigger a major crisis. While there is the possibility of a slippery slope involving a snap election, a victory by the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement and then very real questions about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing membership in the Eurozone, it is more likely that an election is averted, with a good chance that Renzi will be reappointed as Prime Minister. Even in the context of an election, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear that the Five Star Movement would be able to govern by itself. In the less likely scenario that the referendum passes, this would enable the Italian government to move more briskly on many much-needed structural economic reforms. Insiders at the European Central Bank have told Reuters that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d step in and buy more Italian bonds, if Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum leads to short-term market volatility. The ECB could use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its existing quantitative easing scheme to mop up extra Italian debt and prevent prices slumping, as investors digest the result of the vote. However, if Italy requires longer-term help, it will have to seek a formal bailout. Reuters says: The ECB could use its 80-billion-euro ($84.8 billion) monthly bond-buying programme to counter any immediate, further spike in bond yields after the vote, smoothing market moves and supporting bonds, according to four euro zone central bank sources who asked not to be named. The sources added the scheme was flexible enough to allow for a temporary increase in Italian purchases and that such a move would not necessarily need to be rubber-stamped by the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council, which is due to meet on December 8 to decide on whether to keep buying bonds after March. But they stressed this would be limited to days or weeks, to counter any immediate market volatility, because the asset-purchase programme was designed to shore up inflation and economic growth in the entire euro zone and was not intended to fight crises in individual countries. Newsflash from America: Jewellery chain Tiffany &amp; Co has admitted that its flagship store in New York has suffered from being sited next to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters. Tiffany has told shareholders that it has suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some adverse effect on traffic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recent election-related activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd near its New York store. That store is on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, adjacent to Trump Tower, meaning access has been affected by the protests against the president-elect. Tiffany also warns that it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any assurance that sales won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer in the crucial Christmas period, or beyond. However, it also emphasises that the store provides less than 10% of its net sales. Tiffany describes its New York shop as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply the most famous store there is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- partly thanks to the exploits of Ms Holly Golightly. But it now finds itself right next to a massive security operation. Concrete barriers have been erected outside Trump Tower, and armed police are posted outside, at a reported cost of $1m per day. Security is likely to be extremely tight on 5th Avenue throughout Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure as president, depending how much time he spends at the Tower. His wife Melania, and son Barron, are expected to stay there until at least the end of the school year, and will require constant protection. The New York Daily News reported two weeks ago that the US secret service wants to close 5th Avenue down when the president is in situ, which would clearly be bad news for local shops. And the New York Post reports that local restaurants have suffered from falling sales. Willie Degel, founder of Uncle Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steakhouse on 56th Street and Sixth Avenue, fumed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been a complete nightmare. Pedestrian foot traffic is down tremendously. Everybody in the area is suffering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The good news for Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is that worldwide net sales increased 1% in the last three months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its third-quarter results. Austria could also contribute to eurozone worries this weekend, when voters head to the polls to choose a new president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a straight fight between far-right candidate Nobert Hofer, of the Freedom Party, and Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Greens Party. Van der Bellen is running on a pro-EU platform, saying voters have a choice between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a co-operative and an authoritarian style.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in 2016, this may be tempting fate.... This vote was originally due to take place in September, but was postposed when the glue on some postal votes failed (very 2016!). Carlo Alberto de Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says traders will be watching events closely: We are seeing a weight of pressure on the euro due to the Italian Referendum and the re-run of the Austrian presidential vote, both taking place this weekend. They could impact the euro significantly. The oil price is sliding as Opec members struggle to reach an accord before Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s make-or-break meeting. Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister has sparked the selloff, by telling reporters in Vienna that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the cartel will agree a supply cuts deal tomorrow. Brent crude is currently down almost one dollar per barrel at $47.37, a 1.8% decline. Indonesia are only a small player, but traders are clearly desperate for any smoke signals from the Opec HQ. The success, or failure, of Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting appears to depend on Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. Analysts reckon that the authorities in Tehran and Baghdad has hoped that Riyadh would swallow the proposed output cuts itself, allowing them to keep pumping. But Saudi are taking a harder line -- even though their economy is suffering badly from the low oil price. Veteran Opec analyst Yasser Elguindi of Medley Global Advisors dubs it a poker game: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stakes are extremely high, and everyone seems to be upping the ante. The thing with poker though is you can win even if you have a weak hand. But right now its hard to know who is bluffing and who is holding aces.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farming industry is facing a labour shortage as foreign fruit and veg pickers leave the UK following the EU referendum. The Financial Times reports that half the firms who supply workers to the horticulture sector couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find enough labour in the July-September quarter. And the National Farmers Union is getting worried, the FT says: In a letter to Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, dated November 10 and seen by the FT, Minette Batters, the NFU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a clear emerging labour crisis in the industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very real risk that British fruit and vegetables will be left to rot unpicked in British fields in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rural areas saw solid support for Leaving the EU in June -- but perhaps farmers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaking back control\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to mean \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-one wants to pick our carrots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Tax lawyer Jo Maugham points out that the slump in the pound means workers from the eurozone now earn almost 20% less. Anyone who likes a spot of Christmas pud faces further heartache -- the sugar, raisins and butter are now much pricier. The euro has dipped back below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.06 this morning, down 0.2%. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: The euro may have received some initial support as Fillon won France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential nomination, before coming under renewed pressure. Political risks remain a downwards pressure on the euro; attention at the moment has largely been on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum on 4 December. Boom! UK consumers are running up credit at the fastest rate in over a decade, before the credit crunch And people are taking out more mortgages too, in another signal that Brexit uncertainty isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurting consumer confidence yet. Reuters has the details: Consumer credit increased last month by \u00c2\u00a31.62bn, up from \u00c2\u00a31.48bn in September and taking the annual growth rate to 10.5%- the strongest since October 2005, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday. Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 67,518 in October from 63,594 in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 65,000 mortgage approvals were made in October. Over in France, statistics body INSEE has confirmed that the economy grew by a lacklustre 0.2% in the third quarter of 2016. That matches the provisional reading; we now also know that consumer spending was flat, investment crept up by 0.2%. Economists believe consumer spending will pick up in the run-up to Christmas -- that could be crucial, with the French presidential election due next spring. After a slow start, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking shares have now rallied by 2% today. That may mean investors are a little more hopeful that Italy can ride out this crisis. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Unicredit, says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance that the Italian referendum could trigger a Lehman Brothers-style collapse. Speaking on Bloomberg, Nielsen explains that thee Italian banks are too small, and they also have the European Central Bank waiting in the wings to help if needed. Nielsen says investors are anticipating defeat for Renzi on Sunday. Nobody really expects a yes vote, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question about how close it will be and if those opinion polls from way back are right or wrong. But whatever happens, Italy needs to tackle the under-performing loans that are clogging up its financial sector. As Nielsen puts it: The big, big question is, whichever scenario comes though, can Italy address the question of the medium-sized banks which everyone knows they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been dragging their feet on for too long. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to assume that the Italian people will reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to reform the Senate, says Deutsche Bank. They point out that many voters were undecided last week (before we entered a polling black0out period). They might yet fall behind Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive to concentrate political power in the lower house, making it easier to get legislation into law. True... but as Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chart shows, the No campaign has been widening its lead for since the summer: Now this is interesting.... Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera is reporting that Matteo Renzi is considering resigning as prime minister even if he wins on Sunday. Under this strategy, Renzi would look to be re-appointed as prime minister with a new government, and broader support in the current parliament. Then he could push through more constitutional reforms, before holding general elections in 2017 and 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Correire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Most European stock markets have fallen in early trading, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drops, as Italian referendum fears give traders an extra chill. However, the Italian FTSE MIB has actually risen a little after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% slide (it may only be a cattus mortuus bounce, as the index has lost 28% in the last year). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts nervousness until the weekend: Since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear no more about the Italian referendum until the event itself, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what is supposed to provide clear direction in Europe today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a case of angst, which probably will, at some point, turn into nervousness sufficient to take the Euro back down. Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard warns that Italy could need a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn bailout to patch up its banks. He says markets are bracing for Renzi to be defeated on Sunday, triggering months of political turmoil. Sources in Rome say the Italian government may have to turn to the European Stability Mechanism for a bank rescue, a humiliating and painful course that must be approved by the German Bundestag. It would amount to a partial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Troika\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdadministration under terms dictated by the EU. One senior Italian banker said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the banks will have to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn in fresh capital. This is going to need an ESM bail-out. The problems in the banks are becoming an excuse to put Italy under an EU programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen under Renzi because he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there any longer after a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote. What we expect is a technocrat government that pushes this through.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Global investors are becoming more concerned that the eurozone could break up, as fears over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future grow. German research form Sentix reports that almost 20% of investors expect Italy to leave the eurozone in the next 12 months - the highest level since they started polling four years ago. Investors are worried that Matteo Renzi will lose Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, and concerned about the financial health of the Italian banking sector, says Julien Muller of Sentix. Overall, the chances that a single country leaving the eurozone has risen to 24.1%, well below the peaks over 70% seen at the height of the 2012 crisis. Global stock markets could be rocked next week if the Italian people reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform plan, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She says: A no vote on Sunday is a major event risk for the European financial sector. Up to 8 Italian banks could fail, as Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank bailout programme is likely to be scrapped if he resigns. It is not known what would replace it, or if the European authorities would step in to save the Italian financial system. If not, then the creditworthiness of some of the larger more systemic banks, such as Deutsche Bank, could be at risk. DB has plenty of risks of its own, if the European authorities don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t save Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector, then how could it justify saving Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank? Thus, we could see further declines in DB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price before the week is out. Brooks also points out that referendum opinion polling has been suspended since November 18, creating extra uncertainty: This is likely to increase the tension and nervousness around this referendum, and could keep market volatility high for the rest of this week. The Vix, Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear gauge, started to rise on Monday, and we could see further advances in volatility in the coming days, putting pressure on stocks and causing safe havens like the yen and US Treasuries to rally. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Eurozone crisis jitters are returning to the City this morning, as investors worry that the smouldering problems in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are about to burst into life. On Sunday, Italian votes head to the polls to vote on constitutional reforms - and many observers believe they will slap down prime minister Mattio Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to curb the power of the Senate. That could trigger Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, and potentially pave the way for radical, anti-Euro Five Star Movement to take power. That could scupper efforts to recapitalise Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which are weighed down by bad loans, and possibly require a full-blown bailout from the European Central Bank. As Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are at a critical stage in trying to rebuild their finances and, if Renzi loses the referendum and quits, then those efforts are going to be in deep trouble.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guaranteed, even if he loses his referendum. He could potentially stay on as caretaker PM, but even this would leave Italy looking less stable. Renzi has insisted that political power needs to be more concentrated in the lower house of parliament, and the government, transforming the Senate from a directly elected upper house into a more consultative body representing Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cities and regions. Italian bank shares slid by almost 4% on Monday, dragged down by referendum worries and fears that financial firm Monti Dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue plan might falter. Also coming up today... Things are getting frostier, literally and metaphorically, in Vienna ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the Opec oil cartel. Yesterday, technical talks between Opec members failed to reach a deal on how to cut production. (non-Opec member) Russia has helpfully weighed in, with Vladimir Putin saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that Opec stabilises the market. In the UK, prime minister Theresa May will announce a crackdown on excessive pay at privately owned companies, to bring them into line with firms floated on the stock market. The announcement is due around lunchtime. Our City editor Jill Treanor has the story: Theresa May is to promise a crackdown on boardroom excess at large privately owned businesses as she unveils proposals intended to hold corporate Britain to account. The prime minister said the government would look at ways to bring privately owned companies under a regime that could mimic the one imposed on major stock market companies. While many private companies were performing well, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have, however, seen an irresponsible minority of privately held companies acting carelessly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving employees, customers and pension fund beneficiaries to suffer when things go wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we will explore ways to improve and extend good governance across big business so that everybody plays by the same rules and we create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We get a new healthcheck on the French and American economies today. 7.45am GMT: Second estimate of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP for the third quarter of 2016 (first estimate was 0.2% growth) 1.36pm GMT: Second estimate of US economic growth in Q3 (first estimate was 3.0% annualised growth) Plus, entertainment group Merlin and sausage maker Cranswick are reporting results. And telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proceeding with a formal notification\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to force BT to legally separate its Openreach arm, having been disappointed with progress to date.

Last month, Uber, a taxi app relying on 40,000 self-employed drivers, lost an employment tribunal case when judges asserted that drivers should be classed as workers. That could mean Uber must pay national insurance contributions, as well as sick pay and paid holiday. Uber is appealing against the ruling. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, also warned last week of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153structural effect of rapidly rising incorporation and self-employment, which further erodes revenues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Writing in the Guardian, Taylor says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment system \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has weaknesses and is not future-proof\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and adds that the gig economy is only set to grow. He says some retailers are considering adopting Uber-style self-employment models, and are asking whether \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they need people employed to work a full shift in our shop and can instead have people on call who come in for an hour or two during busy periods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Taylor will report back to Theresa May next year on modern employment practices and says he is concerned about businesses which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impose the expectations and obligations of employees but, by defining workers as self-employed, deny them their due rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hermes, the parcel delivery giant which uses 10,500 self-employed couriers, is currently facing an HM Revenue and Customs investigation following multiple allegations from couriers that they should be classed as workers or employees rather than contractors. Several have said they are paid less than the national minimum wage. The government has also announced the first official study of its kind into the scale of the gig economy and the reasons people join it, and appointed three experts to Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s panel. They are Paul Broadbent the chief executive of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, Greg Marsh, the founder of the web-based homes rental site Onefinestay, and leading employment lawyer Diane Nichol. From January to March the review will take evidence in public hearings across the UK in a tour planned to take in towns and cities including Glasgow, Coventry and Maidstone. The business minister Margot James said the government recognised the need to be open to innovative working, but said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is crucial that workers receive a decent wage and that people working in all sorts of jobs are able to benefit from the right balance of flexibility, rights and protections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Taylor also suggested that companies which lost employment tribunals should face automatic investigations to check whether illegal behaviour such as underpayment of the minimum wage or false self-employment were endemic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If an employer is found to be paying under the minimum wage on one or more cases, it should be more automatic that we go in and find out if those behaviours are rife in that organisation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.",
