Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. </p> <p>No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.</p> <p>At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged.

Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified.<br></li> <li><strong>The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory.</strong> There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward.<br></li> <li><strong>Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power</strong>, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions.<br></li> <li><strong>For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits,</strong> irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward.<br></li> </ol> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T15:00:47.577Z\">at 3.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582489f6e4b051849de87cc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T14:57:56.763Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%.<br></strong></p> <p>They\u2019re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with <strong>Pfizer</strong> gaining 3.6%.

Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure.</p> <p>To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d.</p> <p>Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks use<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/laffer-curve-napkin-doodle-launched-supply-side-economics\">back of the napkin logic</a> to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t).</p> </blockquote> <p>But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots more here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/796698770138419201\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Political Economy &amp;

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points. It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from infrastructure sending). But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or protectionist trade police would hurt them. Bloomberg has a neat summary: Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.\u2019s 4.3 percent rally. Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent. Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of higher inflation and extra US government borrowing. The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump and Barack Obama have their first meeting since the election. It\u2019s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious. Our US politics liveblog has full details. Here\u2019s a flavour: Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u201cIf he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u201d Obama said. Trump said he had \u201crespect for the president\u201d and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u201cvery fine man.\u201d And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close. I\u2019m taking a break now, but we\u2019ll be back with the Wall Street close... Capital Economics says investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump\u2019s plans: There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic policies of the incoming Republican administration. However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on track to hit a record close. Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the rally, on predictions that they\u2019ll benefit from Trumponomics. But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they\u2019ll suffer under the next presidency. Here\u2019s the story of how the Dow defied forecasts and spiked after Trump\u2019s victory: A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, triggering a late selloff in London. Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as investors come to terms with Trump\u2019s success. A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the value of international companies who earn money abroad. So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, finished 0.4% higher though. It\u2019s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates) Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America will need a lot more metal to implement Trump\u2019s new infrastructure plan. But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, some by over 5%. The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with Donald Trump, and isn\u2019t prejudging him. Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to speculate\u201d about whether Trump would hurt the global economy. Rice added: \u201cWe need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we\u2019ll be making an assessment at that time.\u201d European stock markets are heading lower in late trading, as Trump-inspired volatility grips the City again. The S&amp;P tech stock index has shed 3%, and is on track for its worst day since the Brexit vote (via Reuters). Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president. Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too. Trump\u2019s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news for the tech sector. He\u2019s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign. Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn\u2019t crashed since Donald Trump pulled off one of the most surprising election results of the age. But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider consequences of America\u2019s choice -- as the protests in New York, Chicago, Boston etc overnight show. Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the world watches him closely. The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve. Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy: The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates. And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says: This is about the kind of country that America wants to be. At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election. And most analysts were wrong. There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied since Trump won the presidential race, says Jim Cielinski of Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Trump \u201cthe President\u201d will not be the same thing as Trump \u201cthe candidate\u201d. Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified. The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward. Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions. For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward. Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%. They\u2019re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are boosted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, as she\u2019d promised to end price-gouging. And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild American infrastructure. Caterpillar is up 2%. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as the Trump bump reached New York. Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to yesterday\u2019s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if Republicans won the race for the White House. The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709. And the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too: Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog. Indeed, there\u2019s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be: Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen\u2019s position at the Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months. Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation! The Financial Times has coined this term, to explain the big selloff in bond prices today. The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new president drives up economic growth, inflation, and inflation expectations, with a debt-financed stimulus programme. Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says: \u201cUnder a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that drives growth and markets are reflecting that. \u201cThere was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr Trump\u2019s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is steepening.\u201d And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause a bond crash. Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth. He\u2019s been speaking on CNBC: Greenspan also backed Donald Trump over one issue - the regulation of America\u2019s banking sector - saying: \u201cI\u2019d love to see Dodd-Frank disappear. Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now. The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies will drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster profit growth consequently boosting inflation. So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation. Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their national debts. The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night. The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06% The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17% Longer-dated debt is also weakening: We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their quantitative easing schemes. So a return to normal levels wouldn\u2019t be a disaster. Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently. And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European markets are lower as this morning\u2019s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out. Investors may be taking a big risk by deciding that Donald Trump will become a new man once he crosses the seal in the Oval Office carpet. The \u2018Trump bump\u2019 has been based on a somewhat breezy assumption that the new president will successfully implement the debt-fuelled infrastructure programme that many experts support, while ignoring the chance that we actually enter an era of painful protectionism and trade wars. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group in London, has just published a \u2018must-read\u2019 blog piece, analysing the impact of Trump. Here\u2019s a flavour: The markets seem to have decided that [aggressive deficit-financed state spending] will indeed now happen \u2014 stocks up, commodities up, bonds down. Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure. To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d. Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks useback of the napkin logic to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t). But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says: Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness. And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve. There\u2019s lots more here: Hello.... the rally in European stocks is petering out. The FTSE 100 has now shed its early gains and is now down 6 points, having been up 50 points at the start. Not clear what\u2019s prompted this... Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, is cautiously hopeful that the infrastructure plan proposed by Donald Trump could help the US economy. He just told Bloomberg TV that he \u201cwelcomes and applauds\u201d Trump\u2019s pledge to renew America\u2019s highways, bridges, airports schools and hospitals. It could boost job creation in the short tun, and expand the US economy\u2019s capacity for growth in the medium term, believes Summers - who has often called for more fiscal spending to fight \u2018secular stagnation\u2019. But Summers also sounds deeply concerned, saying Trump needs to propose \u201cserious and concrete plans\u201d to address America\u2019s economic concerns, and surround himself with responsible people with \u201cconsiderable experience\u201d. He says calling China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d is unwise, while repealing the NAFTA trade deal would do enormous economic damage. And Summers, who served under Bill Clinton, suggets Trump cannot be as divisive in government as he was in the campaign. Unless there is a clear sense that all Americans are welcomed and part of his vision of a prosperous America, and all nations are part of his vision o f a prosperous world, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be successful in creating the world we all want to see, Summers concludes. Demand for gold hit a record high yesterday, which tells you a couple of things. 1) There was a massive flight to safe-haven assets as the shock election result rocked Asian and European markets. 2) People are buying gold as a hedge against inflation (the price has risen by 0.3% today). Over in America, Donald Trump is preparing to visit the White House to meet president Obama, following a night of protests against his election victory. Our main liveblog is covering all the details: Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says Donald Trump needs to flesh out his economics plans, fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mann says Trump needs to set out policies to identify sources of growth in the US economy, and make sure the benefits are shared fairly between the American people. That\u2019s what got him to the White House , the fact that the gains aren\u2019t widely shared. The deputy leader of Germany\u2019s governing CDU party, Michael Fuchs, hopes that president Trump will be more responsible than nominee Trump: The copper prices has hit its highest level since July 2015, up 5% today, thanks to Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure. And shares in two mining companies, Antofagasta and Vedanta, have both soared by 14% as investors anticipate a new fiscal boost next year. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says copper is the \u2018big winner\u2019 from Trump\u2019s victory (which won\u2019t be much comfort to those on the losing side). He adds: President elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to spend more than $500 billion on rebuilding America\u2019sroads, bridges and airports helped send construction and steel stocks sharply higher following his surprise election win. Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta Resources, also anticipates a boost. He says (via Blooomberg): All that we see for President-elect Trump is that he will focus on building, he will focus on the infrastructure. \u201cThat is what the market is reacting to.\u201d Trump\u2019s victory is also driving up the shares of military and defence companies. BAE Systems have jumped by 6% this morning, adding to yesterday\u2019s spike following the election result. It\u2019s a sign that the City expect Trump to deliver on his promise to boost spending on the US military (which he claimed had become depleted on president Obama\u2019s watch). BAE is one of the biggest suppliers to the US department of defence, and makes armoured vehicles, ships, fighter jets and missiles. And if Trump weakens the ties between Nato members, then European countries may feel compelled to boost their own armies. Here\u2019s confirmation that inflation expectations are rising, via analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group: Predictions that Donald Trump\u2019s policies will drive US inflation higher are causing some dramatic moves in the financial markets today. The interest rate, or yield, on Britain\u2019s 10-year government bonds just jumped over 1.31%, up from 1.23% on Wednesday night. That\u2019s the highest level since 24th June, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. Other European government bond yields are also rising. Investors are betting that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and debt-fuelled spending plans, if enacted, would be inflationary. So they\u2019re seeking a higher rate of return for holding government debt. The news overnight that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to force Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to resign has also cheered the markets. Yellen\u2019s first term expires in 2018, but there has been speculation that she might feel pressure to step down, given the attacks from Trump during the campaign. Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, has told Bloomberg TV that market confidence will improve if Yellen stays, adding: If she goes, who knows, because that depends on who comes in next. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson has been giving some more reaction to Trump\u2019s victory at a press conference in Beijing. Asked about Trump\u2019s vows to introduce a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, spokesperson Lu Kang noted that economic ties were blossoming with trade increasing from $2.5bn in 1970 to $560bn last year. \u201cEconomic cooperation between China and the US is what has made our bilateral relations stable and has propelled our bilateral relation forward,\u201d Lu said. \u201cI hope US is able to view our economic trade relationship in an objective and unbiased manner and work with us so that we can move forward. I believe that if the US keeps the country\u2019s interest and its people\u2019s interests in mind, they will make the right decision\u201d. Asked whether such protectionist measures would harm the US-China relationship the spokesperson said: \u201cI will not comment on speculation. As I said I believe that the US\u2019s leaders will make their decision based on the fundamental interests of their people. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to hit a new record high, when the US stock market opens in five hours. Last night, the Dow closed near to its highest levels, and the future market is predicting a fresh spike today. The prospect of tax reforms and a government spending boost are pushing shares up, says Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First. He says the intial Trump slump has swiftly transformed into the Trump jump: The shortening of the timeframe between decline and rebound could be down to many things but issues around full Republican control of the Presidency and the possibility that changes in tax reform, investment and regulation will come through quicker may help. Trump has also been called \u2018an inflation time-bomb\u2019 given his pledges to increase spending so we must now look at Fed policy through a new lens. Similarly, although he was elected yesterday he does not take the reins until January 20th. Well quite: Investors are hoping that taking on the presidency might provoke a change in Donald Trump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the market rally is based on: ...an reassessment of views about Trump and belief that a more Presidential individual is already replacing the highly divisive candidate character he merely portrayed in order to appeal to American frustration and win the populist vote. Markets are demonstrating an impressive ability to digest significant political change and move on, even quicker than we saw in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Given some of Trump\u2019s conduct during the election campaign (divisive comments about Muslims, Mexicans, those awful tape-recordings about women...), a transformation by Inauguration Day would be welcome. But is it realistic? Anyone who bought European shares during Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech yesterday morning has made a decent profit. The markets have now gained 4.6% since Wednesday\u2019s opening tumble: European banks are also rallying, on speculation that the next president might unravel some of the regulations brought in since the 2008 crisis. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to tear up Dodd-Frank -- the legislation brought in to protect consumers and prevent banks becoming too big to fail. Trump believes it is holding back the economy, and once told Fox News that: \u201cWe have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren\u2019t loaning to people that need it. The regulators are running the banks.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear what Trump would replace Dodd-Frank with; simply ditching the law could create the conditions that caused the credit crisis in the first place. Coper-producer Antofagasta is the top riser in London, with fellow miners Glencore and Anglo American close behind. Traders are betting that Trump\u2019s programme of cutting taxes, a new debt-funded infrastructure programme, would push up inflation and raise demand for commodities. European markets are open, and shares are rising, as predictions of a Trump slump are trampled in an early wave of buying. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 49 points, or 0.7%, to 6960 in early trading. Mining stocks and financial companies are leading the way. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB have also gained around 0.7% to 0.9%. The City analysts who predicted markets would slump if Trump pulled off a shock win have some explaining to do today. The consensus view was that Trump\u2019s sheer unpredictability, opposition to free trade, bombastic and often-shocking comments - plus the vague and uncosted nature of his proposals - would scare investors out of town. But instead, we got a knee-jerk selloff yesterday, followed very swiftly by a bounceback (which Asia just caught up with.) It\u2019s a lesson to all of us about how markets react, as Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Buy the rumour, sell the news or in this case, sell the rumour and buy the news. We were all told this when we first arrived in dealing rooms and it is used to explain why academics and non-market participants are so often confused by the reaction of markets to events. I\u2019m not sure I can remember a better example of this maxim than the last week\u2019s market reaction to changing speculation about the outcome of the US Presidential election, and then to what happened. The result is plenty of egg on the face of all sorts of people. Mine included. So instead, investors quickly began reassessing the implications of a Trump presidency, and a Republican-controlled Congress. Kit says: It is widely expected that President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts, particularly for corporations, that will be positive for growth and will boost inflation. It may not be that simple for Trump to get things done -- the Tea Party wing won\u2019t like the thought of a debt-fuelled stimulus plan, for starters. Good morning from London, where bleary-eyed traders have returned to their desks. We\u2019re not expecting a repeat of the huge rally seen in Asia overnight - London had its Trump rally yesterday afternoon. But the markets are still expected to rise, as the City continues to defy expectations and take yesterday\u2019s shock election result in its stride. You might have thought that the sight of anti-Trump demonstrations at several major US cities overnight would alarm the markets. But right now, they\u2019re more interested in the next president\u2019s promise of a fiscal stimulus. Also, the graceful and mature way that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama reacted to Trump\u2019s win has also calmed nerves -- investors like a peaceful transfer of power. A huge recovery on Asia Pacific\u2019s stock markets as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. Plenty of commentators have doubts about whether the upbeat impact of Trump\u2019s victory can be sustained across the region but the impact is overwhelmingly positive for now. Here are the main points of the day so far: Share markets had one of their best days for years. The Nikkei rose 6.72% thanks to a weaker yen while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 3.34%. South Korea, Hong Kong and China all up too Europe and the US due to open up The US dollar dipped slightly from Wednesday\u2019s highs to 105.2740 Japanese yen while US bond yields spiked amid expectation of Fed rate hike in December Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to quit, the WSJ reports China fixes the yuan at its lowest for six years while JP Morgan warns of possible trade shock S&amp;P affirms US AA+/A-1+ rating amid concern about Trump\u2019s \u2018inexperience\u2019 Construction commodities surge with iron ore at 30-month high and copper at 16-month high Thanks for reading \u2013 the indefatigable Graeme Wearden will take the reins from London in a moment. Oliver Holmes, our south-east Asia correspondent, has been looking at the impact of Trump\u2019s win on his business interests in the region. Oliver writes: Despite the global downturn, two companies in the Philippines and Indonesia that are linked to Trump saw their shares soar on news that he had been elected president. Shares in a Philippine firm building a 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila jumped by a massive 20%, from 1.22 to 1.47 US cents on the local stock market. The main index on the Philippine Stock Exchange fell, however, by 2.5%. In Indonesia, shares in a company controlled by Trump\u2019s local business partner, tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, also surged by 23%. The Jakarta stock exchange dropped by 1.4% on Wednesday. Trump and Tanoesoedibjo plan to build a resort and a golf course in west Java, projects that many in Indonesia \u2014 the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation \u2014 condemned last year when Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A huge day for the Japanese stock market which soared 1,092.88 points to 17,344.42, a rise of 6.72%. There have been big moves in the bond markets in the past 24 hours as investors have dumped the safety of government paper in favour of equities and the dollar. Yields on US Treasury 10-year notes reversed an initial plunge to 1.716% and bolted to 2.09% overnight as the price of bonds dropped. The net rise of 21 basis points was the largest daily increase since July 2013, Reuters said. There\u2019s also an expectation that the Fed will raise rates in December, with a possible US fiscal stimulus seeing the return of inflation and more rate rises. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. Futures trading suggests Europe and the US will rejoin the party when the markets open later today. Spread better IG sees the FTSE100 up 0.5% at 6940 points, while the Dax in Germany will be up 0.68% at 10,715 points. The Dow Jones on Wall Street is set to open up around 60 points. The Nikkei has gone even better than the ASX today with a rise nearly 7%, helped by a drop in the yen as the US dollar received a Trump bump as we might now have to call it. But the authorities are still worried that they might have to act to keep the yen down in future. Hiroshi Watanabe, former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters that \u201cif the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene\u201d, regardless of US concerns about such action. If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. It\u2019s been a good day for investors down under \u2013 the best in fact since 2011, AAP reports. The ASX/S&amp;P200 has closed up 172.2 points, or 3.34%, at 5,328.8 points, adding $50bn to the market\u2019s value, more than making up for yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining and construction stocks led the way on hopes of a boom in the US. Surging iron ore prices also helped, soaring past the 2016 peak to $71 a tonne. Copper \u2013 a key construction material \u2013 also jumped 4% to a 16-month high, Reuters reported. There\u2019s a lot of commentary around today about Trump\u2019s trade policies and what they will mean for the global economy. We\u2019ve already heard from JP Morgan and Saul Eslake. And here\u2019s Paul Bloxham from HSBC in Australia, speaking to Australian Associated Press. For Australia, the main negative impact seems likely to be the effect that reduced global trade could have on Asian growth, given Asia\u2019s high trade reliance. Continued strengthening of Australia\u2019s economic ties to China should be a priority as it would help support local growth even in the face of rising global trade protectionism. But Standard Life, in a research note quoted by AAP, saw the possibility that Trump could moderate his campaign promises, which included putting tariffs of 45% on Chinese goods and 35% on Mexican goods, in order to avoid disruption. It is plausible that the new administration will not ramp up tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, content instead to bury the prospect of new trade agreements and make more use of enforcement clauses in existing agreements. Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to an adviser, despite speculation that he might try to end her term prematurely. Judy Shelton, an economist and senior fellow at the Atlas Network and adviser to Trump on monetary policy, told the Wall Street Journal that \u201che\u2019s not urging her to resign at all\u201d. However, the Journal reports that Shelton did concede that Trump was minded to replace Yellen when she completes her first term in 2018. He\u2019s saying he\u2019d want someone whose thinking is more in keeping with his own. Trump was openly critical of Yellen in one of the presidential debates in September, saying that interest rates had been kept too low and that asset bubbles created by loose monetary settings would eventually burst. JP Morgan\u2019s team in Australia have been looking at what Trump\u2019s win could mean for the global economy \u2013 and Australia\u2019s. They say that a US fiscal stimulus would have limited benefits for the rest of the world while trade barriers could mean trouble for trading partners. A US policy-induced trade shock will be negative for global growth. This leaves risks to global growth more asymmetric than was previously the case. Second, the distribution of risks to Chinese growth have shifted to the downside, given the increased probability of rising tensions in US-China trade relations and weaker Chinese export growth. A trade shock could in turn damage the US. A marked slowing in US growth might not be an issue, except that growth in the rest of the global economy doesn\u2019t look robust enough \u2013 particularly given limited scope for additional policy support \u2013 to provide much of a buffer. And even in the event that US growth slows on a trade shock, this will likely be more inflationary (via higher import prices) than would have otherwise been the case, meaning that the growth and inflation trade-off in the US becomes less favourable. And that means that interest rate cuts are back on the horizon in Australia. For the RBA, we think this underscores the risk that rates are likely to go lower in Australia. All else equal, domestic growth needs to be stronger to provide an offset to external shocks, should they occur. US billionaire Carl Icahn apparently cashed in on the stock market panic over Trump\u2019s election victory. The longtime Trump supporter told CNN Money that he left the Republican\u2019s victory party in Manhattan in the early hours of Wednesday to go home and buy \u201ca lot of stock\u201d in the plunging overnight market. I\u2019m glad I did that. I guess that\u2019s what makes me happy today too ... I personally don\u2019t believe that Trump is bad for the market necessarily. OK, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacfic shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u2019s losses. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87 ASX/S&amp;P200 up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u2019s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010 Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade More on the implications for Asia\u2019s big emerging economies \u2013 and Australia. Saul Eslake, the independent economist, has warned about the implications for Asutralia if Trump were to start a trade war with China and undermine the Fed, pushing the US dollar down. [This would create] a great deal of uncertainty in our part of the world, about the geopolitical environment by making a less wholesome commitment to longstanding US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan ... Those things, particulary a trade war with China, would be highly negative for Australia. Like every measure in the last 24 hours, the US dollar has been topsy-turvy. The chance of a Fed rate cut dropped to 30% on Wednesday but is now more than 80%, according to IG. The dollar index against major currencies recovered from 95.885 on Wednesday to around 98.448 on Thursday. But the longer-term outlook is uncertain as Trump pushes his protectionist agenda (see below). Tim Condon, an Singapore-based economist at ING, told Reuters: We expect a Trump Treasury to elevate the importance of the bilateral trade surplus with the US in identifying currency manipulators and intensify pressure on trade partners to allow currencies to appreciate. The yuan has been fixed today at 6.7885 \u2013 its lowest point since September 2010. Bearing in mind that Trump labelled China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his way to winning the presidency, the issue could prove to be a flashpoint between the two countries. China has pushed the value of its currency steadily downwards in the past year \u2013 very clumsily to begin with, sparking last year\u2019s mini-stock market crash \u2013 as it tries to export its way out of slowing economic growth. But everyone else has got the same idea (including Abe of course). The US dollar is holding its gains on Thursday and was sitting at 105.32 yen, up from below 102 on Wednesday. But for Trump\u2019s manufacturing recovery to work you expect that he will want it come down. The Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is planning to meet the US president-elect in New York on 17 November, a Japanese government official has said. Reuters reports that the pair had \u201ctalked by telephone and confirmed close cooperation between their two nations\u201d. It might be interesting to hear what they have to say to each other about trade and the economy. Like China, Japan has a lot to be worried about. Trump is an avowed opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal which would be a huge blow for Abe\u2019s plans to boost his country\u2019s huge manufacturing sector. The commodities market is looking slightly different to stocks today. While equities are surging ahead, the price of oil has dropped amid concerns about the impact of Trump on global trade. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 20c at $45.07 a barrel at 0131 GMT on Thursday. The more widely traded Brent was at $46.29 per barrel, down 7% from the last close. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters: The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand. Gold meanwhile dipped overnight $1,278.25 an ounce as risk receded in the markets. It rose nearly 5% to $1,337.40 on Wednesday before tumbling back down as US markets reacted positively to the Trump win. Reuters reports that S&amp;P, the ratings agency, has affirmed the country\u2019s investment-grade AA+/A-1+ sovereign rating on Wednesday while maintaining its stable outlook. It welcomed calls for unity from all sides of US politics in the wake of Trump\u2019s win but \u201chigh general government debt and increased uncertainty\u201d meant there it could not restore the coveted AAA rating it removed in 2011. Its analysis feels like a good summary of market sentiment: Given Mr Trump\u2019s lack of experience in public office, and his win as a political outsider without an established policy track record, there is a degree of uncertainty over policy formulation and execution. However, there is a difference between campaign rhetoric and concrete policy proposals and execution once in office. We await further information on the formation of a cabinet and policy proposals, particularly once the president-elect assumes office. Alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House of Representatives. Hence, the president-elect and the Republicans have a mandate for and ability to effect policy change more easily than with a more divided government in recent years. Trading has been underway for an hour now in Japan and Korea. Here\u2019s where the main indexes stand: Nikkei up 5.7% to 17,180 points Kospi in South Korea up 1.7% to 1,991 ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia up 2.88% to 5,305 points The yen, which gained so much during yesterday\u2019s turmoil, fell sharply overnight as the US dollar recovered. It\u2019s now at 105.6740, close to a four-month high. The pound and the euro are both down slightly against the greenback however, as the pattern from yesterday is reversed. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac in Australia, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hasn\u2019t waited around to see what a Trump presidency might mean for US monetary policy \u2013 it cut its base rate 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75% this morning. The move was expected and is the third cut this year. It\u2019s driven partly by a need to get the NZ dollar down to help the country\u2019s huge dairy industry. Governor Graeme Wheeler said the rate-setters had met on Thursday to discuss whether the cut was still needed in the wake of Trump\u2019s win. They decided it was but pushed back on expectations of yet another reduction soon. He said: We think at this stage that we won\u2019t need another cut. The economy is doing well and you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to create excessive volatility in respect of interest rates and output in the exchange rate by surprising the market with interest rate adjustments. This is an interesting chart. Wednesday saw one of the biggest drops in volatility ever recorded as the markets quickly put their concerns behind them and went into risk-on mode. But as with Australia, it\u2019s not clear where this is going. A Trump presidency promises a more aggressive US trading position which the markets have implicitly welcomed. But not everyone can be winners here, can they? China is the obvious loser in Asia if, let\u2019s say, Trump tries to force Apple to make its iPhones in the US instead of Shenzhen and Shangahi. Here\u2019s a snippet from Larry Elliott\u2019s piece: Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside: Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u2019s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems. The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the Nikkei rising more than 6%, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. The Kospi in Seoul is also up. The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. But experts say it\u2019s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win. Here\u2019s Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com: I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics, but could suffer from the rise in US bonds, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u2019t go with those moves higher. Huge lead from Australia this morning. The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up nearly 3% and resource and financial stocks have led the way. The iron ore producer Fortescue is the top riser at well over 10.6% but Macquarie and BHP have also shown big gains. My colleague Melissa Davey has just filed this report on the morning\u2019s surge. Meanwhile, Chris Weston at IG in Melbourne has this: The combination of huge gains in materials, fiscals and energy should push the ASX 200 3.4%, which if it closes at that level would be the strongest gain since 6 October 2011 Hello and welcome to the markets live blog from Sydney. Well, that didn\u2019t turn out quite how it was expected to \u2013 on a number of levels. The surprise of Trump\u2019s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u2019t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u2019s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Here\u2019s how they finished in the US and Europe The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. FTSE100 up 1% to 6,911.84 Dax up 1.56% to 10,646 In Australia the market has already taken that lead and opened up by nearly 3%. Can it be sustained? Here\u2019s one informed verdict. Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney, said: The stunning turn in sentiment suggests there is now a consensus building that much of the policy announced during the campaign was a sales pitch rather than a commitment to act. Investors ignored the potential for damage to international trade and growth prospects and focussed on Republican control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. This offers the prospect of reform that could stimulate the US economy. However, last night\u2019s action may be as good as it gets for markets for some time. Policy uncertainty and populist agendas rarely lead to sustainable economic growth. There\u2019s much to look at and talk about. But in the meantime start with our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s examination of what a Trump win might mean for the global economy.",

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/showArticlePage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;object_id=9865022&amp;rev_id=1&amp;elqTrackId=73388d9285554dad95048fb0523f625b&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy</a>\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. <a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;entityId=107135&amp;elqTrackId=cd1e11bd9f4640f3ab243fd182183f9c&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Italy</a> is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u201d said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p> <p>Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u2019s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. </p> <p>The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u2019s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth.</p> <p>\u201cIn the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u201cLooking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582c7bc7e4b090fc812818b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:48:14.506Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil volatile after stocks reports and Russian comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after </strong><strong>more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering.</strong></p> <p>After the American Petroleum Institute reported <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf#block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf\">a higher than expected stock build </a></strong>last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase.</p> <p>Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose.</p> <p>But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u2019s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month.</p> <p>So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:48:41.716Z\">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582c75d1e4b06ac41294e374\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:12:39.054Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany's Sch\u00e4uble dismisses Greek debt relief talk</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US president Barack Obama might be pushing for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b#block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b\">debt relief for Greece</a></strong>, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u2019s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting).

Overall, prospects of the labour market taking a turn for the worse in the not-too distant future are looking more likely.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>TUC</strong> General Secretary <strong>Frances O\u2019Grady</strong> is also worried that real pay growth is stalling, as inflation picks up</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cReal pay growth is the slowest it\u2019s been since early 2015.

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street falling back after several days of rises, investors were pausing for breath a week after Donald Trump\u2019s shock victory in the US election. The mixed picture from the UK employment data - jobless rate down, claimant count up - added to the uncertainty. But the pound held firm against the euro although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar. The US currency was boosted by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise interest rates next month, as well as the continuing expectation of a Trump spending boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The mood across most equity markets remains subdued, with modest losses being posted. Investors are evidently still cautious about the new [American] administration, with the steady drip of news relating to appointments and the like keeping the market in check. About the only thing still surging is the US dollar. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 43.02 points or 0.63% at 6749.72 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.66% to 10,663.87 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.78% at 4501.14 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 16,559.84 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.56% lower at 8638.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.44% to 592.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 73 points or 0.39%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of Italy\u2019s referendum next month, there is some unwelcome analysis from S&amp;P, which paints a fairly uninspiring picture of the prospects for the country\u2019s economy. It said: The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u201cOnly A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy\u201d). \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. Italy is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u201d said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u2019s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u2019s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth. \u201cIn the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u201cLooking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u201d Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering. After the American Petroleum Institute reported a higher than expected stock build last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration. The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase. Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose. But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u2019s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month. So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17. US president Barack Obama might be pushing for debt relief for Greece, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u2019s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting). Reuters reports: Germany on Wednesday opposed calls for debt relief for Greece after U.S. President Barack Obama offered support for such a mechanism for the recession-hit euro zone state during a trip to Athens. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said late on Tuesday granting Greece debt relief would do it a disservice. \u201cWhoever says \u2018we will relieve your debts\u2019 is doing Greece a disservice,\u201d the finance ministry confirmed Sch\u00e4uble as saying after the Passauer Neue Presse daily reported it. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s comments were not made directly in response to Obama, a finance ministry spokesman added. Athens signed up to a third economic bailout package of up to 86 billion euros last year but wants long-term debt restructuring to exit its crisis. Germany, which has long said there is no immediate need for debt relief for Greece as it would discourage much-needed structural reforms, said it noted the comments from Obama, who flies to Berlin later on Wednesday. \u201cWe have noted that President Obama has pointed to the importance of debt relief. The euro group agreed in May on a timetable on exactly that subject .. regarding measures for the short term, and later in 2018 for mid-term measures,\u201d said government spokesman Steffen Seibert at a news conference. In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018 but left key details to be decided later in a compromise between Germany\u2019s tough stance and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s call for decisions immediately. A finance ministry spokesman said there was nothing new to say. \u201cOur position is unchanged. Obama\u2019s visit has not changed anything,\u201d he said at the government news conference. The prospect of higher US interest rates has brought an end to the rally which has seen leading US shares hit new heights. After rising for seven straight trading sessions in the run up and aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s shock US presidential election victory, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.25% while Nasdaq was 0.4% lower. Back with the UK, and the Bank of England\u2019s Jon Cunliffe has said recent currency movements had made setting interest rates move difficult. Reuters reports: Sterling\u2019s sharp fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union has made it harder to set monetary policy, BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Wednesday. Cunliffe said he fully backed the central bank\u2019s neutral stance regarding its next move in interest rates, as announced earlier this month, and its latest quarterly set of forecasts which see a modest slowdown next year. The British economy probably still needed interest rates to be negative in \u2018real\u2019 or inflation-adjusted terms, but the fall in sterling meant the BoE would not necessarily be able to stick to this, Cunliffe said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the University of Manchester. US industrial production figures have come in slightly worse than expected. It was unchanged in October compared to forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The September figure was revised down from a 0.1% rise to a 0.2% fall. On his final day in Greece, US president Barack Obama repeated his belief that debt relief was vital for the country. The Athens News Agency - Macedonian Press Agency reports: Speaking at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation on Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama once again highlighted the need for Greece\u2019s creditors to agree to debt relief, in accordance with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noting that the country, and especially its young people, needed to see hope and a future. \u201cThe IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are to be sustained, people here need to see hope and they need to see progress.\u201d Young people, in particular, needed to know there is a future, there is an education, and jobs that were worthy of their potential, he added. Obama also had time for a tour of the Acropolis: And then it was off. Next stop: Berlin. Here\u2019s IHS Markit on the UK employment data: Over in Europe, and the latest on the draft budgets put forward by member states. Reuters reports: Italy and five other countries are at risk of breaking European Union budget discipline rules with their 2017 draft budgets, the European Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. The five other countries are Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia and Finland. \u201cThe Draft Budgetary Plans of these Member States might result in a significant deviation from the adjustment paths toward the respective medium-term objective,\u201d the Commission said. The medium-term objective is a budget balanced in structural terms, which means excluding one-off spending and revenue and the effects of the business cycle. Italy\u2019s structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and economic cycle swings in income and spending, has been rising every year since 2014 and is to jump to 2.2 percent in 2017 from 1.6 percent in 2016 and then further to 2.4 percent in 2018, according to Commission forecasts last week. This goes clearly against EU rules which say that countries have to cut their structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until they reach balance or surplus. Italy says the higher structural deficit is due to extraordinary spending on migration and post-earthquake reconstruction. But the structural deficit indicator does not take into account such one-off items and the Commission called the explanation \u201cnot constructive\u201d. On Wednesday, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici sounded more accommodating. \u201cThe significant part of the deviation is due to the cost of the seismic activity in the country, very serious this year and to migration inflows,\u201d Moscovici told a news conference. \u201cWe will take that into account,\u201d he said. The pound\u2019s renewed dip came after an early gain in the immediate aftermath of the UK unemployment figures. Chris Saint, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, said: Sterling has drifted lower against the euro and US dollar during European trading hours this morning, finding itself back around the \u20ac1.16 and US$1.24 levels by midday. There was some tentative support for the pound after today\u2019s UK labour market figures, but the gains were short-lived...On the face of it the headline numbers suggest the jobs market has remained buoyant in the first few months since the EU referendum, although the data probably does little to alter the Bank of England\u2019s future policy path at this stage as pay growth is still relatively contained. The stronger dollar has helped send the oil price lower, after a surge in crude on Tuesday. Talk of an informal meeting on Friday in Doha between oil producers to prepare plans for an output agreement later this month had sent crude soaring around 5% on Tuesday. But the dollar strength, along with news from the American Petroleum Institute that US crude stocks jumped by 3.6m barrels last week rather than showing the expected 1.5m rise, has send crude slipping lower again. Brent is down 1.13% at $46.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 1.2% lower at $45.23. The dollar continues to strengthen as the odds of a US interest rate rise next month continue to shorten. Federal Reserve board member James Bullard is the latest to back an increase, saying that unless there are any major shocks, rates will be hiked. Given how the market has reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in the US election, it is hard to know what major shock would upset the market at this point. But Bullard, who was in London as a UBS banking conference, added that a single rate rise might be enough to move monetary policy to a neutral setting. So the dollar index - against a basket of currencies - has hit a 14 year high of 100.52, while the pound is down 0.17% to $1.2431. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said: The strength in the dollar index does represent a risk for the emerging markets and it can also eat into corporate profit for the US firms. The current move is also massively backed by bets that the Fed is going to raise the interest rate and odds are standing at 94%. It is important to keep in mind that come in December, it is the tone of the Fed for the future trajectory of the interest rate hike which is going to impact the dollar. And here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take on the figures: All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market performed in the first three months after the EU referendum. Unemployment has continued to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome. That said, the tone of next week\u2019s autumn statement will be that big challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National Statistics. UK unemployment falls to 11-year low Read more One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive people \u2013 those who have dropped out of the workforce \u2013 in the latest quarter. Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of unemployment in October. Here\u2019s our report on the UK jobs data. Phillip Inman writes: Unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain\u2019s employers have largely shrugged off the June Brexit vote. In the first health check of the labour market covering the three months since the referendum, official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the lowest since September 2005 and down from 4.9% in August and 5.3% a year earlier. Employment remained at a record high of 74.5% and annual wages rises, excluding bonuses, also nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. But the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had slowed dramatically. The full story is here: Britain\u2019s army of self-employed workers has swelled by over 4.5% in the last 12 months, which is a concern given recent revelations about life in the Gig economy. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that the self-employment total jumped by 213,000 in the last 12 months to 4.79 million, or 15.1% of all workers. In contrast, the number of employees rose by 256,000 to 26.82 million. These self-employed workers don\u2019t enjoy the benefits of employed workers, such as sickness and holiday pay and the minimum wage -- as was highlighted by protests by Deliveroo drivers and the successful court case brought by two Uber drivers. And figures released last month show that self-employed people are actually receiving less than 15 years ago [their pay is not included in the earnings figures]. The government has asked Matthew Taylor, a former top advisor to Tony Blair, to investigate the whole issue. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says Britain simply hasn\u2019t kept pace with the rise in self-employment. These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the social security system, such as on maternity pay. FSB is pleased with the announcement of the Taylor Review and we are looking forward to inputting into this.\u201d Over in parliament, Theresa May has hailed today\u2019s unemployment figures, at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. May argues: The unemployment figures show the strength of the fundamental of our economy The employment rate has never been higher, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest in a decade. May also reminded the Commons that search giant Google has just announced it will create 3,000 new jobs, as it builds a new HQ in Kings Cross. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage: Several economists are concerned that British pay packets will be gnawed by inflation next year. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that total pay rose by 2.3% over the last year, unchanged on a month earlier. That\u2019s more than inflation, which fell to 0.9% in October. But inflation is likely to jump to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Bank of England\u2019s latest forecasts, which would erode earnings growth. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that bosses won\u2019t be able to provide inflation-busting pay rises: \u201cAnnual pay growth remained at 2.3% on a three-month average basis, suggesting that workers are in a weak position to offset what is likely to be a sizeable rise in inflation over the next year. Indeed, the capacity of employers to pay more will not be supported by continued weak productivity growth. Overall, prospects of the labour market taking a turn for the worse in the not-too distant future are looking more likely.\u201d TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is also worried that real pay growth is stalling, as inflation picks up \u201cReal pay growth is the slowest it\u2019s been since early 2015. Wages are not growing fast enough to withstand the rise in inflation expected next year. Without swift action from the government, working people could soon by paying the price for Brexit with another fall in living standards. The jobless rate in Wales has inched up to 4.4%, from 4.3% a month ago, due to a 3,000 increase in unemployment. But more encouragingly, 19,000 more people were in work than three months earlier. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones argues that the principality is outperforming the rest of the country. \u201cYear on year, Wales has outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to improvements in employment, unemployment and economic inactivity. \u201cUnemployment in Wales, at 4.4%, is lower than in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland and remains well below the UK average. Meanwhile the employment rate remains close to its record high, with 41,000 more people in work across Wales than at this same time last year. Unemployment amongst 18 to 24 year-olds in Wales is down 9.1% on the year and there are also 19,000 fewer people economically inactive than a year ago. This graph, from the BBC, shows how Wales jobless rate dipped to just 4.1% over the summer: Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at The Work Foundation, has delved into the labour market report to find some interesting details: The labour market statistics indicate that the labour market remains remarkably stable. The rolling three month measure of unemployment shows a fall of some 37,000 over the most recent quarter, with the rate of unemployment now at 4.8%. The unemployment fall has been widely distributed across the country, though there were increases in both the North West and the East. For the UK as a whole, both full-time and part-time employee numbers increased by 31000. The large gains in employment have all been in the service sector \u2013 notably in the retail, hospitality and professional/scientific/technical areas. Britain\u2019s public sector has continued to shrink, to its smallest size in at least 17 years. Today\u2019s figures show that there were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector in June, 13,000 fewer than in March. That\u2019s the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, also fears that unemployment will rise in 2017, even though there\u2019s no sign of a Brexit shock yet: \u201cUnemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, and we could yet see a modest rise in the jobless total next year as uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations dampens business investment and slows overall economic growth. But we do not expect the UK economy to go into recession, so would not expect any large increases in unemployment. Several City experts are concerned that the number of Britons signing on for unemployment benefit jumped by almost 10,000 last month. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group says it\u2019s an \u2018early warning sign\u2019 of problems ahead. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that UK unemployment will rise in the next few months: The UK\u2019s labour market continues to surprise with its resilience to the Brexit shock. The unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a new 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to September. This is yet more evidence that the labour market and the wider economy have fared better than expected since June\u2019s referendum. However, there could be storm clouds gathering on the horizon. The claimant count \u2013 which in a quirk of the data is a more recent figure than the unemployment rate \u2013 jumped by 9,800 in October, with September\u2019s figure revised upwards from 700 to 5,600. All in all, it does seem likely that unemployment could tick up somewhat during the coming months, though dire predictions made in the immediate aftermath of the vote appear wide of the mark. David Cheetham of trading firm XTB.com is also concerned: The rise in the claimant count change - which is a fairer representation of the current environment as this data point covers the period until the end of last month - takes the shine off the good news at the very least and possibly even usurps it. In rising to 9.8k, this indicator came in at its highest level since November 2012 and when you also consider the upward revision of the prior print (to 5.6k from 0.7k) this could be taken as a warning sign that everything may not be quite as rosy as it appears for the labour market.\u201d ONS statistician David Freeman has sounded an important note of caution. He points out that employment growth is slowing; just 49,000 people found work in the July-September quarter, which is the slowest rate since March. \u201cUnemployment is at its lowest for more than ten years, and the employment rate remains at a record high. Nonetheless, there are signs that the labour market might be cooling, with employment growth slowing. Freedman also points out that there\u2019s no sign that the Brexit vote has cut the number of EU workers in Britain: \u201dThe Labour Force Survey also includes information on the nationality and country of birth of workers. That limited evidence suggests the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force. As this chart shows, the number of workers from other EU countries in Britain rose by 221,000 in the last year, to 2.26m, while the number of nationals from non-EU nations rose by 20,000 to 1.23 million. Employment minister Damian Hinds has hailed the news that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate since July to September 2005. Hinds says: \u201cYet again we have a strong set of figures, with employment continuing to run at a record high and unemployment falling to an 11-year low. \u201cGrowth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK labour market. \u201cThe measures we have taken have put our economy in a position of strength, and we will work to ensure more people can benefit from these opportunities as we build a country that works for everyone.\u201d Today\u2019s unemployment report shows that the number of people in work rose in the last quarter, and the number of people out of work fell. That kept the employment rate at a record high, but There were 31.80 million people in work, 49,000 more than for April to June 2016 and 461,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 23.24 million people working full-time, 350,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.56 million people working part-time, 110,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate was 74.5%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.60 million unemployed people, 37,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 146,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 4.8%, down from 5.3% for a year earlier and the lowest since July to September 2005. There were 803,300 people claiming unemployment-related benefits in October, up from 793,00 in September. Both men and women benefitted from the drop in unemployment, as this chart shows: There are now 876,000 men classed as unemployed men, 15,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 82,000 fewer than for a year earlier. And there are 728,000 unemployed women, 22,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 64,000 fewer than for a year earlier. We have a small, and welcome, rise in average earnings too. Average pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.4% annually in the July-September quarter, up from 2.3%. But pay including bonuses rose by 2.3%, matching last month\u2019s figures. The number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has jumped, by much more than economists expected. The claimant count rose by 9,800 in October, the ONS reports. And September\u2019s number has been revised up too; 5,600 people signed on for benefits, not the 700 first reported. Breaking: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8% in the three months to September. That\u2019s a new 11-year low, down from 4.9% a month earlier. More to follow... Barratt Development have sent a shiver through the UK property market this morning by revealing it has cut the price of some high-end London properties, worth over \u00a31m. Barratt CEO David Thomas told shareholders that. \u201cMarket conditions in London at higher selling prices remain more challenging. To mitigate these risks we have taken pricing action on a number of our sites in London.\u201d Thomas explains that prices have been cut by 5% to 10% on a few of its most expensive, centrally located London sites in zones one and two. The company has 385 sites in the UK, about 20 of which are in London, with six or seven classed as higher-end in the capital. The wider market, though, is still performing well since the Brexit vote, Barratt said, with \u201cconsumer demand is strong supported by good mortgage availability\u201d But the City isn\u2019t impressed; Barratt shares have fallen over 2% this morning, with rival builders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey shedding over 1%. One of the big threats facing Britain\u2019s labour market is the risk that City banks start to shift operations across to Europe, following the EU referendum. So it\u2019s encouraging that Swiss bank UBS isn\u2019t poised to flee London. Chairman Axel Weber told a conference this morning that: \u201cWe are not planning to change anything any time soon and we will wait and see where the dust settles\u201d Weber (who used to run Germany\u2019s central bank) also predicted that the Brexit process will be volatile, with the key decisions only made at the climax of negotiations. Over in Athens, they\u2019re getting ready to welcome US president Barack Obama to the historic Acropolis site - by imposing a massive security clampdown in the area. Obama will then give a speech to the Greek people, which will probably cover Europe\u2019s migration crisis, and Greece\u2019s own financial crisis. Last night, there were clashes in Athens as groups of protestors demonstrated against Obama\u2019s visit: Ocado\u2019s share price is getting an early morning drubbing, down almost 5%. The online supermarket is suffering because Morrisons have just announced a new deal with Amazon, to deliver shopping to its Prime customers within two hours (in parts of London and Hertfordshire anyway). Morrisons\u2019 shares jumped over 1% at the open, with ETX analyst Neil Wilson calling it a \u201cpotential game-changing tie-up\u201d. It\u2019s pure profit for the supermarket - the scheme is \u201ccapital light\u201d and will contribute to a \u00a350m-\u00a3100m incremental profit opportunity outlined in the 2015/16 preliminary results. This is a big money-spinner for Morrisons and gives it a massive edge over Tesco and Sainsbury in the home delivery market. With prices being slashed and competition fierce, this is the kind of deal that will make a big difference to the bottom line. Retail analyst Mark Brumby says the service could be another blow to Ocado (which also has a delivery deal with Morrisons). There\u2019s no drama in the financial markets this morning. The pound is bobbing around the $1.247 mark this morning, up a measly 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 index has dipped by just 7 points to 6785. Everyone\u2019s waiting for the jobs report at 9.30am, says Conner Campbell of Spreadex, even though it may not be too dramatic Both the unemployment rate and wage growth readings are forecast to remain unchanged at 2.3% (though it could creep a bit higher to 2.4%) and 4.9% respectively; the jobless claims figure, on the other hand, is set to see a bit more movement, rising to 1,900 from the 700 seen the month previous. RBC Capital Markets believe Britain\u2019s unemployment rate may have actually fallen in the July-September quarter to 4.8%, a new 11-year low. That would cause much celebration on Downing Street, I\u2019m sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean that next year won\u2019t be tough, RBC say: The unemployment rate could actually fall this month to 4.8% from 4.9%. The headline rate is the average of the last three single-month estimates and with the last two months both printing at 4.7% it looks highly likely that we see a tick down by one-tenth. This does though feel more like a short-term quirk than reflective of the outlook where a more challenging macroeconomic outlook in 2017 should put some modest upward pressure on unemployment. Accordingly our expectation for the range of employment gains over the last three months is 60-100k as a central case. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale doesn\u2019t expect many fireworks at 9.30am, though, predicting that: We\u2019re looking for unemployment and wage growth both to be pretty unchanged, which wouldn\u2019t provide any obvious support for the pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s labour market has been surprisingly resilient to the shock of the EU referendum, with the unemployment rate remaining low but wage growth somewhat modest. So the big news this morning should be the latest jobs report, due at 9.30am. It will show if this trend continued into the Autumn, or if there are signs that Brexit is now hurting Economists predict that the unemployment rate remained at 4.9% in the three months to September. That would match last month\u2019s 11-year low, and reassure the City about the state of the UK economy. The more timely claimant count report is expected to show that 2,000 more people signed on for unemployment benefit in October; any rise might indicate that firms are starting to cut jobs. But the real story could come in the earnings figures. Average wages over the last year may have risen by 2.4% (both including and excluding bonuses), up from 2.3%. We saw yesterday that inflation has dipped to 0.9%, but economists still expect it to rise over 2% in 2017. If wages don\u2019t keep pace, households face another real wage squeeze soon. Also coming up.... Barack Obama is due to give a speech in Athens, and tour the Acropolis, as his final tour of Europe continues. Yesterday, the outgoing US president put more pressure on Greece\u2019s creditors to offer meaningful debt relief -- an issue which may not be top of his successor\u2019s agenda. And in the corporate world, we\u2019re getting results from housebuilder Barratt, engine-maker Rolls-Royce, commercial property firm British Land and City broker ICAP.",

                "bodyText":"There is a lot of fake news around on social media these days, but there is a specific reason why we cannot be 100% certain that the owner of Snapchat has filed for an initial public offering (IPO), or flotation. Regulations in the US allow companies with revenues of less than $1bn (\u00a3800m) to keep the process private in its early stages. Snap, as the parent is called, falls into that category, thus the plan to go public has not been announced, merely hinted at. Hold on, you might say, if Snapchat isn\u2019t even bringing in $1bn-a-year in revenue how can it possibly be worth the rumoured $20bn-$25bn? Well, quite.

                "bodyText":"A surprise leap in retail sales volumes last month has boosted hopes the UK economy will end the year on a high note, as consumers continue to shrug off the shock of the Brexit vote. A rush to buy winter clothes and buoyant Halloween trade for supermarkets helped UK retail sales grow at the fastest annual pace for 14 years in October, according to official figures. Defying gloomy predictions before the EU referendum that a vote to leave could spark recession, the figures showed households continued to increase their spending last month and retail sales volumes were up 7.4% on a year earlier. That was the strongest growth since early 2002 and beat forecasts for growth of 5.3% in a Reuters poll of economists. On the month, sales were up by 1.9%, well ahead of forecasts for a 0.4% rise. But economists were quick to warn the growth would be hard to sustain. The Office for National Statistics said there were several factors behind the October improvement. \u201cCooler temperatures in October boosted clothing sales as shoppers took their cue to purchase winter clothing, while the supermarkets benefited from Halloween. This has also coincided with the strongest growth in internet sales seen for five years,\u201d said Kate Davies, an ONS senior statistician. The jump in sales on a year ago came as all types of retailers, from grocers to petrol stations, enjoyed some growth. The biggest contribution came from non-store retailing, which includes market stalls and mail order as well as internet-only retailers such as Amazon. Average weekly spending online was \u00a31bn, an increase of 26.8% compared with October 2015. Separate figures from online retail trade body IMRG showed home goods performed particularly well last month, with spending up 24% on the year. \u201cThis could have been spurred by a deteriorating pound, with people more focused on domestic home improvements rather than spending on holidays abroad \u2013 which have become a lot more expensive since the Brexit vote,\u201d IMRG said, in its monthly sales snapshot published with consultancy Capgemini. Economists said the overall rise in retail sales was encouraging for the economy\u2019s growth prospects in the final quarter of this year, but there were warnings that consumer spending could slow next year. \u201cClearly, this is a great start to fourth quarter GDP on the spending side,\u201d said Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London. He said the weak pound may have played a role as it continues to attract tourists to the UK looking to snap up luxury items. \u201cIt could also be consumers bringing forward spending to today, in anticipation of higher prices tomorrow,\u201d he added. After official inflation data this week came in weaker than economists expected, showing that prices rose by 0.9% year on year in October, the ONS said retail figures showed there were falls in average prices across all store types last month, except petrol stations. But the drop in average store prices was the smallest for more than two years at 0.7% and will be taken as a further sign the UK\u2019s long spell of very low inflation is coming to an end. The drop in sterling against other currencies since the Brexit vote has raised import costs to the UK and been passed on to consumers in the prices of household goods including Marmite. That would make October\u2019s \u201cmini-boom\u201d for retailers hard to repeat, said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit. \u201cSuch strong growth is clearly unsustainable, and cracks are in fact already appearing. Survey data highlight how households are struggling to support existing spending due to weak income growth and rising prices, and how this negative trend is likely to intensify in coming months,\u201d he said.",

                "bodyText":"This year\u2019s Black Friday will be the biggest yet as shoppers snap up large items such as fridges before Brexit-induced price rises take effect in January, the boss of AO World has predicted. John Roberts, the online retailer\u2019s chief executive, said price rises were inevitable after the pound\u2019s plunge against other major currencies since the EU referendum. Suppliers were starting to charge more and shoppers would feel the full impact by the end of January, he said. AO\u2019s founder said the expectation of imminent price rises would add to consumer willingness to buy new products in the shopping frenzy around the last Friday of November. The period of heavy discounts has taken off since the tradition was imported from the US in 2010. Roberts said: \u201cIt has been well reported that with Brexit currency movements prices are going up early next year, so there is a double whammy for customers. So our belief is it will be bigger than ever.\u201d AO posted a \u00a31.1m operating loss for the six months to the end of September, with an \u00a311.1m UK profit erased by a \u00a312.2m loss in mainland Europe, where it is expanding in Germany and the Netherlands. The group recorded a \u00a36.8m loss a year earlier but Roberts predicted the European business would turn a profit in 2020. The pound\u2019s fall against the dollar, the euro and other currencies since the Brexit vote is pushing up prices of goods from Marmite to guitars as suppliers charge more to make up for sterling\u2019s reduced value. Rising prices threaten to squeeze living standards and slow the economy but retail sales are holding up better than expected, with Christmas a few weeks away. Britons are expected to spend \u00a32.9bn over the four days from Friday 25 November, 38% more than on Black Friday weekend last year, according to the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. Most of the extra sales will be made online as shoppers shun the chaos and occasional punch-ups in stores by ordering from their computer or mobile device. Some retailers are phasing their discounts or seeking to play down Black Friday. Amazon, which brought the craze to the UK, is spreading its offers over two weeks while Asda has largely opted out, as it did last year.

While Thanksgiving and Black Friday are expected to rake in more digital dollars, Cyber Monday \u2013 officially 28 November \u2013 is forecast to be the largest sales day of the year, at $3.36bn, according to Adobe Digital Insights. </p> <p>And we are really talking about a sales shopping season now, not single big days. Cyber Monday, started as a marketing ploy to encourage online shopping, now really starts on Black Friday for many online retailers, and retail giant Walmart is kicking off a \u201cCyber Week\u201d at one second past midnight on Thanksgiving Day itself.</p> <p>Confused? You should be, says consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow. Black Friday is no longer the defined or defining retail event it once was. </p> <p>Black Friday \u201cbargains\u201d are planned promotional price adjustments mixed in with a couple of loss-leaders, Yarrow says, but the real bargains start with Cyber Monday and last through to the December holidays. And whereas Black Friday deals used to be restricted to a retailer\u2019s stores, those same deals are often now found simultaneously online. </p> <p>Taking a lead from Amazon, this year Walmart plans to up its sales offering from 8m items to more than 23m. And they\u2019ll be available 18 hours before Walmart\u2019s door-buster deals go on sale in stores at 6pm. \u201cBlack Friday lost its identity and oomph. It\u2019s overhyped and online shopping has stolen its thunder,\u201d Yarrow says.</p> <p>Part of the trend, says Yarrow, is that retailers and consumers are bargain-obsessed and started their sales soon after Halloween. At the same time, \u201cthe deals are pretty much the same as last year and really, how many big-screen TVs do we need?\u201d</p> <p>The National Retail Federation president, Matthew Shay, says retailers answered consumers\u2019 demand for promotions by offering Black Friday deals as soon as the day after Halloween. According to the NRF, half of all consumers have already started gift-shopping. </p> <p>\u201cThis time of year is about finding the right gifts while staying on budget,\u201d says Shay. </p> <p>While the shopping season is shifting, the number of consumers planning to shop remains staggering. The NRF survey found that 21% of weekend shoppers plan to shop on Thanksgiving Day, nearly the same as last year\u2019s 22%. But Black Friday will remain the busiest day of the holiday weekend with 74% planning to shop that day. </p> <p>The trend for shopping earlier in the season is being driven by millennials, with 86% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 78% of 25- to 34-year-olds planning to shop on Black Friday. </p> <p>For this group, online shopping on Thanksgiving is a holiday tradition and shopping remains a social experience, whether in-store or online with the aid of social media. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/ivanka-trump-grab-your-wallet-shoes-com-bellacor\">Ivanka Trump boycott campaign #GrabYourWallet claims retail victory</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cIt\u2019s the only experiential moment retailers offer them during the holiday season that they can share with friends and family and then share it with the rest of the world on social media,\u201d says Ana Serafin Smith at the National Retail Federation. </p> <p>Counterintuitively, the key for retailers to get millennials into stores has been to boost their online presence, says Smith. Then the excitement of the sales retail experience \u2013 large crowds, new products and the opportunity to interact with other consumers who are interested in the same items \u2013 kicks in. </p> <p>\u201cThe biggest hurdle retailers had to go through was getting online. As they started to improve the quantity of products online to what they had in the store allowed them to connect because millennials love to do a lot of their research online and then walk into the store to purchase it. It reaffirms their decision that to spend, say $1,000 on a new Samsung TV, is the best decision for them,\u201d says Smith.</p> <p>Retailers have further learned to mix up the deals they offer online or in the stores to allow them to get traffic through both. \u201cThat way they can appeal to all the different types of modern consumers we have now,\u201d says Smith. Some only want to buy in store, others online, so retailers have learnt to incentivize both. </p> <p> \u201cThat\u2019s the retailers\u2019 way of showing that they\u2019re listening to their customers and paying attention to what they like and don\u2019t like.\u201d <br></p> <p>One thing in retailers\u2019 favor, retail analysts believe, is the end of the election season. According to HookLogic, e-commerce dropped 5% year-on-year the day before the election, 16% the day of the election itself, and 23% the day after. </p> <p>But in the period since, confidence has rebounded and with it shopping. By the Thursday after the election, e-commerce spending was up 24%. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a long, tough election,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cNo matter if your candidate won or lost most seem to want a respite \u2013 even an escape. Add to that a relatively stable sense of personal economic security and I think it\u2019ll be a solid holiday shopping season.\u201d </p>",

Confused? You should be, says consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow. Black Friday is no longer the defined or defining retail event it once was. Black Friday \u201cbargains\u201d are planned promotional price adjustments mixed in with a couple of loss-leaders, Yarrow says, but the real bargains start with Cyber Monday and last through to the December holidays. And whereas Black Friday deals used to be restricted to a retailer\u2019s stores, those same deals are often now found simultaneously online. Taking a lead from Amazon, this year Walmart plans to up its sales offering from 8m items to more than 23m. And they\u2019ll be available 18 hours before Walmart\u2019s door-buster deals go on sale in stores at 6pm. \u201cBlack Friday lost its identity and oomph. It\u2019s overhyped and online shopping has stolen its thunder,\u201d Yarrow says. Part of the trend, says Yarrow, is that retailers and consumers are bargain-obsessed and started their sales soon after Halloween. At the same time, \u201cthe deals are pretty much the same as last year and really, how many big-screen TVs do we need?\u201d The National Retail Federation president, Matthew Shay, says retailers answered consumers\u2019 demand for promotions by offering Black Friday deals as soon as the day after Halloween. According to the NRF, half of all consumers have already started gift-shopping. \u201cThis time of year is about finding the right gifts while staying on budget,\u201d says Shay. While the shopping season is shifting, the number of consumers planning to shop remains staggering. The NRF survey found that 21% of weekend shoppers plan to shop on Thanksgiving Day, nearly the same as last year\u2019s 22%. But Black Friday will remain the busiest day of the holiday weekend with 74% planning to shop that day. The trend for shopping earlier in the season is being driven by millennials, with 86% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 78% of 25- to 34-year-olds planning to shop on Black Friday. For this group, online shopping on Thanksgiving is a holiday tradition and shopping remains a social experience, whether in-store or online with the aid of social media. \u201cIt\u2019s the only experiential moment retailers offer them during the holiday season that they can share with friends and family and then share it with the rest of the world on social media,\u201d says Ana Serafin Smith at the National Retail Federation. Counterintuitively, the key for retailers to get millennials into stores has been to boost their online presence, says Smith. Then the excitement of the sales retail experience \u2013 large crowds, new products and the opportunity to interact with other consumers who are interested in the same items \u2013 kicks in. \u201cThe biggest hurdle retailers had to go through was getting online. As they started to improve the quantity of products online to what they had in the store allowed them to connect because millennials love to do a lot of their research online and then walk into the store to purchase it. It reaffirms their decision that to spend, say $1,000 on a new Samsung TV, is the best decision for them,\u201d says Smith. Retailers have further learned to mix up the deals they offer online or in the stores to allow them to get traffic through both. \u201cThat way they can appeal to all the different types of modern consumers we have now,\u201d says Smith. Some only want to buy in store, others online, so retailers have learnt to incentivize both. \u201cThat\u2019s the retailers\u2019 way of showing that they\u2019re listening to their customers and paying attention to what they like and don\u2019t like.\u201d One thing in retailers\u2019 favor, retail analysts believe, is the end of the election season. According to HookLogic, e-commerce dropped 5% year-on-year the day before the election, 16% the day of the election itself, and 23% the day after. But in the period since, confidence has rebounded and with it shopping. By the Thursday after the election, e-commerce spending was up 24%. \u201cIt was a long, tough election,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cNo matter if your candidate won or lost most seem to want a respite \u2013 even an escape. Add to that a relatively stable sense of personal economic security and I think it\u2019ll be a solid holiday shopping season.\u201d",

Guardian reporters hit the shops early this morning to find much calmer scenes, and small or no queues.</p> <p>However, retailers are reporting a big surge in online sales, as people shop on their mobile phones to get the best deals.</p> <p>Andy Brian, partner at retail specialist law firm Gordons, explains: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that we didn\u2019t have people queuing to get into stores like in previous years. This is partly because more retailers opted to spread out their deals over a longer period, but it\u2019s also because of the growth of online and mobile shopping. Black Friday has still captured the attention of shoppers this year and it seems the appetite for a bargain is still there \u2013 but how consumers shop for those bargains is changing.</p> <p>People don\u2019t have to wait until the stores open. Instead, they can search for deals at home or on their way to work \u2013 and the online trading figures for the early hours of Black Friday seem to show this was the case more than ever this year. </p> </blockquote> <p>The lack of crowds reminded one reader of the launch of the iPhone 7 at Apple\u2019s Viborg store in Denmark: </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmrlqyvselQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmrlqyvselQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That\u2019s it for today.

                "bodyText":"As Black Friday sales continue across the UK, we\u2019re going to close up for the day. We haven\u2019t had the unseemly shop-floor scenes of 2014, as people scrapped to get their hands on the best deals. Guardian reporters hit the shops early this morning to find much calmer scenes, and small or no queues. However, retailers are reporting a big surge in online sales, as people shop on their mobile phones to get the best deals. Andy Brian, partner at retail specialist law firm Gordons, explains: It\u2019s no surprise that we didn\u2019t have people queuing to get into stores like in previous years. This is partly because more retailers opted to spread out their deals over a longer period, but it\u2019s also because of the growth of online and mobile shopping. Black Friday has still captured the attention of shoppers this year and it seems the appetite for a bargain is still there \u2013 but how consumers shop for those bargains is changing. People don\u2019t have to wait until the stores open. Instead, they can search for deals at home or on their way to work \u2013 and the online trading figures for the early hours of Black Friday seem to show this was the case more than ever this year. The lack of crowds reminded one reader of the launch of the iPhone 7 at Apple\u2019s Viborg store in Denmark: That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a great weekend. AM appliancesdirect.co.uk says customers are taking advantage of Black Friday to make savings on big ticket items. Since midnight it has sold more than 4,000 blenders, over 2,000 washing machines, and 1,000 4K HD televisions. Mark Kelly, marketing manager, says demand has been strong as consumers want to buy big ticket items now before consumer prices start to pick up next year: We anticipated strong sales, but the popularity in cut price home appliances this year has surpassed our expectations. Shoppers have taken full advantage of thousands of pounds of savings on big ticket items in anticipation of price rises in technology early next year as a result of the exchange rate changes following the referendum result. Amazon reported brisk online sales as a result of its latest deals, as part of its extended Black Friday sale which started on 14 November and with new offers launched every day since. The top deals running today include discounts on bestselling Alexa \u2018hands-free\u2019 devices Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, with Echo available for just \u00a3119.99, and Echo Dot available for just \u00a339.99. Doug Gurr, Amazon\u2019s UK country manager, commented: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very positive customer response to the thousands of deals during our extended 12 day Black Friday Sale and customers have been snapping up lots of our great deals on offer since midnight. From the company\u2019s Peterborough distribution warehouse Paul Firth, Amazon\u2019s head of music, said health and beauty products and toys were also doing well. Three of the top five best-selling items in its sports section were Fitbit Flex activity trackers (up to 50% off) while electric tootbrushes (up to 76% off) accounted for three of the top five beauty items. Star Wars toys and games were also snapped up, alongside the Disney Rapunzel doll with glowing hair. Like other retailers Amazon has completely sold out of this year\u2019s must-have toy, Hatchimals. \u201cPeople are also buying practical and essential things such as PC memory cards and wi-fi extenders\u201d Firth said. Last year in the UK Amazon sold 7.4 million items on Black Friday - 86 items every second. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell what the picture is\u201d Firth added. \u201cBut it certainly all looks very busy. Busy, but ordered\u2026.\u201d At Peterborough, the 1,000 staff had been bolstered by another 2,000 to ensure no hitches with picking and packing during this key trading period. Football clubs are embracing Black Friday, with many offering 20% off kit and other merchandise in their shops and online. Leicester City, reigning Premier League champions, have got their own twist: Some more Black Friday stats, this time from Very.co.uk: 15 consoles sold every minute A smartwatch sold every 12 seconds 21 bottles of perfume every minute A set of curling tongs sold every 8 seconds Currys PC World says it had more than half a million visitors to its website before 6am. The two most popular products have been the Google Chromecast and the JVC 32C660 32\u201d Smart LED TV. Stuart Ramage, e-commerce director at Dixons Carphone: We\u2019ve been preparing for today for almost a year now to ensure the best deals for our customers. We continue to break records with orders already up 40% year-on-year since 2015, and as we predicted, shoppers are making the most of our stores being open early, but also placing orders by mobile devices with our highest ever mobile traffic share since Black Friday began. Argos says its busiest hour so far was between 8am and 9am, when it received about 700,000 web visits (80% of which were on mobiles and tablets). Popular products include iPads, PS4, xbox, Dyson vacuum cleaners and Beats headphones. It also expects TVs and toys to among the best sellers. Lunchtime is expected to mark another peak, and then 5pm to 7pm as people make their way home from work. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive at retail marketing agency, Savvy, is at the Argos distribution centre in Barton. I\u2019ve been here since 5.30am where there\u2019s a sense of great calm and slick organisation despite this being the biggest and busiest day of the year for Argos. With 800-plus staff on site during this peak week they\u2019re expecting to pick over two million items and over 330,000 today. With business operating 24/7 the Barton distribution centre will process 15,000 parcels an hour alone. Not all retailers are slashing prices today, with some taking a different approach to the US-inspired discount day. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler reports: Outdoor brands Patagonia and Braintree, as well as fashion chain FatFace, will be donating proceeds from the day to charity while Jigsaw and Next have both announced they will not be offering discounts. Meanwhile Berghaus is encouraging its customers to head outdoors as an alternative to the shopping frenzy. Patagonia will be donating its entire global sales income from its own website and stores on 25 November to 80 grassroots environmental organisations around the world, including Surfers against Sewage and London Waterkeeper in the UK. \u201cAs people think generously about family and friends, we also want to help our customers show love to the planet, which badly needs a gift or two,\u201d the company said. Full story here: It may be Black Friday but for some, it\u2019s all about Giving Tuesday. Giving Tuesday (this year on 29 November) began five years ago in the US as an antidote to the consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) brought it to the UK for the first time 2014, and is today calling on Black Friday shoppers to support a cause they care about next Tuesday. Hannah Terrey, head of policy and campaigns at CAF, says: After the frenzy of festive consumerism, #givingtuesday is a day for everyone to \u2018do good stuff\u2019 for a cause they care about, whether that\u2019s donating money, volunteering time or simply talking about their favourite charities. Just like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, #givingtuesday has now firmly established itself as a regular fixture in the festive calendar. It is great to see that even more people are planning to take some time over Christmas to give something back to a good cause. Shoppers heading into Poundland expecting some Black Friday bargains for less than \u00a31 are in for a shock. Poundland\u2019s surprises include - for the first time - a range of products with price tags exceeding the standard \u00a31. The discount retailer says it is the \u201cperfect destination to snap up a bargain this Black Friday\u201d, which include up to 65% on perfumes and fragrances, including a 50 ml bottle of Eau de Gaga which can be snapped up for just \u00a38, compared with the RRP of \u00a332. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says the positive survey from the CBI suggests the economy is holding up in the fourth quarter, following growth of 0.5% in the third. He does, however, add a note of caution: A buoyant November CBI Distributive Trades survey points to consumers still splashing out in the fourth quarter, thereby boosting hopes that GDP growth will hold up well. Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers\u2019 willingness to spend holds up over the vital Christmas shopping period. The major problem facing the economy \u2013 and retailers in particular - is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will progressively weaken over the coming months with inflation rising markedly due to the weakened pound and companies likely increasingly looking to hold down pay to limit their total costs. The labour market also looks likely to come under mounting pressure despite its current resilience. In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are likely to rise appreciably over the coming months. Retail sales picked up pace in November and were stronger than expected according to the CBI\u2019s latest snapshot. Volumes increased at the fastest rate in more than a year in the 12 months to November, driven higher by sales of items including clothing, hardware and DIY. The distributive trades survey found that 42% of retailers reported a rise in sales compared with a year ago, while 16% said they were down. The resulting balance of +26% was the strongest since September 2015, and far stronger than the +26% forecast by City economists. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said November was a \u201cbuoyant\u201d month for sales. With the later onset of cold weather, shoppers stocking up their winter wardrobe has helped to boost high street sales. While we expect to see decent growth in the near term, retailers are keeping a close eye on price rises coming down the track and the impact on consumer spending.\u201d John Lewis says it has seen strong demand from shoppers so far today. The busiest period was between 8am and 8.30am, as people shopped on their way into work. The department store chain is taking five orders every second online. There was a particular spike in transactions completed on mobile phones, up 21% between 8am and 9am. Best-selling products: The Sonos Play 1 is the biggest technology seller, selling one every ten seconds The Lego Simpsons house is the top seller by value Marc Jacobs perfume is the strongest seller by number Sophie Conran crockery is the best seller in John Lewis\u2019s home department Home Dino Rocos, lead director and operations director at John Lewis, said online sales had \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d. Back to Black Friday. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, comments on how the event is changing: Black Friday in its original form \u2013 the manic one-day, in-store shopping experience \u2013 has already changed significantly over the past three years. We\u2019re seeing the continuation of that evolution in 2016 with retailers extending their sales either side of Black Friday, and the term \u2018Black Fiveday\u2019 becoming more commonplace, as well as a continuation of the trend towards online. Little movement in Europe\u2019s major markets this morning. With thin trading expected in the US following Thanksgiving, investors elsewhere appear to be taking a bit of a breather: FTSE 100: flat at 6,831 Germany\u2019s DAX: flat at 10,690 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 4,547 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 8,646 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 16,531 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 342 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: With US markets likely to be in a thin post-Thanksgiving mood there appears to be little in the way of positive drivers for European markets this morning. This lack of interest has seen markets in Europe trading listlessly, weighed down on the one hand by weakness in the banking sector and a decline in oil prices ahead of next week\u2019s OPEC meeting in Vienna. James Knightley, senior UK economist at ING, says the second half of 2016 should prove rosy overall, but come 2017 the economy is likely to take a turn for the worse. This is a firm growth story that again shows the economy has weathered the Brexit storm very well so far. The data flow so far suggests that the fourth quarter should also post a decent growth rate, but we still expect a substantial slowdown in 2017. Our main concern relates to a squeeze on household spending power brought about by a sharp pick-up in inflation that isn\u2019t matched by wage increases. We also expect a slowdown in hiring and investment by businesses as Brexit uncertainty kicks in and the political pressure rises once Article 50 is triggered. Here is a breakdown of how different parts of the economy performed in the third quarter, compared with the second. It grew by 0.5% overall (and 2.3% annually). Services sector output: +0.8% Industrial production: -0.5% Construction output: -1.1% Household spending: +0.7% Business investment: +0.9% Government spending: +0.4% Exports: +0.7% Imports: -1.5% The ONS has said there is no clear evidence yet to suggest the Brexit vote has had an impact on the economy. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, has commented on this morning\u2019s second estimate of growth. He makes the point that although business investment grew in Q3, most of those spending decisions will have been taken before the referendum, when the UK was expected to vote to remain in the EU: Investment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though it\u2019s likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day. That, coupled with growing consumer spending fuelled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.\u201d The Office for National Statistics has just published its second estimate of third-quarter growth, confirming a 0.5% increase in GDP. Business investment grew more than expected, by 0.9% over the quarter compared with expectations of 0.6%. It was a slight dip compared with business investment growth of 1% in the second quarter. More soon. Black Friday is also a thing in Brazil apparently. Photo evidence from S\u00e3o Paulo: In other news, we have a couple of bits of interesting data coming up in the UK this morning. At 9.30 the Office for National Statistics will publish its second estimate of GDP in the third quarter. It is expected to confirm that the economy grew 0.5% between July and September, unchanged from the first estimate. The ONS is also expected to confirm an annual rate of growth of 2.3% in the third quarter. The second estimate will reveal new data on the spending side of the economy, and will offer a glimpse on firms\u2019 willingness to spend in the months following the June Brexit vote. Business investment is expected to rise by 0.6% in the third quarter. At 11am the CBI will release its distributive trades survey for November. It is expected to show a slowdown in retail sales growth compared with October. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, gives his view on Black Friday: Well, it remains to be seen how busy the high street will be today, but the much-dreaded \u201cBlack Friday\u201d sale promotions this week will undoubtedly pull a lot of business forward from December, at lower margins, and it\u2019s tempting to agree with the comment to the BBC by Peter Ruis, the boss of fashion chain Jigsaw, that Black Friday is a \u201ccomplete and utter deception\u201d\u2026 Here\u2019s our latest news story: Retailers have shifted their approach to Black Friday since it arrived here in 2010 (thanks to Amazon). This year many BF discounts are not single-day offers but promotions that spread over days and weeks, with a bigger focus online. PCA Predict says there have been record breaking online transactions this morning, up 21% on last year between midnight and 7am. East London is home to the savviest shoppers, with the highest number of online transactions before breakfast, followed by Croydon and Birmingham. Mobiles have been the most popular device for deal-hunters so far but PCA Predict expect this could change to desktops over the day as consumers head into work. The top five busiest online shopping regions according to PCA: East London Croydon Birmingham Leicester Rotherham Back here in 2016, Black Friday appears to have moved online: My colleague Rupert Neate captured some of the madness of 2014 in this short video. Well worth a watch: Black Friday today is a far cry from the scenes we saw in stores in 2014, when there was an unseemly scramble for bargains such as televisions. Here\u2019s a reminder from two years ago: Guardian reporters have been out and about since the early hours, joining the Black Friday bargain hunters. My colleague Sarah Butler says its been \u201cmore of a saunter than a scramble\u201d at Tesco Extra in Streatham: While online retailers were busy, stores were off to a slow start. At the Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London, there were only 11 people in the queue when the supermarket opened at 5am - not many more than the number of security guards. Some of those queuing had been there since 4.30am and were surprised how few people had turned up compared to last year. Tony was queuing up for a Hatchimal after being unable to get one for his kids online. \u201cI\u2019ll either go home a hero of If they haven\u2019t got one I\u2019ll be home in bed in half an hour.\u201d Most of those in the queue were planning to pick up a TV from the large pile just inside the door. But it was more of a saunter than a scramble once the doors opened. Michael, who bought two TVs, said: \u201cThis is quiet, very calm. Last year at Sainsbury\u2019s it was crazy. I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u201d He said he was buying himself a TV for the second year in a row as the one he got last year broke. Martin, the store manager at Tesco in Streatham, said he was expecting sales to build through the day into the afternoon. He said hundreds more TVs would be delivered over the weekend. \u201cIt will give us additional spend later on when people come in to do their normal shop,\u201d he said. John Rogers, the new chief executive officer of Argos, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that there had been 500,000 visits to the retailer\u2019s website in the first hour of online trading between midnight and 1pm - up 50% on last year. He expects peak traffic between 7am and 10am as people shop on their mobile phones on their way to work. Rogers - the former finance director at Sainsbury\u2019s which has taken over the business - was speaking from Argos\u2019s distribution warehouse in Burton-on-Trent, as part of a whistlestop \u2018national tour\u2019 of its stores and facilities in the run-up to Christmas. For Black Friday itself, Argos has set up three \u201cwar rooms\u201d. One will monitor and tweak deals, one will oversee systems \u2013 standing ready to tackle any technical glitches - and the third will oversee communications with shoppers. Rogers predicts that Argos will take 70% or more of its orders online on that day, compared with 50% during normal trading, and that the company is better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Black Friday is here again, but this time without the shop-floor stampedes. Retailers are instead reporting a surge in online traffic as shoppers seek out the best bargains at the discount event that began in the US but has been adopted by the UK in recent years. Argos said there were half a million visitors to its website in the first hour of Black Friday trading. So far we haven\u2019t seen the queues and chaos in shops that characterised Black Friday in 2014. It\u2019s much more orderly this year. We will be bringing you updates on this, and other developments, as they happen.",

                "body":"<p>Ryanair may have learned to show a little love to its customers, but one group of people still gets the more traditional Ryanair treatment. Onstage in jumper and jeans in front of a crowd of suits at the Airport Operators Association conference, chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary slouched grumpily in a seat and announced: \u201cI\u2019ve got far better things to do than to talk to a bunch of overcharging airports.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, O\u2019Leary outlined his airline\u2019s plans: to cut fares and fly ever more people. That was, he said, \u201cgreat news for all the bankers and robbers assembled in this room who will not be reducing their charges, and who will all be making out like highwaymen and bandits as they continue to see rising passenger numbers at their airports, rising retail sales and rising restaurant sales. All on the back of the poor stupid Irish who will be carrying all these people at even lower prices.\u201d</p> <p>Bitter? Very. But after the tirades, O\u2019Leary shared a dream: \u201cI have this vision that in the next five to 10 years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/22/ryanair-flights-free-michael-oleary-airports\" title=\"\">fares on Ryanair will be free</a>; in which case the flights will be full, and we will be making our money out of sharing the airport revenues of all the people who will be running through airports, and getting a share of the shopping and the retail revenues.\u201d</p> <p>Could that dream ever become reality? Certainly, the tills have been flowing freely at Stansted airport, Ryanair\u2019s biggest UK base.</p> <p>The departure lounge, completed a year ago, is testament to the possibilities. The short distance to the departure gates can only be negotiated via a meandering trail through the duty-free. A hard right at Jo Malone takes you straight into the arms of the Jack Daniel\u2019s boutique, before sniffing the air through a chicane of Lanc\u00f4me and Est\u00e9e Lauder, into an oxbow bend through the fashion stores. Then it\u2019s one last loop through the food and drink \u2013 with millions stopping off at the third-most-lucrative Pret a Manger in Britain for the last decent sandwich before the airline trolley.</p> <p>This retail spending is the prize O\u2019Leary covets. The airports, however, reckon that Ryanair already gets its share. The owner of Stansted, Manchester Airports Group, signed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/17/ryanair-stansted-fare-cut-boost-growth\" title=\"\">10-year deal with Ryanair</a> soon after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/18/stansted-airport-sale-baa\" title=\"\">acquiring the airport for \u00a31.5bn in 2013.</a> In return for more passengers, Ryanair got lower charges. Alongside, the airport gave the terminal an \u00a380m transformation, adding 50% more space in the departure lounge. And the airline loosened up its notoriously tight policy on carry-on bags to allow people to bring their shopping aboard.</p> <p>Details of the deal aren\u2019t public, but Stansted\u2019s accounts suggest its structure has made additional passengers in effect free of charge for the airline, if not better. Almost 80% of Stansted\u2019s passengers now fly with Ryanair, and the airport\u2019s income from aeronautical charges fell from \u00a3148m to \u00a3141m this year, even as passenger numbers rose by 11% to 23.1&#xa0;million. But those 2 million more people passing through the doors kept shopping, with a higher average spending of \u00a35.70 per person (including parking) \u2013 meaning that Stansted\u2019s overall revenues still rose a healthy 5%.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the degree is different, but the principle holds. Nick Dunn, the chief financial officer of Gatwick airport, says: \u201cOur overall charges reflect the money we make in retail and parking: inherently, there is already discount or cross-subsidy there for airlines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"553d48074589be5ec95441bb6bbc8a264a761ef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/553d48074589be5ec95441bb6bbc8a264a761ef3/0_0_4430_2658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary: \u2019Im doing seat sales at \u00a34 and I\u2019m paying the \u00a313 APD. I\u2019m paying you to fly with me.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gatwick signed its own growth deal with its major customer, easyJet, with \u201cquite an incentive\u201d to bring in more passengers, particularly in the off-season. Ryanair only flies around 1 million of the airport\u2019s 43 million passengers a year, meaning Gatwick\u2019s focus can be on higher levels of service demanded by other airlines, with correspondingly higher charges (nearer \u00a39).</p> <p>Free won\u2019t happen here, O\u2019Leary admits: but where Ryanair can bring its clout, and where airports are desperate for growth, zero hour beckons.</p> <p>Aviation consultant John Strickland says: \u201cRyanair already negotiate the lowest charges, so if they want to share the retail pie then airports will be reluctant: they already use that income to subsidise charges. But if airlines can grow that pie, that would be a very attractive proposition. It would have to go beyond the airline-airport dynamic as it is today: they would have to jointly sell something new, by convincing airline customers to buy at the airport.\u201d</p> <p>To what extent Ryanair needs this is debatable. Its bargain fares have always been supplemented with expensive add-ons, from bags to booking fees, and \u201cfree\u201d fares are unlikely to be different, even if Ryanair has moderated its more punitive charges. Pre-booked bags still generate an undisclosed but sizeable chunk of the \u20ac3.2bn fare revenue Ryanair took in the first half of this year; ancillary revenues \u2013 from car hire to seat selection and onboard food \u2013 made almost \u20ac1bn more. But even those streams may soon look traditional.</p> <p>Already, says Strickland, \u201cmore than 20% of their revenues don\u2019t come from tickets anyway, but things we buy onboard or via their website. Their ambition is to be more like an Amazon.\u201d</p> <p>At Ryanair, the mantra is \u201cload factor active, yield passive\u201d \u2013 or fill the planes, whatever the fare. And more planes need to be filled, with a fleet growing to double passenger numbers to over 200m in a decade.</p> <p>That scale alone, says O\u2019Leary, means fares will fall. But that is just the start. Sales won\u2019t be just inflight or at the airport, or even the holiday \u2013 but capturing the customer for everyday transactions via My Ryanair, the registration database, for all manner of promotions.</p> <p>Alas, for most summer holidays, fares will remain far from free. But for the flexible, minimalist traveller to less fashionable airports, free fares could really mean free \u2013 and sooner rather than later if Britain does ever cut air passenger duty (APD), as airlines beg. \u201cIf I start getting that back, why not? I\u2019m doing seat sales this week at \u00a34 and I\u2019m paying the \u00a313 APD,\u201d growls O\u2019Leary. \u201cI\u2019m paying you to fly with me.\u201d</p> <h2>Costly extras</h2> <p><strong>Baggage</strong><br>Often an inescapable add-on for families and leisure travellers, although O\u2019Leary (again) claims to have done the world a service by weaning flyers off their luggage habit. Checked-in bags booked online will typically cost \u00a315-\u00a350 on Ryanair, rising to \u00a360 per bag at the airport. A 20kg bag will cost \u00a313-\u00a330 on easyJet. British Airways\u2019 fares normally include one checked-in suitcase of up to 23kg, although it has muddied the waters by offering \u201chand-baggage only\u201d fares in recent years. The hand-luggage allowance can also be a trap for the unwary: a heavy, small suitcase is fine on BA or easyJet, but it needs to weigh less than 10kg on Ryanair or Monarch. On Wizz, a small case as hand baggage still incurs a charge.</p> <p><strong>Seating</strong><br>On easyJet, it costs from \u00a31.99 simply to choose, rising to \u00a319.99 to pick the best seats. Ryanair charges \u00a315 for the best seats (\u00a322.50 if done at airport check-in) but picking any seat yourself will cost \u00a38. With BA\u2019s lowest-priced tickets, choosing seats costs an extra \u00a37.</p> <p><strong>Priority boarding</strong><br>This is wrapped in with choosing a premium seat on easyJet, but you can still pay another \u00a35 for the privilege at Ryanair.</p> <p><strong>Payment</strong><br>Using a credit rather than debit card means a 2% charge on Ryanair, 1% on easyJet. BA charges \u00a35 per ticket (not per booking) but will move to a 1% fee next month.</p>",

And the airline loosened up its notoriously tight policy on carry-on bags to allow people to bring their shopping aboard. Details of the deal aren\u2019t public, but Stansted\u2019s accounts suggest its structure has made additional passengers in effect free of charge for the airline, if not better. Almost 80% of Stansted\u2019s passengers now fly with Ryanair, and the airport\u2019s income from aeronautical charges fell from \u00a3148m to \u00a3141m this year, even as passenger numbers rose by 11% to 23.1 million. But those 2 million more people passing through the doors kept shopping, with a higher average spending of \u00a35.70 per person (including parking) \u2013 meaning that Stansted\u2019s overall revenues still rose a healthy 5%. Elsewhere, the degree is different, but the principle holds. Nick Dunn, the chief financial officer of Gatwick airport, says: \u201cOur overall charges reflect the money we make in retail and parking: inherently, there is already discount or cross-subsidy there for airlines.\u201d Gatwick signed its own growth deal with its major customer, easyJet, with \u201cquite an incentive\u201d to bring in more passengers, particularly in the off-season. Ryanair only flies around 1 million of the airport\u2019s 43 million passengers a year, meaning Gatwick\u2019s focus can be on higher levels of service demanded by other airlines, with correspondingly higher charges (nearer \u00a39). Free won\u2019t happen here, O\u2019Leary admits: but where Ryanair can bring its clout, and where airports are desperate for growth, zero hour beckons. Aviation consultant John Strickland says: \u201cRyanair already negotiate the lowest charges, so if they want to share the retail pie then airports will be reluctant: they already use that income to subsidise charges. But if airlines can grow that pie, that would be a very attractive proposition. It would have to go beyond the airline-airport dynamic as it is today: they would have to jointly sell something new, by convincing airline customers to buy at the airport.\u201d To what extent Ryanair needs this is debatable. Its bargain fares have always been supplemented with expensive add-ons, from bags to booking fees, and \u201cfree\u201d fares are unlikely to be different, even if Ryanair has moderated its more punitive charges. Pre-booked bags still generate an undisclosed but sizeable chunk of the \u20ac3.2bn fare revenue Ryanair took in the first half of this year; ancillary revenues \u2013 from car hire to seat selection and onboard food \u2013 made almost \u20ac1bn more. But even those streams may soon look traditional. Already, says Strickland, \u201cmore than 20% of their revenues don\u2019t come from tickets anyway, but things we buy onboard or via their website. Their ambition is to be more like an Amazon.\u201d At Ryanair, the mantra is \u201cload factor active, yield passive\u201d \u2013 or fill the planes, whatever the fare. And more planes need to be filled, with a fleet growing to double passenger numbers to over 200m in a decade. That scale alone, says O\u2019Leary, means fares will fall. But that is just the start. Sales won\u2019t be just inflight or at the airport, or even the holiday \u2013 but capturing the customer for everyday transactions via My Ryanair, the registration database, for all manner of promotions. Alas, for most summer holidays, fares will remain far from free. But for the flexible, minimalist traveller to less fashionable airports, free fares could really mean free \u2013 and sooner rather than later if Britain does ever cut air passenger duty (APD), as airlines beg. \u201cIf I start getting that back, why not? I\u2019m doing seat sales this week at \u00a34 and I\u2019m paying the \u00a313 APD,\u201d growls O\u2019Leary. \u201cI\u2019m paying you to fly with me.\u201d Costly extras Baggage Often an inescapable add-on for families and leisure travellers, although O\u2019Leary (again) claims to have done the world a service by weaning flyers off their luggage habit. Checked-in bags booked online will typically cost \u00a315-\u00a350 on Ryanair, rising to \u00a360 per bag at the airport. A 20kg bag will cost \u00a313-\u00a330 on easyJet. British Airways\u2019 fares normally include one checked-in suitcase of up to 23kg, although it has muddied the waters by offering \u201chand-baggage only\u201d fares in recent years. The hand-luggage allowance can also be a trap for the unwary: a heavy, small suitcase is fine on BA or easyJet, but it needs to weigh less than 10kg on Ryanair or Monarch. On Wizz, a small case as hand baggage still incurs a charge. Seating On easyJet, it costs from \u00a31.99 simply to choose, rising to \u00a319.99 to pick the best seats. Ryanair charges \u00a315 for the best seats (\u00a322.50 if done at airport check-in) but picking any seat yourself will cost \u00a38. With BA\u2019s lowest-priced tickets, choosing seats costs an extra \u00a37. Priority boarding This is wrapped in with choosing a premium seat on easyJet, but you can still pay another \u00a35 for the privilege at Ryanair. Payment Using a credit rather than debit card means a 2% charge on Ryanair, 1% on easyJet. BA charges \u00a35 per ticket (not per booking) but will move to a 1% fee next month.",

The move comes as Europe\u2019s airports, rail freight terminals, and shipping container ports are deluged by record numbers of parcels ordered by Christmas shoppers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The boom in overseas firms selling goods to Europe has been accompanied by an explosion in VAT fraud. In total, the European commission estimates \u20ac5bn a year is now lost in tax revenues \u2013 a figure that is rising annually at 15-20%. Many import firms are illegally underdeclaring the value of goods as they arrive in the EU, knowing that customs officers are overwhelmed and unable to make proper checks. A study published in May by Copenhagen Economics estimated that more than 60% of goods arriving into the EU with some postal carriers were failing to comply with VAT declaration rules. As well as fraudulent underdeclarations, some importers are able to legitimately avoid VAT if their goods are of low value (\u00a315 or less in the UK). There are about 150m such parcels arriving in Europe each year, all of them purporting to qualify for this low-value VAT exemption.

                "bodyText":"Behind the showbiz hullaballoo of ITV\u2019s annual showcase for advertisers at the London Palladium, the company\u2019s chief executive, Adam Crozier, is facing his stiffest test since successfully leading the broadcaster out of the previous recession after taking the helm in 2010. The red carpet event last Thursday came as Brexit jitters left ITV facing its worst run-up to Christmas for advertising revenue since 2008. Crozier has spent the six years since the most recent major advertising recession investing more than \u00a31bn in building an international TV production powerhouse to steel the broadcaster against just such a downturn. However, investors are starting to question whether ITV Studios \u2013 which makes and sells shows including Victoria, Mr Selfridge, Come Dine with Me and Coronation Street \u2013 is starting to lose its glitter. Investors took fright when ITV Studios reported a 9% fall in organic revenues, which excludes the revenue from recent acquisitions such as The Voice maker Talpa Media, and Poldark and Parade\u2019s End maker Mammoth, for the first nine months of the year. This followed a 34% decline in revenues at its US production operation in the first half of the year. The US has been Crozier\u2019s main market for international expansion, with hundreds of millions of pounds spent buying the makers of shows including Duck Dynasty, Pawn Stars and Cake Boss. ITV prompted further concern by saying profit growth at ITV Studios, which has increased from \u00a391m in 2009 to an expected \u00a3250m this year, will flatline in 2017. ITV, which took the unusual step of organising a call with analysts to reassure investors, brushed off concerns by blaming factors including the \u201clumpy\u201d nature of broadcasters\u2019 timing of when to air shows. For example, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, ITV\u2019s biggest global franchise judged by the number of countries to which it has been sold, is not airing this year, but has two series scheduled in 2017. Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg, said of ITV\u2019s need to organise a special call: \u201cIt is a bit of a giveaway [that there really is an issue] if you feel it needs to be discussed. The pitch about [expanding] ITV Studios in the beginning was that there is structural growth, a demand for high-quality content, and that it is not cyclical like advertising. People who thought this was a steady growth business need to revise expectations and expect volatility.\u201d Crozier has spent \u00a31.2bn acquiring 15 production companies, a figure that could rise to nearly \u00a32bn by 2021 if the former owners reach their earn-out targets, triggering further payments. Crozier said ITV Studios had experienced a blip, and new and returning dramas would help fuel a return to organic revenue growth next year. \u201cWe remain very confident in the outlook for ITV Studios,\u201d he told analysts earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really good, strong pipeline of new and returning dramas.\u201d He told investors that profit would be flat in 2017 as ITV Studios focused on major investment in finding new hit shows. \u201cWe do think it is the right thing to do to invest in our studios business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would be doing the right thing for the business if we didn\u2019t continue to invest in that long-term success. That\u2019s absolutely the right thing for us to do.\u201d Investment in ITV Studios has been the most successful part of Crozier\u2019s three-pronged diversification plan. Online and pay revenues, such as through video advertising and Sky pay-TV channel Encore, have more than doubled to \u00a3188m in the past five years, but still account for only 6% of ITV\u2019s \u00a33bn-plus total revenues. A senior executive at a rival TV company said the ITV Studios strategy may have peaked and its foray into the US market had not yet worked out. Despite the huge investment in the US, at least 80% of ITV\u2019s total revenues come from the UK, and up to 70% of these are from advertising. \u201cThe general view is that it has been a great short-term strategy,\u201d the executive said. \u201cThey wanted a transformational story and to say they increased profits. No doubt it worked and drove share price. The problem is they seem to have overpaid for some assets in the UK, and especially the US.\u201d A wider issue facing ITV, and all traditional broadcasters, is the rise of the deep-pocketed digital upstarts. Netflix, which has a $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) TV and film content budget next year, is investing heavily in shows such as royal drama The Crown, its first UK production, which cost an average of more than \u00a35m per episode. Amazon\u2019s signing of the former Top Gear presenters to make three series of the recently launched The Grand Tour has a reported \u00a3160m price tag. The more budget-conscious ITV, which spends about \u00a31bn per year on programming, spends closer to \u00a31m an episode for a select few top-flight dramas, such as Victoria. ITV\u2019s share price has climbed from 55p when Crozier was appointed in January 2010 to 280p in 2015. However, ITV has wobbled in the past year and, exacerbated by the economic fallout from the EU referendum, the broadcaster\u2019s share price has fallen by one-third to less than 170p. In September, Crozier sold \u00a31m of shares at \u00a32 apiece, a move investors took a dim view of, sending shares tumbling. Alex DeGroote, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cDirectors selling is very rarely viewed as a positive, because nobody knows the company\u2019s prospects better than executive management.\u201d DeGroote questioned whether the ITV Studios stumble, and the uncertain economic environment and fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, could derail Crozier\u2019s plan and make the broadcaster a takeover target. \u201cThis was a very sure-footed management team that has executed seamlessly on the recovery story since 2009,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Brexit has changed the rules of engagement.
