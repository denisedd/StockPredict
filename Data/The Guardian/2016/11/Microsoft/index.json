Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright.<br></p> <p>Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president.</p> <p>Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c27e4b029b92ca464fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:23:59.316Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher.

                "bodyText":"DING DING! Wall Street has just posted its best day since the start of March, as the closing bell brings today\u2019s rally to a halt. Predictions of a Hillary Clinton election victory have cheered the markets, ending a nine-day losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 371 points, or 2.08%, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 2.1%. The tech stock-heavy Nasdaq index gained almost 2.5%, as investors piled back into shares. This followed a strong rally in Europe, where London\u2019s FTSE 100 posted a triple-digit gain. Chris Beauchamp of IG says we\u2019ve seen a buying stampede today: According to the IG binary market, IG clients think Hillary remains the favourite, with her chances of election holding at 81%.* US assets have been heavily bid throughout the day, as the nine-day selloff is banished to distant memory. With around 36 hours to go until the result becomes known, there is plenty of potential for upsets however, and we may see the bullish move falter tomorrow if the battleground states remain in close contention. As we\u2019ve been covering in this blog since early morning, the FBI\u2019s decision to clear Hillary Clinton over her email server has given the Democratic candidate a last-minute lift. But.... this race is not over, even if some investors are acting like Clinton is home and dry. Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania will determine who wins the White House. And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here\u2019s a flavour of our latest news story: The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination battles began \u2013 in the rustbelt \u2013 as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the country\u2019s deep economic divide. Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright. Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen.... Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u2019ll be back in the morning with more market action. Goodnight! GW The Dow Jones industrial average is pushing even higher in the final few minutes of trading, and is now up 2%..... I knew there was something important coming up. Thanks, AP! Shares in shipping, logistics and transport companies are having a particularly good day, sending the Dow Jones Transportation Average up by 2.8% in late trading. The index has gained 19% since January, which is significant as it\u2019s often seen as a bellwether for the wider economy (companies don\u2019t ship as much if they\u2019re losing business). Analysts reckon that the transport sector would do well under a Clinton or Trump presidency, as both have promised spending on infrastructure. Marketwatch has more details. The British pound continues to be buffeted by the sudden strength of the US dollar today. Sterling has shed one cent, or 0.9%, today and is currently hovering around $1.24. The dollar is up around 0.75% against a basket of currencies today, including the euro and the yen. That\u2019s (yet) another sign that investors are pricing in a Clinton victory. Constellation Brands, which imports beers such as Mexico\u2019s Corona, has joined the Mexican Peso as a surprise proxy for Trump success. Shares in Constellation have jumped by 4% today, having fallen pretty steadily through November. Trump\u2019s anti-Mexico rhetoric has worried many US firms who import from Mexico, as he has pledged to shake up trade links between the two countries. With less than 90 minutes to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still on a tear and on track for its best day\u2019s trading since March. Signs that Hillary Clinton has a better chance of winning tomorrow\u2019s election are driving share higher, despite many polls suggesting she only has a narrow lead over Donald Trump. Here\u2019s the situation on the trading floors: Dow Jones: up 335 points or 1.8% at 18,223 S&amp;P 500: Up 43 points or 2% at 2,128 Nasdaq: Up 111 points or 2.4% at 4,771 With Clinton seen as the more status quo option, investors are aware that the markets could tumble if Donald Trump stages a surprise victory. Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, says (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t see another 5 percent bump on a Clinton win, but I could see a 5 to 7 percent pullback on a Trump win.\u201d The gold price is continuing to slide today, as traders put their money into riskier assets. Bullion is down 1.8% right now at $1,280 per ounce, down from $1,304 on Friday night. Our colleagues in America are relentlessly live-blogging the final day of the campaign. They\u2019ve already covered of a speech by president Barack Obama, fears of voter suppression in North Carolina, and analysis of how often each candidate has fibbed during the campaign race.... Today\u2019s stock market rally has added tens of billions of dollars to the wealth of the world\u2019s richest people. Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks those with more money then they could possibly know what to do with, has jumped by 0.9% today to $4.4 trillion, a gain of $37bn. Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, gained $2.7bn, while Mexico\u2019s richesst man, Carlos Slim, gained a far from slimline $2.2nbn. Well done chaps. And now we know who\u2019ll suffer if the markets have a meltdown on Wednesday..... Stock markets could plunge by over 5% on Wednesday if Trump beats Clinton, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u2019s Derek Halpenny. He was speaking to Sky News a few minutes ago: The S&amp;P 500 index has jumped by 2% today, which puts it on track for its best one-day performance since March this year. That would also reverse nine-days of losses, which accelerated after FBI chief James Comey sensationally revealed that the agency was investigating a new set of emails related to Hillary Clinton. The oil price has also risen today, with the price of a barrel of New York light crude gaining 0.6% to $44.34. The rally is partly due to Hillary Clinton\u2019s improved prospects in the election, now that the FBI have cleared her of criminal wrongdoing over those emails. Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, summed up the mood: \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit less of a concern about the economy falling apart.\u201d And here\u2019s a reminder of why financial investors worldwide are wary of Trump: Each of the 30 shares on the Dow Jones index has risen so far today, as investors pour money back into stocks. United Healthcare is leading the rally, up 3.2%, followed by tech firms Microsoft and Intel, and banking giants JP Morgan and Goldman. Supermarket titan WalMart is bringing up the rear, with a 0.4% gain. And this has sent the Dow up by a chunky 350 points, or 1.96%. Although some pollsters say the election looks tight, New York traders are calculating that Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of victory have risen since the FBI cleared her over her email server last night. And Clinton continues to be seen as a more attractive candidate by Wall Street than Donald Trump, given (among other things) his opposition to trade deals. Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, explains (via Reuters) \u201cClinton is a known quantity and investors hate uncertainty and they are very happy even if taxes were to go up ... In the case of Trump, it is uncertain as to what he stands for.\u201d Volatility on Wall Street has fallen to its lowest level since the Brexit vote, in another sign that investors are more relaxed about the election. One letter was all it took to send stock markets sharply higher. The news that FBI director James Comey had written to Congress to say Hillary Clinton had no case to answer over the latest batch of contentious emails boosted her chances against Donald Trump and sent investors scrabbling to buy shares. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 113.64 points or 1.7% higher at 6806.90, its biggest one day rise since 2 September Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.93% to 10,456.95 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.91% higher at 4461.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.56% to 16,736.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.45% at 8918.8 In Athens, the Greek market added 1.16% to 580.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 344 points or 1.93%. Whoever wins the US election, the initial market reaction may not last long, according to Capital Economics\u2019 Simon MacAdam. He said: In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long. Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen. The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings. As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries. And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said: There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president. Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000. Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday has proceeded in a way eerily similar to the scenes before the Brexit back in June. In the run-up to the referendum the markets saw a last minute surge as investors prepared to Britain to remain in the EU, only to suffer a shock when the votes were counted. The market has a bit more time to steady itself before the results of the election are announced; as the US electorate head to the polls tomorrow it will be interesting to see whether investors opt for continued Clinton confidence, sensible stability, or a sharp turn Trump-wards. And here, courtesy of Nomura, is a look at how the last four US elections played out (timings Eastern time): Former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan - he of \u201cirrational exhuberence\u201d - is critical of both candidates in terms of their economic acumen: Here are the biggest risers on Wall Street so far: As expected, US markets are moving ahead now Hillary Clinton has been cleared by the FBI over her emails, improving her prospects a day before the election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 250 points while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.6%. If you want to follow the last day of campaigning in the presidential election, our US blog has the coverage: Just under half an hour until Wall Street opens, and the futures are predicting a sharp rise following the latest election news: And here\u2019s a guide to which states report when: Memories of June\u2019s EU referendum are still quite raw in the City of London. Investors vividly remember seeing the pound suffer an almighty slump on June 24th this year, falling from $1.50 to $1.36 in a single panic-driven session. Could Trump vs Clinton offer a repeat performance? Not if the polls are right...but don\u2019t forget that the Remain campaign held a clear lead as Brits cast their votes. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: There is always an element of Deja Vue effect, which we had during Brexit. Right now, the base case for markets is that Clinton will win the election. This is the biggest worry for us and the possibility of surprise should not be undermined. Donald Trump\u2019s victory will not only bring the knee jerk reaction for the market, but we are also concerned about the geopolitical uncertainty. So far looking at the Mexican peso, it is very clear that traders are respecting the reliability of the US polls. The US polling has a much better track record predicting that who is in the lead and who will be in the Oval Office. There is huge money involved in this process and they pay attention to every grain in reflecting the results. Bloomberg have also knocked up a cheat sheet showing how a Trump win would be bad for shares and the US dollar, but good for gold. Analysts at Dutch bank ING say the US dollar will rally against the euro and the yen if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, while the Mexican Peso would also surge. But it\u2019s the opposite story if Trump triumphs - although in both cases it also depends what happens on Capitol Hill. Here\u2019s ING\u2019s cheat sheet: They\u2019ve also produced this map, showing how Pennsylvania and Florida could be the key to the contest. If Trump loses one, he needs the other plus four more key swing states: Investors betting on a Clinton victory should remember the 24th June, when the Leave campaign defied the pollsters and won Britain\u2019s EU referendum It could happen again this week, warns Luke Hickmore, senior fixed income fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management: \u201cMarkets are edging towards Clinton largely because of polling and we saw in the Brexit referendum how wrong that can be. The memory of that referendum should loom large in investors\u2019 memories because so much of the polling was wrong then.\u201d (quote via Reuters) OK, it\u2019s breakfast time in America (on the easterly side of the country, anyway) so let\u2019s quickly recap. Stock markets have rallied strongly this morning after Hillary Clinton received a late boost in her bid to become US president. Shares have jumped in Asia and Europe, following the news that the FBI have found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing over her private email server. Investors are calculating that FBI James Comey\u2019s announcement raises the chances that Clinton beats Donald Trump to the White House. So they\u2019re putting money into shares, and taking it out of safe assets such as gold and the Japanese yen. Here\u2019s the situation: FTSE 100: Up 96 points or 1.4% at 6789 German DAX: Up 170 points or 1.6% at 10429 French CAC: Up 76 points or 1.75% at 4454 Wall Street traders are expected to send share prices romping higher when trading begins in a couple of hours. This follows nine days of consecutive losses, as election uncertainty has bitten. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called up 229 points, or over 1.2%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Looking ahead to the US open and it seems that there is going to be a rare example of the Dow Jones and dollar both heading in the same direction this afternoon. With the greenback already on a tear the Dow is expected to rise more than 200 points after the bell, putting it back above the 18000 it fell below last week. The US dollar is enjoying a strong rally, and is up one cent against the British pound at $1.242. But the Mexican peso is doing even better; which also suggests traders are cutting the chances of a surprise Trump victory. New polls have given Clinton the edge in the national polls, with Bloomberg giving her a three-point lead. But key battleground stakes such as Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida will determine the battle. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City trading firm IG, says European stock markets are \u201cin a buoyant mood\u201d following the FBI announcement. The big question is whether this announcement will have a material effect upon the outcome of the US election, which is clearly perceived to be the case according to today\u2019s market reaction. But investors are also nervous, especially given the recent Brexit shock: With the IG binary now showing an 83.5% chance of a Clinton victory (up from Friday\u2019s 74%), it is clear that traders expect this announcement to have a substantial impact upon the election result. However, if the EU referendum taught us anything, it is to not be complacent when there is a vote against a campaign which appeals to the disaffected and marginalised section of a population. Here\u2019s another poll, giving Hillary Clinton the edge: This is helping to keep stock markets buoyant today....and possibly setting investors up for a big fall on Wednesday, if the polls are wrong. Investors (and concerned citizens) across Europe need to decide whether to pull an all-nighter to follow the US election, or get up extra-early to see the result. Based on the last four elections... we can say that the results could be in by 5am GMT (or midnight in New York), if it\u2019s a decisive win for either candidate. In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama has given his victory address before the London stock markets had opened. But in 2004, we didn\u2019t get the result until around lunchtime in New York, when the City of London was winding down for the day. And the 2000 race between George W Bush and Al Gore wasn\u2019t decided for a month - following legal challenges over the result in Florida. Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura say: Hopefully by 4am to 5am (GMT) on Wednesday we\u2019ll have a good idea, but if it\u2019s close\u2026it could be another 12 hours (or more) from then. They\u2019ve created some handy graphics to show how the last four races ended, and how this year\u2019s could play out: Just in: Clinton holds a three point lead over Trump, according to a Bloomberg poll conducted between Friday and Sunday. There are two scenarios in which the US election could spark a stock market rout, says Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser of investment giant Allianz. The first, unsurprisingly enough, is that Donald Trump becomes US president, sending share prices sliding as investors fear for the future. El-Erian explain why, in an article for Bloomberg. An equity market selloff is likely should Donald Trump win the presidential vote and also reaffirm his intention to move quickly on policy positions that disrupt long-standing trade relationships (such as tariffs on China and Mexico and the revocation of the North American Free Trade Agreement). The selloff would be larger if he also were to also create uncertainty about the future shape of the financial system, such as by calling for an immediate repeal of the Dodd-Frank legislation without offering a credible alternative. The second scenario is that Hillary Clinton wins the White House, and the Democratic party takes control of Congress. That would clear the way for reforms to clean up the energy sector, and price controls on biotech companies, along with higher government borrowing to boost growth. The other tail event, a Clinton win combined with a Democratic sweep of Congress, would likely bring about an equity market selloff that would entail more pronounced moves for certain sectors (such as pharmaceuticals and traditional energy). Bond markets would also come under pressure because of the higher probability of fiscal stimulus. World First\u2019s chief economist, Jeremy Cook, has taken a stab at how tomorrow\u2019s election may play out: Every European stock market has jumped by at least 1% today, led by Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB index, setting the scene for a Wall Street rally: Today\u2019s stock market rally shows that Hillary Clinton deserves her reputation as Wall Street\u2019s favoured candidate, says Yann Quelenn, market analyst at online bank Swissquote. He writes: This morning, the US elections is definitely the financial markets\u2019 barometer. Futures on the S&amp;P are up 1.3% at the moment and we should see a good day on stocks. This relief rally is definitely proving the fact that markets are clearly supporting Hillary, justifying her \u201cCandidate of Wall Street\u201d moniker. Consequently, a Clinton win would spark a significant relief rally in overly-bearish positioned markets. Queleen also reminds us that the US stock market just racked up a nine-day losing streak, for the first time in 36 years, as panicky investors fled the trading floors. The US dollar\u2019s resurgence has brought the British pound back to earth with a bump, and back below $1.24. Sterling rallied strongly last week, on hopes that the UK government might negotiate a \u2018softer\u2019 Brexit. It got a real lift on Thursday, after the high court ruled that prime minister Theresa May can\u2019t trigger the exit process without parliament\u2019s approval. But the dollar now has the upper hand, following the FBI\u2019s decision. And that shows the US election is a more immediate concern than Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Sterling\u2019s weakness continues to push shares higher in London, as it means international-focused firms who earn money in US dollars will benefit. Since June, we\u2019ve seen a clear pattern that the FTSE rises when the pound fall, and vice versa, as Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: Driving the FTSE 100 higher today are the big foreign-earners like drug companies, miners, oil producers and HSBC \u2013 the bank makes up over 5% of the FTSE 100 by index weight so today\u2019s 4% rise is helping the blue chip index in no small way. Back in the UK, the Halifax bank has reported that British house prices jumped by 1.4% last month. That\u2019s much stronger than expected, and something of a surprise as rival lender Nationwide has already decided that prices were flat in October. It may mean that households aren\u2019t too worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU, says Rob Weaver of property crowdfunding platform Property Partner. The market suffered an initial wobble post-Brexit but is proving resilient, mostly the result of the severe supply shortage that\u2019s helping to prop up prices. And here\u2019s a chart showing how the Mexican peso rallied hard overnight, as the FBI\u2019s announcement hit the wires: Here\u2019s confirmation that the US stock market is on track for a pre-vote bounce: Gold is getting a hammering this morning, as fears of a Trump presidency recede. The gold price has dropped by 1.4% to $1.286 per ounce, ending its recent rally. Gold had benefitted from anxiety over the US election, with investors looking for somewhere safe to put their money. You can almost hear the sigh of relief from the City, as fears over the US election subside. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Election fears be damned! The European markets roared into life this Monday following a bit of good news for the Clinton campaign.... The thinking will be that this news may well swing any undecided voters back towards Clinton, therefore lifting her already substantial chances of winning Tuesday\u2019s election. However, regular readers may remember that the stock markets also rallied on June 23rd, on predictions that the Remain campaign would win the UK\u2019s EU referendum. It didn\u2019t quite turn out like that, as Campbell reminds us: Given that Trump-fears were what dragged the market down at the end of last week it is understandable that the markets have seen such explosive gains after the bell \u2013 though, it must be noted, there were similar scenes before the Brexit back in June. Financial analysts say that the markets are betting on a Hillary Clinton win this morning, after the FBI gave the \u2018all-clear\u2019 last night. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday\u2019s statement from the FBI that there was nothing new in the latest batch of Clinton emails, has swung market sentiment back towards a Clinton win and risk is \u201con\u201d. Whether voters see it that way, we\u201dll see soon enough. Gold, yen are down; yields, equities, oil and the dollar are up. Sean Callow, a senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney, says today\u2019s market rally shows that investors are worried about a Trump victory: \u201cA Clinton win would clear the decks for the Fed to raise rates in December and for markets to price in a more aggressive profile for tightening over 2017\u201d \u201cThe surge in U.S. equity futures and slide in the gold price reinforces the evidence that a Trump win is seen as negative for global growth and profits.\u201d But Rachel Cunliffe, deputy editor of news website Reaction, points out that Clinton may still be damaged: Wall Street is expected to join the rally when trading begins in around six hours time. The futures market is predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average will gain 230 points, or 1.2%. Banks and natural resource stocks are leading the rally in London, driven by bets that Hillary Clinton is on track for victory. Mining giants BHP Billiton, Antifagasta, Rio Tinto and Glencore are all among the risers, along with HSBC (which posted financial results this morning). They\u2019re driving the FTSE 100 up sharply in early trading, with only a handful of stocks struggling. Henry Croft of Accendo Markets says the rally is triggered by Hillary Clinton getting the all clear from the FBI for a second time. Polls are indicating Clinton pulling away slightly, although her lead remains well below the levels pre-FBI investigation. The election will be the driving force for markets before Wednesday morning. Of course, the internationally-focused FTSE 100 index also benefits from the weak pound (which has shed a whole cent this morning to $1.241). Ding Ding! European stock markets are rallying, as traders react to the overnight news from America. In the City, the FTSE 100 blue-chip index has jumped by 100 points, or 1.5%. There are similar gains in Paris and Frankfurt, as money pours into riskier assets - and out of save havens like gold and the Japanese yen. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the FBI\u2019s decision to clear Clinton (again) could be a \u2018game changer\u2019 in the race for the White House. But investors will wonder how much damage has already been done, in the nine days after James Comey announced that a new set of emails were being examined. Brooks says: The Clinton camp will be hoping that the reopening of the FBI investigation, which turned out to be for nothing, put off not too many early voters. Ultimately it all rests on the Electoral College votes, and in this area Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead looks solid, but not as insurmountable as it once did. She is predicted to win 216 votes, vs. 164 for Trump. However, we expect her lead to widen once more, if the latest FBI announcement translates into more Electoral College votes on Monday, as we expect. She adds that traders won\u2019t be counting Donald Trump out of the race, though: You can\u2019t rule out Trump, and the risk of shy Trump voters disrupting polling expectations in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio remains a known unknown in this election race. For markets this is ultimately the key concern \u2013 traders don\u2019t have any special insight into this outcome of this election and this may limit market cheer at the start of this week on the back of Clinton\u2019s email scandal being put to bed (again.) Traders may prefer to sit on the sidelines until the actual result is called The US dollar is on a tear this morning, following after the FBI confirmed that it won\u2019t bring charges against Hillary Clinton over emails related to her personal email server. The greenback has gained 0.7% against the euro, and almost 0.9% against the pound, in a broad-based rally against other leading currencies. But the Mexican peso is actually gaining ground against the dollar. It rises whenever Donald Trump\u2019s victory chances fall, given the Republican nominee\u2019s plans to build a large wall on the US border. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. After a particularly lengthy and bloody battle, the US presidential race is heading into its final hours. In 48 hours time, we\u2019ll probably know whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have claimed the White House. And shares are rallying across the world after Clinton got a late boost -- with FBI director James Comey announcing that he will not bring charges against the Democratic candidate after examining a new set of emails. Comey told Congress last night: \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u201d Clinton\u2019s camp has welcomed the news that Comey has confirmed his initial decision back in July (although they must still be irked that the FBI chief shook up the campaign nine days ago by announcing that the emails were being probed). Trump reacted in a fairly predictable manner - crying foul and claiming that the FBI couldn\u2019t actually review 650,000 emails in eight days. Either way, Comey\u2019s announcement has sparked a wave of buying, as investors around the globe calculated that Clinton\u2019s chances of success have risen. Shares have jumped in Asia, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 1.6%. And European and US markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 tipped to jump by 1%. The US dollar is also gaining. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: The US dollar has rebounded and equity markets look likely to follow suit this morning, after both fell heavily last week on fears about the unknown quantity a Trump win would mean. As the more status quo candidate, Clinton is definitely the markets\u2019 preferred winner; she\u2019s less likely to provoke a global trade war or destabilise the geopolitical order by pulling back from Nato (Trump has suggested members of the alliance should pay for America\u2019s protection). Trump\u2019s attacks on America\u2019s top central banker, Janet Yellen, have also alarmed investors. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The question which traders are concerned about is whether a Trump\u2019s victory can really topple the investor confidence in the market? Well, that depends on if he will be a typical politician or not. If he sticks to his words and fires Janet Yellen from her job, the market is going to see that as a massive event of uncertainty.... Also, if he increases the trade tariffs, it will impact the growth in China and Mexico (this is where he has the strongest view). The spill over effects will not only be limited to emerging markets, but also in the developed markets as well. Also coming up today.... Although the US election is the main event, the City will also get some new economic data to digest 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price index, showing how the UK property market performed in October 9.30am: Sentix\u2019s survey of eurozone investor confidence for November 10am: Eurozone retail sales for September We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. </p> <p>No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.</p> <p>At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5824895ee4b0c71347c4a963\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T15:00:29.294Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Analyst: Republican unity driving markets up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a462d5b6cbbc2240fcceb48ddbb1bd2192fe4008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a462d5b6cbbc2240fcceb48ddbb1bd2192fe4008/0_0_3500_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders On The Floor Of The NYSE.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election.

Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified.<br></li> <li><strong>The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory.</strong> There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll.

Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure.</p> <p>To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d.</p> <p>Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks use<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/laffer-curve-napkin-doodle-launched-supply-side-economics\">back of the napkin logic</a> to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t).</p> </blockquote> <p>But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots more here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/796698770138419201\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Political Economy &amp;

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points. It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from infrastructure sending). But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or protectionist trade police would hurt them. Bloomberg has a neat summary: Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.\u2019s 4.3 percent rally. Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent. Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of higher inflation and extra US government borrowing. The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump and Barack Obama have their first meeting since the election. It\u2019s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious. Our US politics liveblog has full details. Here\u2019s a flavour: Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u201cIf he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u201d Obama said. Trump said he had \u201crespect for the president\u201d and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u201cvery fine man.\u201d And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close. I\u2019m taking a break now, but we\u2019ll be back with the Wall Street close... Capital Economics says investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump\u2019s plans: There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic policies of the incoming Republican administration. However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on track to hit a record close. Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the rally, on predictions that they\u2019ll benefit from Trumponomics. But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they\u2019ll suffer under the next presidency. Here\u2019s the story of how the Dow defied forecasts and spiked after Trump\u2019s victory: A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, triggering a late selloff in London. Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as investors come to terms with Trump\u2019s success. A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the value of international companies who earn money abroad. So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, finished 0.4% higher though. It\u2019s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates) Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America will need a lot more metal to implement Trump\u2019s new infrastructure plan. But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, some by over 5%. The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with Donald Trump, and isn\u2019t prejudging him. Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to speculate\u201d about whether Trump would hurt the global economy. Rice added: \u201cWe need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we\u2019ll be making an assessment at that time.\u201d European stock markets are heading lower in late trading, as Trump-inspired volatility grips the City again. The S&amp;P tech stock index has shed 3%, and is on track for its worst day since the Brexit vote (via Reuters). Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president. Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too. Trump\u2019s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news for the tech sector. He\u2019s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign. Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn\u2019t crashed since Donald Trump pulled off one of the most surprising election results of the age. But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider consequences of America\u2019s choice -- as the protests in New York, Chicago, Boston etc overnight show. Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the world watches him closely. The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve. Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy: The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates. And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says: This is about the kind of country that America wants to be. At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election. And most analysts were wrong. There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied since Trump won the presidential race, says Jim Cielinski of Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Trump \u201cthe President\u201d will not be the same thing as Trump \u201cthe candidate\u201d. Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified. The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward. Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions. For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward. Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%. They\u2019re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are boosted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, as she\u2019d promised to end price-gouging. And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild American infrastructure. Caterpillar is up 2%. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as the Trump bump reached New York. Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to yesterday\u2019s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if Republicans won the race for the White House. The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709. And the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too: Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog. Indeed, there\u2019s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be: Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen\u2019s position at the Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months. Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation! The Financial Times has coined this term, to explain the big selloff in bond prices today. The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new president drives up economic growth, inflation, and inflation expectations, with a debt-financed stimulus programme. Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says: \u201cUnder a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that drives growth and markets are reflecting that. \u201cThere was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr Trump\u2019s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is steepening.\u201d And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause a bond crash. Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth. He\u2019s been speaking on CNBC: Greenspan also backed Donald Trump over one issue - the regulation of America\u2019s banking sector - saying: \u201cI\u2019d love to see Dodd-Frank disappear. Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now. The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies will drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster profit growth consequently boosting inflation. So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation. Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their national debts. The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night. The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06% The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17% Longer-dated debt is also weakening: We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their quantitative easing schemes. So a return to normal levels wouldn\u2019t be a disaster. Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently. And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European markets are lower as this morning\u2019s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out. Investors may be taking a big risk by deciding that Donald Trump will become a new man once he crosses the seal in the Oval Office carpet. The \u2018Trump bump\u2019 has been based on a somewhat breezy assumption that the new president will successfully implement the debt-fuelled infrastructure programme that many experts support, while ignoring the chance that we actually enter an era of painful protectionism and trade wars. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group in London, has just published a \u2018must-read\u2019 blog piece, analysing the impact of Trump. Here\u2019s a flavour: The markets seem to have decided that [aggressive deficit-financed state spending] will indeed now happen \u2014 stocks up, commodities up, bonds down. Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure. To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d. Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks useback of the napkin logic to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t). But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says: Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness. And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve. There\u2019s lots more here: Hello.... the rally in European stocks is petering out. The FTSE 100 has now shed its early gains and is now down 6 points, having been up 50 points at the start. Not clear what\u2019s prompted this... Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, is cautiously hopeful that the infrastructure plan proposed by Donald Trump could help the US economy. He just told Bloomberg TV that he \u201cwelcomes and applauds\u201d Trump\u2019s pledge to renew America\u2019s highways, bridges, airports schools and hospitals. It could boost job creation in the short tun, and expand the US economy\u2019s capacity for growth in the medium term, believes Summers - who has often called for more fiscal spending to fight \u2018secular stagnation\u2019. But Summers also sounds deeply concerned, saying Trump needs to propose \u201cserious and concrete plans\u201d to address America\u2019s economic concerns, and surround himself with responsible people with \u201cconsiderable experience\u201d. He says calling China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d is unwise, while repealing the NAFTA trade deal would do enormous economic damage. And Summers, who served under Bill Clinton, suggets Trump cannot be as divisive in government as he was in the campaign. Unless there is a clear sense that all Americans are welcomed and part of his vision of a prosperous America, and all nations are part of his vision o f a prosperous world, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be successful in creating the world we all want to see, Summers concludes. Demand for gold hit a record high yesterday, which tells you a couple of things. 1) There was a massive flight to safe-haven assets as the shock election result rocked Asian and European markets. 2) People are buying gold as a hedge against inflation (the price has risen by 0.3% today). Over in America, Donald Trump is preparing to visit the White House to meet president Obama, following a night of protests against his election victory. Our main liveblog is covering all the details: Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says Donald Trump needs to flesh out his economics plans, fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mann says Trump needs to set out policies to identify sources of growth in the US economy, and make sure the benefits are shared fairly between the American people. That\u2019s what got him to the White House , the fact that the gains aren\u2019t widely shared. The deputy leader of Germany\u2019s governing CDU party, Michael Fuchs, hopes that president Trump will be more responsible than nominee Trump: The copper prices has hit its highest level since July 2015, up 5% today, thanks to Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure. And shares in two mining companies, Antofagasta and Vedanta, have both soared by 14% as investors anticipate a new fiscal boost next year. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says copper is the \u2018big winner\u2019 from Trump\u2019s victory (which won\u2019t be much comfort to those on the losing side). He adds: President elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to spend more than $500 billion on rebuilding America\u2019sroads, bridges and airports helped send construction and steel stocks sharply higher following his surprise election win. Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta Resources, also anticipates a boost. He says (via Blooomberg): All that we see for President-elect Trump is that he will focus on building, he will focus on the infrastructure. \u201cThat is what the market is reacting to.\u201d Trump\u2019s victory is also driving up the shares of military and defence companies. BAE Systems have jumped by 6% this morning, adding to yesterday\u2019s spike following the election result. It\u2019s a sign that the City expect Trump to deliver on his promise to boost spending on the US military (which he claimed had become depleted on president Obama\u2019s watch). BAE is one of the biggest suppliers to the US department of defence, and makes armoured vehicles, ships, fighter jets and missiles. And if Trump weakens the ties between Nato members, then European countries may feel compelled to boost their own armies. Here\u2019s confirmation that inflation expectations are rising, via analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group: Predictions that Donald Trump\u2019s policies will drive US inflation higher are causing some dramatic moves in the financial markets today. The interest rate, or yield, on Britain\u2019s 10-year government bonds just jumped over 1.31%, up from 1.23% on Wednesday night. That\u2019s the highest level since 24th June, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. Other European government bond yields are also rising. Investors are betting that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and debt-fuelled spending plans, if enacted, would be inflationary. So they\u2019re seeking a higher rate of return for holding government debt. The news overnight that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to force Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to resign has also cheered the markets. Yellen\u2019s first term expires in 2018, but there has been speculation that she might feel pressure to step down, given the attacks from Trump during the campaign. Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, has told Bloomberg TV that market confidence will improve if Yellen stays, adding: If she goes, who knows, because that depends on who comes in next. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson has been giving some more reaction to Trump\u2019s victory at a press conference in Beijing. Asked about Trump\u2019s vows to introduce a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, spokesperson Lu Kang noted that economic ties were blossoming with trade increasing from $2.5bn in 1970 to $560bn last year. \u201cEconomic cooperation between China and the US is what has made our bilateral relations stable and has propelled our bilateral relation forward,\u201d Lu said. \u201cI hope US is able to view our economic trade relationship in an objective and unbiased manner and work with us so that we can move forward. I believe that if the US keeps the country\u2019s interest and its people\u2019s interests in mind, they will make the right decision\u201d. Asked whether such protectionist measures would harm the US-China relationship the spokesperson said: \u201cI will not comment on speculation. As I said I believe that the US\u2019s leaders will make their decision based on the fundamental interests of their people. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to hit a new record high, when the US stock market opens in five hours. Last night, the Dow closed near to its highest levels, and the future market is predicting a fresh spike today. The prospect of tax reforms and a government spending boost are pushing shares up, says Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First. He says the intial Trump slump has swiftly transformed into the Trump jump: The shortening of the timeframe between decline and rebound could be down to many things but issues around full Republican control of the Presidency and the possibility that changes in tax reform, investment and regulation will come through quicker may help. Trump has also been called \u2018an inflation time-bomb\u2019 given his pledges to increase spending so we must now look at Fed policy through a new lens. Similarly, although he was elected yesterday he does not take the reins until January 20th. Well quite: Investors are hoping that taking on the presidency might provoke a change in Donald Trump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the market rally is based on: ...an reassessment of views about Trump and belief that a more Presidential individual is already replacing the highly divisive candidate character he merely portrayed in order to appeal to American frustration and win the populist vote. Markets are demonstrating an impressive ability to digest significant political change and move on, even quicker than we saw in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Given some of Trump\u2019s conduct during the election campaign (divisive comments about Muslims, Mexicans, those awful tape-recordings about women...), a transformation by Inauguration Day would be welcome. But is it realistic? Anyone who bought European shares during Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech yesterday morning has made a decent profit. The markets have now gained 4.6% since Wednesday\u2019s opening tumble: European banks are also rallying, on speculation that the next president might unravel some of the regulations brought in since the 2008 crisis. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to tear up Dodd-Frank -- the legislation brought in to protect consumers and prevent banks becoming too big to fail. Trump believes it is holding back the economy, and once told Fox News that: \u201cWe have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren\u2019t loaning to people that need it. The regulators are running the banks.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear what Trump would replace Dodd-Frank with; simply ditching the law could create the conditions that caused the credit crisis in the first place. Coper-producer Antofagasta is the top riser in London, with fellow miners Glencore and Anglo American close behind. Traders are betting that Trump\u2019s programme of cutting taxes, a new debt-funded infrastructure programme, would push up inflation and raise demand for commodities. European markets are open, and shares are rising, as predictions of a Trump slump are trampled in an early wave of buying. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 49 points, or 0.7%, to 6960 in early trading. Mining stocks and financial companies are leading the way. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB have also gained around 0.7% to 0.9%. The City analysts who predicted markets would slump if Trump pulled off a shock win have some explaining to do today. The consensus view was that Trump\u2019s sheer unpredictability, opposition to free trade, bombastic and often-shocking comments - plus the vague and uncosted nature of his proposals - would scare investors out of town. But instead, we got a knee-jerk selloff yesterday, followed very swiftly by a bounceback (which Asia just caught up with.) It\u2019s a lesson to all of us about how markets react, as Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Buy the rumour, sell the news or in this case, sell the rumour and buy the news. We were all told this when we first arrived in dealing rooms and it is used to explain why academics and non-market participants are so often confused by the reaction of markets to events. I\u2019m not sure I can remember a better example of this maxim than the last week\u2019s market reaction to changing speculation about the outcome of the US Presidential election, and then to what happened. The result is plenty of egg on the face of all sorts of people. Mine included. So instead, investors quickly began reassessing the implications of a Trump presidency, and a Republican-controlled Congress. Kit says: It is widely expected that President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts, particularly for corporations, that will be positive for growth and will boost inflation. It may not be that simple for Trump to get things done -- the Tea Party wing won\u2019t like the thought of a debt-fuelled stimulus plan, for starters. Good morning from London, where bleary-eyed traders have returned to their desks. We\u2019re not expecting a repeat of the huge rally seen in Asia overnight - London had its Trump rally yesterday afternoon. But the markets are still expected to rise, as the City continues to defy expectations and take yesterday\u2019s shock election result in its stride. You might have thought that the sight of anti-Trump demonstrations at several major US cities overnight would alarm the markets. But right now, they\u2019re more interested in the next president\u2019s promise of a fiscal stimulus. Also, the graceful and mature way that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama reacted to Trump\u2019s win has also calmed nerves -- investors like a peaceful transfer of power. A huge recovery on Asia Pacific\u2019s stock markets as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. Plenty of commentators have doubts about whether the upbeat impact of Trump\u2019s victory can be sustained across the region but the impact is overwhelmingly positive for now. Here are the main points of the day so far: Share markets had one of their best days for years. The Nikkei rose 6.72% thanks to a weaker yen while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 3.34%. South Korea, Hong Kong and China all up too Europe and the US due to open up The US dollar dipped slightly from Wednesday\u2019s highs to 105.2740 Japanese yen while US bond yields spiked amid expectation of Fed rate hike in December Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to quit, the WSJ reports China fixes the yuan at its lowest for six years while JP Morgan warns of possible trade shock S&amp;P affirms US AA+/A-1+ rating amid concern about Trump\u2019s \u2018inexperience\u2019 Construction commodities surge with iron ore at 30-month high and copper at 16-month high Thanks for reading \u2013 the indefatigable Graeme Wearden will take the reins from London in a moment. Oliver Holmes, our south-east Asia correspondent, has been looking at the impact of Trump\u2019s win on his business interests in the region. Oliver writes: Despite the global downturn, two companies in the Philippines and Indonesia that are linked to Trump saw their shares soar on news that he had been elected president. Shares in a Philippine firm building a 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila jumped by a massive 20%, from 1.22 to 1.47 US cents on the local stock market. The main index on the Philippine Stock Exchange fell, however, by 2.5%. In Indonesia, shares in a company controlled by Trump\u2019s local business partner, tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, also surged by 23%. The Jakarta stock exchange dropped by 1.4% on Wednesday. Trump and Tanoesoedibjo plan to build a resort and a golf course in west Java, projects that many in Indonesia \u2014 the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation \u2014 condemned last year when Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A huge day for the Japanese stock market which soared 1,092.88 points to 17,344.42, a rise of 6.72%. There have been big moves in the bond markets in the past 24 hours as investors have dumped the safety of government paper in favour of equities and the dollar. Yields on US Treasury 10-year notes reversed an initial plunge to 1.716% and bolted to 2.09% overnight as the price of bonds dropped. The net rise of 21 basis points was the largest daily increase since July 2013, Reuters said. There\u2019s also an expectation that the Fed will raise rates in December, with a possible US fiscal stimulus seeing the return of inflation and more rate rises. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. Futures trading suggests Europe and the US will rejoin the party when the markets open later today. Spread better IG sees the FTSE100 up 0.5% at 6940 points, while the Dax in Germany will be up 0.68% at 10,715 points. The Dow Jones on Wall Street is set to open up around 60 points. The Nikkei has gone even better than the ASX today with a rise nearly 7%, helped by a drop in the yen as the US dollar received a Trump bump as we might now have to call it. But the authorities are still worried that they might have to act to keep the yen down in future. Hiroshi Watanabe, former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters that \u201cif the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene\u201d, regardless of US concerns about such action. If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. It\u2019s been a good day for investors down under \u2013 the best in fact since 2011, AAP reports. The ASX/S&amp;P200 has closed up 172.2 points, or 3.34%, at 5,328.8 points, adding $50bn to the market\u2019s value, more than making up for yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining and construction stocks led the way on hopes of a boom in the US. Surging iron ore prices also helped, soaring past the 2016 peak to $71 a tonne. Copper \u2013 a key construction material \u2013 also jumped 4% to a 16-month high, Reuters reported. There\u2019s a lot of commentary around today about Trump\u2019s trade policies and what they will mean for the global economy. We\u2019ve already heard from JP Morgan and Saul Eslake. And here\u2019s Paul Bloxham from HSBC in Australia, speaking to Australian Associated Press. For Australia, the main negative impact seems likely to be the effect that reduced global trade could have on Asian growth, given Asia\u2019s high trade reliance. Continued strengthening of Australia\u2019s economic ties to China should be a priority as it would help support local growth even in the face of rising global trade protectionism. But Standard Life, in a research note quoted by AAP, saw the possibility that Trump could moderate his campaign promises, which included putting tariffs of 45% on Chinese goods and 35% on Mexican goods, in order to avoid disruption. It is plausible that the new administration will not ramp up tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, content instead to bury the prospect of new trade agreements and make more use of enforcement clauses in existing agreements. Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to an adviser, despite speculation that he might try to end her term prematurely. Judy Shelton, an economist and senior fellow at the Atlas Network and adviser to Trump on monetary policy, told the Wall Street Journal that \u201che\u2019s not urging her to resign at all\u201d. However, the Journal reports that Shelton did concede that Trump was minded to replace Yellen when she completes her first term in 2018. He\u2019s saying he\u2019d want someone whose thinking is more in keeping with his own. Trump was openly critical of Yellen in one of the presidential debates in September, saying that interest rates had been kept too low and that asset bubbles created by loose monetary settings would eventually burst. JP Morgan\u2019s team in Australia have been looking at what Trump\u2019s win could mean for the global economy \u2013 and Australia\u2019s. They say that a US fiscal stimulus would have limited benefits for the rest of the world while trade barriers could mean trouble for trading partners. A US policy-induced trade shock will be negative for global growth. This leaves risks to global growth more asymmetric than was previously the case. Second, the distribution of risks to Chinese growth have shifted to the downside, given the increased probability of rising tensions in US-China trade relations and weaker Chinese export growth. A trade shock could in turn damage the US. A marked slowing in US growth might not be an issue, except that growth in the rest of the global economy doesn\u2019t look robust enough \u2013 particularly given limited scope for additional policy support \u2013 to provide much of a buffer. And even in the event that US growth slows on a trade shock, this will likely be more inflationary (via higher import prices) than would have otherwise been the case, meaning that the growth and inflation trade-off in the US becomes less favourable. And that means that interest rate cuts are back on the horizon in Australia. For the RBA, we think this underscores the risk that rates are likely to go lower in Australia. All else equal, domestic growth needs to be stronger to provide an offset to external shocks, should they occur. US billionaire Carl Icahn apparently cashed in on the stock market panic over Trump\u2019s election victory. The longtime Trump supporter told CNN Money that he left the Republican\u2019s victory party in Manhattan in the early hours of Wednesday to go home and buy \u201ca lot of stock\u201d in the plunging overnight market. I\u2019m glad I did that. I guess that\u2019s what makes me happy today too ... I personally don\u2019t believe that Trump is bad for the market necessarily. OK, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacfic shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u2019s losses. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87 ASX/S&amp;P200 up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u2019s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010 Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade More on the implications for Asia\u2019s big emerging economies \u2013 and Australia. Saul Eslake, the independent economist, has warned about the implications for Asutralia if Trump were to start a trade war with China and undermine the Fed, pushing the US dollar down. [This would create] a great deal of uncertainty in our part of the world, about the geopolitical environment by making a less wholesome commitment to longstanding US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan ... Those things, particulary a trade war with China, would be highly negative for Australia. Like every measure in the last 24 hours, the US dollar has been topsy-turvy. The chance of a Fed rate cut dropped to 30% on Wednesday but is now more than 80%, according to IG. The dollar index against major currencies recovered from 95.885 on Wednesday to around 98.448 on Thursday. But the longer-term outlook is uncertain as Trump pushes his protectionist agenda (see below). Tim Condon, an Singapore-based economist at ING, told Reuters: We expect a Trump Treasury to elevate the importance of the bilateral trade surplus with the US in identifying currency manipulators and intensify pressure on trade partners to allow currencies to appreciate. The yuan has been fixed today at 6.7885 \u2013 its lowest point since September 2010. Bearing in mind that Trump labelled China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his way to winning the presidency, the issue could prove to be a flashpoint between the two countries. China has pushed the value of its currency steadily downwards in the past year \u2013 very clumsily to begin with, sparking last year\u2019s mini-stock market crash \u2013 as it tries to export its way out of slowing economic growth. But everyone else has got the same idea (including Abe of course). The US dollar is holding its gains on Thursday and was sitting at 105.32 yen, up from below 102 on Wednesday. But for Trump\u2019s manufacturing recovery to work you expect that he will want it come down. The Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is planning to meet the US president-elect in New York on 17 November, a Japanese government official has said. Reuters reports that the pair had \u201ctalked by telephone and confirmed close cooperation between their two nations\u201d. It might be interesting to hear what they have to say to each other about trade and the economy. Like China, Japan has a lot to be worried about. Trump is an avowed opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal which would be a huge blow for Abe\u2019s plans to boost his country\u2019s huge manufacturing sector. The commodities market is looking slightly different to stocks today. While equities are surging ahead, the price of oil has dropped amid concerns about the impact of Trump on global trade. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 20c at $45.07 a barrel at 0131 GMT on Thursday. The more widely traded Brent was at $46.29 per barrel, down 7% from the last close. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters: The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand. Gold meanwhile dipped overnight $1,278.25 an ounce as risk receded in the markets. It rose nearly 5% to $1,337.40 on Wednesday before tumbling back down as US markets reacted positively to the Trump win. Reuters reports that S&amp;P, the ratings agency, has affirmed the country\u2019s investment-grade AA+/A-1+ sovereign rating on Wednesday while maintaining its stable outlook. It welcomed calls for unity from all sides of US politics in the wake of Trump\u2019s win but \u201chigh general government debt and increased uncertainty\u201d meant there it could not restore the coveted AAA rating it removed in 2011. Its analysis feels like a good summary of market sentiment: Given Mr Trump\u2019s lack of experience in public office, and his win as a political outsider without an established policy track record, there is a degree of uncertainty over policy formulation and execution. However, there is a difference between campaign rhetoric and concrete policy proposals and execution once in office. We await further information on the formation of a cabinet and policy proposals, particularly once the president-elect assumes office. Alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House of Representatives. Hence, the president-elect and the Republicans have a mandate for and ability to effect policy change more easily than with a more divided government in recent years. Trading has been underway for an hour now in Japan and Korea. Here\u2019s where the main indexes stand: Nikkei up 5.7% to 17,180 points Kospi in South Korea up 1.7% to 1,991 ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia up 2.88% to 5,305 points The yen, which gained so much during yesterday\u2019s turmoil, fell sharply overnight as the US dollar recovered. It\u2019s now at 105.6740, close to a four-month high. The pound and the euro are both down slightly against the greenback however, as the pattern from yesterday is reversed. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac in Australia, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hasn\u2019t waited around to see what a Trump presidency might mean for US monetary policy \u2013 it cut its base rate 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75% this morning. The move was expected and is the third cut this year. It\u2019s driven partly by a need to get the NZ dollar down to help the country\u2019s huge dairy industry. Governor Graeme Wheeler said the rate-setters had met on Thursday to discuss whether the cut was still needed in the wake of Trump\u2019s win. They decided it was but pushed back on expectations of yet another reduction soon. He said: We think at this stage that we won\u2019t need another cut. The economy is doing well and you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to create excessive volatility in respect of interest rates and output in the exchange rate by surprising the market with interest rate adjustments. This is an interesting chart. Wednesday saw one of the biggest drops in volatility ever recorded as the markets quickly put their concerns behind them and went into risk-on mode. But as with Australia, it\u2019s not clear where this is going. A Trump presidency promises a more aggressive US trading position which the markets have implicitly welcomed. But not everyone can be winners here, can they? China is the obvious loser in Asia if, let\u2019s say, Trump tries to force Apple to make its iPhones in the US instead of Shenzhen and Shangahi. Here\u2019s a snippet from Larry Elliott\u2019s piece: Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside: Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u2019s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems. The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the Nikkei rising more than 6%, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. The Kospi in Seoul is also up. The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. But experts say it\u2019s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win. Here\u2019s Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com: I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics, but could suffer from the rise in US bonds, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u2019t go with those moves higher. Huge lead from Australia this morning. The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up nearly 3% and resource and financial stocks have led the way. The iron ore producer Fortescue is the top riser at well over 10.6% but Macquarie and BHP have also shown big gains. My colleague Melissa Davey has just filed this report on the morning\u2019s surge. Meanwhile, Chris Weston at IG in Melbourne has this: The combination of huge gains in materials, fiscals and energy should push the ASX 200 3.4%, which if it closes at that level would be the strongest gain since 6 October 2011 Hello and welcome to the markets live blog from Sydney. Well, that didn\u2019t turn out quite how it was expected to \u2013 on a number of levels. The surprise of Trump\u2019s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u2019t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u2019s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Here\u2019s how they finished in the US and Europe The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. FTSE100 up 1% to 6,911.84 Dax up 1.56% to 10,646 In Australia the market has already taken that lead and opened up by nearly 3%. Can it be sustained? Here\u2019s one informed verdict. Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney, said: The stunning turn in sentiment suggests there is now a consensus building that much of the policy announced during the campaign was a sales pitch rather than a commitment to act. Investors ignored the potential for damage to international trade and growth prospects and focussed on Republican control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. This offers the prospect of reform that could stimulate the US economy. However, last night\u2019s action may be as good as it gets for markets for some time. Policy uncertainty and populist agendas rarely lead to sustainable economic growth. There\u2019s much to look at and talk about. But in the meantime start with our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s examination of what a Trump win might mean for the global economy.",

                "body":"<p>The texts began arriving on customers\u2019 phones over the weekend: Tesco Bank had spotted unusual activity on a significant number of current accounts, and was getting in touch with customers to alert them. But that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/tesco-bank-cyber-thieves-25m\" title=\"\">wasn\u2019t enough to prevent \u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts</a>, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery.</p> <p>The damage to the bank\u2019s reputation may be significant \u2013 but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users.</p> <p>The hackers\u2019 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d</p> <p>And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come.</p> <p>\u201cBecause a lot of economies aren\u2019t in good shape, you\u2019ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u201d says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u2019s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u2019m pretty sure it will get worse.\u201d</p> <p>The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32&#xa0;transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software.</p> <p>It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u2013 and number of accounts \u2013 are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u2013 some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware.</p> <p>And in late 2015, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u2019 PCs.</p> <p>There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u2019s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation.

What\u2019s to stop it being done to any bank every night?</p> <p>The idea of banks building up a false sense of security before a disaster might sound familiar. Simon Moores, an independent consultant on security, likens the situation now to the US financial market in 2006/7, when complacency over the inherent risks of mortgage-based products was compounded by ratings agencies which had an interest in certifying sketchy financial instruments as safe. \u201cIt\u2019s just like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/30/michael-lewis-the-big-short-interview\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Short</em></a>,\u201d Moores says, referring to the film and book about the lead-up to the financial collapse, which was forecast by only a few. \u201cThe computer security industry is worth \u00a330bn, but it doesn\u2019t work any more. Having a box to protect your bank website or business doesn\u2019t work.

The hackers compromised internal computers and used video feeds for months to learn daily routines.</p> <p>Moores points out that 2015 was a record year for cyber-attacks globally \u2013 but that\u2019s only because 2016 hasn\u2019t finished yet. Malware \u2013 which tries to attack PCs or corporate systems \u2013 is on the rise: \u201cThere are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation, and reportedly every day there\u2019s another 1.25 million \u2018polymorphic\u2019 threats [which change as they are copied between machines, making identification harder].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3460967f6331b319589b08b33e1512d40ef6528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3460967f6331b319589b08b33e1512d40ef6528/0_139_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For banks, the attraction of online banking is clear: it doesn\u2019t require expensive offices in high streets, or the employment of thousands of tellers who might be vulnerable to criminals through blackmail or greed. Instead, it relies on computers, and a relatively small and highly trained (and well-paid) staff, while the customer-support function normally done by tellers can be outsourced to call centres that have little more access than ordinary customers to the banks\u2019 databases.</p> <p>For the customer, online banking should mean greater convenience \u2013 it can be done anywhere and any time you can get an internet connection \u2013 and reliability, since the challenges (such as passwords and memorable words or phrases) you face to log on successfully are more complex than a simple four-digit number at a cash machine.</p> <p>But for both, inserting a computer between the customer and the bank has opened up new risks from malware targeting web browsers, computers and mobile phones. Browsers, software and computers \u2013 both the customers\u2019 and the banks\u2019 \u2013 can have mysterious bugs which allow access to hackers and leave almost no trace; there is a constant need for bug-finding and updates to defeat them.</p> <p>Even while banks strengthen their software, though, the weak link can lie outside.

                "bodyText":"The texts began arriving on customers\u2019 phones over the weekend: Tesco Bank had spotted unusual activity on a significant number of current accounts, and was getting in touch with customers to alert them. But that wasn\u2019t enough to prevent \u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery. The damage to the bank\u2019s reputation may be significant \u2013 but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users. The hackers\u2019 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come. \u201cBecause a lot of economies aren\u2019t in good shape, you\u2019ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u201d says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u2019s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u2019m pretty sure it will get worse.\u201d The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32 transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software. It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u2013 and number of accounts \u2013 are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u2013 some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware. And in late 2015, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u2019 PCs. There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u2019s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation. The question, still unanswered, is how the accounts were targeted. It is possible that the hackers found a weakness in the back-office systems \u2013 possibly from a current or former employee, suggests Kolochenko. Tesco Bank declined to discuss whether there are any patterns in the accounts that were targeted: \u201cThis is a criminal matter, and so we are constrained in what we can say,\u201d a spokesman said. He declined to say whether any criminals had been identified or what lines of investigation were being pursued. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told MPs last week that \u201cthere are elements of this [attack] that look unprecedented\u201d, but did not elucidate. What parts are unprecedented? The fraud was far from the largest conducted on a UK bank; in September, the23-year-old head of a fraud ring, Feezan Hameed, was jailed for 11 years, after his gang stole \u00a3113m from British banks. They fooled people into thinking they were talking to their bank, and got them to hand over their internet details \u2013 which he would then use to get access to their accounts. Only \u00a347m has been recovered. So if the FCA\u2019s Bailey is worried, it must be about the online nature and the scale of the attack \u2013 not its value. And this is the concern: if criminals can compromise 9,000 accounts in a matter of hours during a weekend and siphon off an average of \u00a3280 from each one before being spotted, what\u2019s to prevent it being done to an even greater number of accounts for greater amounts of money, and leaving banks to pick up the pieces?

By 2011, there were versions of Zeus that infected smartphones running on Google\u2019s Android, putting banking apps at risk. So far though, banks appear to have managed to stay ahead in the arms race; the growth in the use of smartphones may actually have helped, because their security model is generally better than PCs, holding apps in deeper \u201csilos\u201d.
