                "bodyText":"In a late development, President Obama has just spoken to reporters after a meeting with his economic team. Obama declared that the US is \u201cpretty darn great\u201d right now -- a rebuttal at Donald Trump and his \u201cMake America Great\u201d campaign. Our economy is the envy of the world, he claimed. And the president was adamant that his policies had worked, delivering 72 months of jobs growth. The priority is to continue that recovery, giving people better jobs and higher salaries, and making the economy \u201cgrow even faster\u201d. I\u2019ll be back later with the Wall Street close.... A new burst of market optimism has driven shares in London to their highest closing level since the start of 2016. Mining stocks drove the market higher, helped by the sight of copper and iron ore prices touching their highest levels since last autumn. Today\u2019s US jobs report hasn\u2019t scared the horses either, even though the poor wage growth took the shine off a decent rise in employment. The FTSE 100 has closed for the night, and the week, up 69 points or 1.1% at 6,199. That\u2019s its highest close since New Year\u2019s Eve. The Footsie has now surged by 12% since mid-February, when shares hit their lowest level since 2012 amid fears of a new banking crisis and a global recession. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sums up the situation: Shares in Europe added to early gains after the US employment report eased concerns of a slowdown in the US economy without increasing chances of a faster pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Major averages in both the US and Europe are on track for a third successive week of gains. The strength in equities is largely thanks to oil prices being back close to where they started the year but today\u2019s gains were reinforced by the biggest rise in the fix for the Chinese yuan in three weeks. The stabilisation of the Chinese currency as well as efforts this week by authorities in China to bring down excess capacity in its commodities industries helped miners lead gains on the FTSE 100. Anglo American led the UK index with near double-digit daily gains in hot pursuit from sector-peers BHP Billiton, Glencore and Antofagasta as industrial and precious metals benefitted from a slide in the US dollar. The stock markets are pushing higher, as investors dash to buy shares before the European close in 15 minutes time. Wall Street is now in positive territory, and the FTSE 100 is up 68 points at 6,200, again of 1.1%. Mining stocks continue to lead the rally, amid chatter that the commodity crunch has hit a bottom. Bloomberg News\u2019 Matt Boes has been truffling through the Jobs Report. He\u2019s spotted that unemployment among America\u2019s Hispanic workers fell sharply last month. And the rate of retirements across the labor market dipped a little too. Jason Furman, who chairs president Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, insists that \u201cThis is a very good report\u201d. The fall in the underemployment rate, and the rise in the participation rate, show that the labor market continued to improve, argues Furman on Bloomberg TV. But what about the 0.1% fall in wages in February? Furman agrees that wage growth isn\u2019t good enough. However, January saw unusually high wage growth of 0.5%. On average, the last two months showed wages growing faster than inflation, he says. The drop in average earnings has tainted an otherwise solid US jobs report, says David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading platform XTB.com. Overall the report paints a fairly strong picture of continued strength in the US labour market with the 4-month moving average remaining firmly above the 200k mark and the unemployment rate of 4.9% remains near its lowest level in a decade. The first contraction in average hourly earnings since January last year came as an unexpected shock, although having said that there remains little evidence here of any real weakness in the labour market that would be prohibitive for Fed rate hikes in the not too distant future.\u2019 The financial markets are not particularly impressed by today\u2019s jobs report. Wall Street has just opened, and the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 13 points or 0.08% to 16,931. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 0.3% Markets are still up in Europe, though, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,163 points - close to its highest levels this year. Despite a month-on-month fall in wages, overall today\u2019s report bodes well for consumption, says Nina Skero, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Strong job creation will make consumers both more able and, via boosted consumer confidence, more willing to spend. A healthy consumer spending outlook is especially important for the US economy as the country faces challenges on other economic fronts. CEBR agrees that the Fed could raise interest rates again soon -- something Skero calls \u201cunwarranted and premature\u201d. They also sent over this chart, showing the steady recovery in the US labor market since 2010. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, is quite upbeat about the Non-Farm Payroll. He reckons it has \u201cshaken off the doubters\u201d who thought the US economy was weakening. Today\u2019s jobs report is a mixed bag, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. But on balance, he thinks it could tee-up a Federal Reserve rate hike this summer: Overall, it\u2019s clear that labour market conditions are still strong. The lack of a more marked pick-up in wage growth is the only missing element. But as far as the Fed is concerned, it is already seeing a clear acceleration in core price inflation, so it can\u2019t delay raising interest rates for much longer. A June rate hike is coming. Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has a cunning theory to explain the surprise dip in earnings (from $25.38 per hour to $25.35). He thinks it\u2019s all in the timing. Workers who are paid every fortnight would have received their second wage payment on 15th February, three days AFTER the Non-Farm Payroll survey took place. Shepherdson says: Don\u2019t be taken in by the dip in hourly earnings; it just continues a very consistent pattern of undershooting in months when the 15th \u2013 payday for people paid semi-monthly \u2013 falls after the employment survey week. Same thing in March, but then there\u2019ll be a huge rebound, putting year-on-year wage growth at new highs. This tweet suggests he\u2019s right: Financial commentators agree that today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report shows solid job creation, but lacklustre wage growth. Here\u2019s some reaction: Most of the jobs created in America last month were in healthcare, retail, and in bars and restaurants. Here\u2019s a breakdown Health care and social assistance: +57,000 jobs. Retail trade: +55,000. Food services and drinking places: +40,000 jobs. Private educational services: +28,000 Construction: +19,000, Mining: lost -19,000 jobs The BLS adds that: Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.5%), adult women (4.5%), teenagers (15.6%), Whites (4.3%), Blacks (8.8%), Asians (3.8%), and Hispanics (5.4%) showed little or no change in February. More Americans are returning to the jobs market. The labor force participation rate rose to 62.9% from 62.7% in February. That means more people are either in work, or looking. That could explain why wage growth is disappointing -- employers don\u2019t need to offer large pay rises if there is still \u2018slack\u2019 in the jobs market. Alan Krueger, Princeton economics professor, says the fall in earnings last month is a blow. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: I\u2019m surprised that we didn\u2019t see a pickup in wages....This report, behind the headline jobs number, is disappointing. Put the confetti away. Although job creation was strong, wage growth was not. Average earnings of America\u2019s private workers FELL by 0.1% during February, reversing the 0.5% rise seen in January. That means wages are only 2.2% higher than a year ago. Today\u2019s report says: In February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 3 cents to $25.35, following an increase of 12 cents in January. Average hourly earnings have risen by 2.2 percent over the year. Job creation was quite broad-based last month. The Bureau for Labour Statistics says: Employment gains occurred in health care and social assistance, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and private educational services, Job losses continued in mining. The US unemployment rate remains at an eight-year low of 4.9%. Here we go! The US economy created 242,000 new jobs last month -- a better performance than expected. That beats market expectations for 195,00 new jobs And January\u2019s figure have been revised higher too, to show that 172,000 new hires (up from 151k originally). More to follow... Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, reckons Wall Street will be most interested in the earnings figures: We expect markets to concentrate on wage growth rather than non-farm payrolls. It is, after all, inflation that\u2019s the key metric for the Fed right now. The waiting is nearly over. In 30 minute time, the latest US jobs report will hit the tape and we\u2019ll know how America\u2019s employment market performed last month. Here\u2019s what to watch for: 1) How many new jobs were created in February. The consensus is for a 195,000 increase in the Non-Farm Payroll, up from a disappointing 151,000 in January. As usual, Wall Street estimates vary quite widely, from 165k to 220k. Some observers are more pessimistic though, such: There\u2019s also a chance that January\u2019s figures will be revised. 2) Where\u2019s the wage growth? We got a surprisingly strong 0.5% pick-up in earnings growth last month, suggesting that the recovery was reaching workers\u2019 pockets 3) Has the unemployment rate come down again? It hit an eight-year low of 4.9% in January, which should have reassured the Federal Reserve over its December rate hike. 4) But what\u2019s the deeper picture? The labor force participation rate has been close to its lowest in decades, showing that many Americans simply stopped looking for work. Underemployment is another key measure; the report will show how many people wanted to work more hours. Arnaud Masset, analyst at Swiss online bank Swissquote, says the Payroll will shed light on whether America\u2019s economy risks recession this year. Even the most hawkish Fed members have stopped giving overly optimistic speeches, instead becoming more cautious about the US outlook. More and more market participants are wondering if the US economy is on the edge of a recession or whether this is just a temporary setback (apparently the temporary setback has become seasonal since last year\u2026). In our opinion, it is still too early to ring alarm bells.\u201d Demand for Brazilian assets is surging today, after former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was detained by police. Lula was dragged into the long-running corruption scandal that has gripped Brazil for months, when federal officers raided his house early this morning. Our Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts explains why the move is so important: The detention of the influential Workers party politician \u2013 who is best known by his nickname Lula \u2013 marks a dramatic new phase of the Lava Jato (\u201ccarwash\u201d) probe into bribery and kickback allegations involving the nation\u2019s leading companies and dozens of congressmen. It is likely to further add to the pressure on the government of president Dilma Rousseff, who is already struggling with an impeachment challenge, economic recession and the Zika epidemic. More here: Brazilian police detain former president Lula in corruption inquiry Investors are piling into Brazilian assets, anticipating political change. Brazil is currently suffering a deep recession, and rampant inflation. The Brazilian real has already surged by over 2% against the US dollar, from 3.8 against the $1 to 3.7. The stock market is tipped to leap by 6% when trading begins. Today\u2019s flurry of optimism is also pushing copper to its highest level since mid-November, as Reuters reports: Copper prices rose to their highest in nearly four months on Friday, boosted by optimism about demand prospects and output cuts that will help the market move towards balance. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 1% at $4,905 a tonne at 1048 GMT, on course for its largest weekly gain since September last year. Copper earlier touched $4,933 a tonne, its highest since November 12. Iron ore has hit its highest level since last October this morning, continuing a recent rally. Iron ore is benefitting from reports that China is cutting its steel sector and laying off millions of workers, in an attempt to cut oversupply. But traders should be cautious, given iron ore demand is so closely linked to China\u2019s economic growth. Trimming supply doesn\u2019t guarantee demand for steel, as the Wall Street Journal warned this week. Here\u2019s our take on today\u2019s car figures: It\u2019s a bleak morning for workers at troubled UK high street chain BHS. The company\u2019s owners are planning to cut 350 jobs, and is also threatening to close half its stores unless landlords cut the rent. The job cuts come a day after BHS filed for insolvency protection, as we reported yesterday. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the story: The retailer intends to make 220 people redundant in stores and 150 people in head office. Another 100 roles that had not been filled in BHS\u2019s head office in recent months will also be scrapped, meaning its central operations will shrink by roughy a third. BHS bosses briefed staff about the job losses and the turnaround plan on Friday morning. As well as the job cuts, BHS is threatening to close up to half its stores if landlords do not agree to reduce the rents. BHS has filed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding, in an attempt to cut its costs. Here\u2019s the full story: The FTSE 100 is on track to close at a new 2016 high, although the US jobs report could yet change that. After three hours of trading, the blue chip index is up a steady 0.5% at 6161 points. Most other European indices are higher too, following Asia\u2019s lead overnight, meaning global markets are still at a two-month high. Ryan Myerberg, a portfolio manager at Janus Capital, says optimism has come pouring back into the markets recently. He says (via Reuters): \u201cWe didn\u2019t believe the \u2018world is going to end\u2019 story, but the way the mood has changed in the last couple of weeks is just crazy.\u201d Since the beginning of the year it has been like driving down the motorway where every couple of miles a tractor has overturned, whether that be China, oil, the banks, that you have to swerve around.\u201d And this tweet shows how some emerging markets have led the rally in 2016, after a couple of challenging years. Money has been pouring back into gold this morning, driving the price of billion up to a 13-month high. Gold just hit $1274.50 an ounce, up 1% today, its highest point since February 2015. It\u2019s surprising to see gold and shares both rallying. But it appears that gold is in demand from investors who are worried about negative interest rates, which have helped drive down the return on many safer assets. There\u2019s also a theory that Chinese demand for gold could jump if Beijing imposes capital controls, to prevent money leaving the country. The London Stock Exchange has shown by two rivals want to leap into bed with it, by posting a 31% jump in profits for the last year. CEO Xavier Rolet remained loyal to the main suiter, Deutsche B\u00f6rse. He said the merger of equals proposed last week was \u201ccompelling opportunity\u201d to create a dominant new global trading group. But the strong results may also encourage Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which runs the New York stock exchange, to muscle in. It\u2019s already considering its options. Joshua Raymond, market analyst at online trading firm XTB.com, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s been a solid year for the LSE. The focus of course now is whether a rival bid emerges from ICE that could spark a bidding war, or if the firms major shareholders remain convinced a tie up with Deutsche B\u00f6rse on the already announced conditions is the best way forward for the trading house.\u201d Britain\u2019s car industry has posted its strongest February sales growth in 12 years, despite another drop in demand for Volkswagen cars New figures from the SMMT show that the new car market grew by 8.4% year-on-year last month, Some 83,395 vehicles being registered, which is the best performance for a February since 2004: The figures also confirm that the emission scandal continues to hurt Volkswagen. Its car sales fell by 13% year on year, from 7,710 to 6,694. Back to economics...and Italy\u2019s statistics office has confirmed that the Italian economy grew by a measly 0.1% in the last three months of 2015. Newsflash: Social networking giant Facebook is shaking up its corporate set-up, which should mean it pays rather more tax in the UK. The move follows heavy criticism of US tech firms for using complicated corporate structures to cut their tax liability, apparently legally. The BBC\u2019s business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has learned that Facebook will no longer route advertising sales to big UK clients through its Irish operation. He\u2019s seen an internal memo, which explains that: On Monday, we will start notifying large UK customers that from the start of April, they will receive invoices from Facebook UK and not Facebook Ireland, What this means in practice is that UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK, not Ireland. Facebook UK will then record the revenue from these sales. The move is expected to \u201cprovide transparency to Facebook\u2019s operations in the UK\u201d, the memo adds. Here\u2019s the full story: Facebook to pay millions of pounds more in UK tax Last autumn, it emerged that Facebook UK has only paid \u00a34,327 in UK corporation tax. It made revenues of \u00a3105m, but booked an accounting loss of \u00a328.5m in Britain in 2014, after paying out more than \u00a335m to its 362 staff in a share bonus scheme. Advertising giant WPP has flagged up the EU referendum as a clear risk to growth prospects this year. WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell warned against \u201cDon Draper-ish\u201d optimism, given the threats to confidence. He cited the conflict in the Ukraine and the Middle East, and also the Brexit risk, telling the City that: \u201cThe somewhat surprising result of the UK general lection (at least to the pollsters), with the Conservatives winning an overall majority, has resulted in an uncertainty-stimulating EU referendum, now pegged for 23 June.\u201d Shares in WPP are up 0.7% this morning, after it posted solid sales growth of 4.9% in the final quarter of the year. Mining shares are now at a four-month high, having rocketed by 25% this year: European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, as investors get ready for his afternoon\u2019s US jobs data. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or 0.6%, to 6166 - which is nearly its highest level this year. Mining companies are topping the biggest risers, indicating renewed confidence in economic prospects, particularly in emerging markets. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is making another pitch higher in early trade despite yesterday\u2019s suggestions that the bulls may be running out of momentum. Gains are broad based with natural resources stocks once again finding themselves at the top of the board with continued gains for underlying metals prices still lending support here. After a very ropy start to 2016, world stock markets are now at a two-month high That\u2019s according to the MSCI World Market index, which tracks shares in 46 different countries. As this chats shows, share prices are now back at early January levels, before the stock market turmoil began. The recent rally suggests that investor panic over a global downturn was overdone. Now, though, there is talk about whether the market is over-bought - particularly as this week\u2019s manufacturing and service-sector data has been somewhat patchy. Chris Weston of IG explains why the rally could fizzle out: There is an air of fatigue from the bulls in a number of developed equity markets, but they continue to grind higher.... But the market is in need of some injection of new news to provide an injection of inspiration and cause a new leg higher. It seems unlikely this inspiration comes from today\u2019s US payrolls. Stock markets across Asia have rallied today as investors express optimism ahead of this afternoon\u2019s America\u2019s employment report. Over in Tokyo, the Nikkei gained 0.3%. That pushed the Japanese index to a one-month high, up over 5% this week. Chinese traders showed some confidence too, pushing the Shanghai index up by 0.5%. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, reckons that investors are less worried about the global economy. They are also anticipating that the US Federal Reserve will be reluctant to raise borrowing costs this year, given recent turbulence. Fujito said (via Reuters): Globally, markets are rolling back the extreme risk-off trading they did in January and February. \u201cPart of the reason is that the Fed seems to be easing its insistence on raising rates.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. One more heave, chaps. After a heavy week for economic data, it\u2019s the big one today - the US Non-Farm Payroll for February, which is due at 1.30pm GMT. The NFP will show how many new jobs were created across America\u2019s economy last month, and also show whether wages picked up or not. Although prone to later revisions, the Payroll is a crucial measure of the health of the US labo u r market, at a time when worries over the global economy are pretty intense. Economists predict that 195,000 Americans got hired last month, leaving the unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9%. Earnings are tipped to rise by 0.2% month-on-month, down from a chunky 0.5% rise in January. A surprisingly good, or bad, Payroll number could give the markets a shunt and renew concerns about a global recession. But as things stand, shares are expected to rise in Europe in early trading, with the main indices called up around 0.5%. Also coming up today.... Japan\u2019s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda has been testifying in Tokyo about monetary policy issues. At 9am,, we get the final estimate of Italian GDP for the last quarter. It will probably confirm that the economy grew by only 0.1%. The latest UK car sales figures (for February) also land at 9am. And in the City, we\u2019re getting results from London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) and advertising group WPP. Traders will be looking for news about the LSE\u2019s planned merger by Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which could bd disrupted by a counter-offer from America\u2019s ICE.",
