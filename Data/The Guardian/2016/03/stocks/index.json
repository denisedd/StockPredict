This also rose, reaching 48.5 from a very soft 45.9 in January. But like the headline index, it remains deep in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contraction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd territory, albeit marginally less so than in January.</p> <p>Moreover, as a guide to payrolls, this is not very reliable.

On a more positive note, new orders remained positive at a respectable 51.5.</p> <p>Markets will no doubt see this survey as a positive release, an excuse for stocks to rally and bond yields to rise.

Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly been a solid start to the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade, with the FTSE-100 putting in another impressive day of gains although with downbeat PMI data out of China - and indeed the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult not to be left thinking that the upside has come about only at the expense of promised further stimulus measures. A strong performance from the oil price helped, with Brent crude currently up 1.2% to $37.04 a barrel. The final scores on the European markets were: The FTSE 100 finished 55.79 points or 0.92% higher at 6152.88, its highest leel since 31 December last year Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was up 2.34% at 9717.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.22% to 4406.84 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 2.21% to 18,011.91 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.77% at 8611.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.65% to 520.08 On Wall Street, ahead of the Super Tuesday US delegate voting, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 300 points or 1.8% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close the blog. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Using the closing prices, also likely to be demoted from the FTSE 100 are Smiths Group, Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Aberdeen Asset Managment. The four replacements as things stand would be Paddy Power Betfair after its merger, hospitals group Mediclinic following a reverse takeover, Morrisons after it was relegated in December at the last review, and Investec. Again, the moves need to be ratified by the FTSE committee on Wednesday. Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct International is being relegated from the FTSE 100 following a Guardian investigation. The demotion is based on tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price of 410p, down 40% since December, and will be confirmed officially by a committee at index compilers FTSE on Wednesday. Full story here: The Draghi comments come from a letter sent today in reply to MEP Jonas Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez. ECB president Mario Draghi has added fuel to the expectations that the central bank will unveil further stimulus measures at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. He said the euro area inflation dynamics continued to be weaker than expected, and there are increased risks to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier outlook, according to Reuters. The agency reports him saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are no limits to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments within our mandate to achieve our objective of inflation rates below,k but close to, 2% over the medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy round-up of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs: Not exactly a convincing recovery is the view of Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, on the ISM figures: The February Institute of Supply Management (ISM ) manufacturing index rose to 49.5 from 47.8 in January. This means that manufacturing is likely to be expanding at a slightly stronger pace than it was in January. But slightly stronger is still a long way from robust. Typically, we see an index of 50 or above as necessary to indicate growth at an acceptable rate, whilst 43.2 is the historical break-even index for contraction or expansion. One key element of this release, which always happens the same week as the US labour report, is the employment index. This also rose, reaching 48.5 from a very soft 45.9 in January. But like the headline index, it remains deep in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contraction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd territory, albeit marginally less so than in January. Moreover, as a guide to payrolls, this is not very reliable. Despite the weak January employment index, January manufacturing payrolls employment actually rose by 29,000, its highest since November 2014. On a more positive note, new orders remained positive at a respectable 51.5. Markets will no doubt see this survey as a positive release, an excuse for stocks to rally and bond yields to rise. But in truth, this is another mixed survey, and not terribly reliable at that. We do not see it as sufficiently robust to warrant the Federal Reserve raising rates again at its March meeting. Here are some of the respondents comments to the ISM: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low oil prices and reduced activity continue affecting our business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Petroleum &amp; Coal Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U.S. business demand is solid; international demand is soft.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Chemical Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mobility spend is up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Computer &amp; Electronic Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business has to get better. And it appears it is. Healthy backlog for 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Fabricated Metal Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very strong demand for product. Material availability very good and commodity pricing continues to be depressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Machinery) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Airlines are still ordering planes and spare parts for plane galleys.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Transportation Equipment) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market is beginning to trend up with spring season on its way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Wood Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not seeing impact from global economic volatility or oil prices. Business is strong and growth projections remain the same.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Miscellaneous Manufacturing) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Orders are coming in stronger than expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Still a bit sluggish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dilemma: David Morrison at Spread Co said: The US ISM Manufacturing PMI beat the consensus expectation by quite a distance. Nevertheless, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to register expansion in a sector which has been declining for over a year now. Earlier today China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Manufacturing PMIs continued to show contraction in the sector. On top of that, there was an unwelcome dip in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Manufacturing PMI as well, suggesting that the hoped-for rebalancing from manufacturing and exporting to consumer demand may not be going as well as hoped. Manufacturing data from across the eurozone and UK was also generally disappointing. Add in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak US Chicago PMI and Pending Home Sales, together with the year-on-year Euro zone CPI print of -0.3% and you have plenty of evidence that the global economic outlook isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly glowing. Of course, what this all means for central bank-fixated investors is that further stimulus can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be far away. Stock market bulls must be praying for a bad US payroll number on Friday to really kibosh the fear of further Fed rate hikes this side of summer. US construction spending is also stronger: And by contrast with the Markit PMI, the manufacturing activity index from the Institute for Supply Management has come in higher than expected. The index came in at 49.5 in February, up from 48.2 in the previous month and better than the 48.5 forecast. This is the highest level since September. The new orders index was flat at 51.5 and the employment index was much stronger than the expected 46.4, coming in at 48.5. Despite the better than expected data, the ISM index still shows a sector in contraction since the figure is below 50. More fuel to the idea that the Federal Reserve will be in no hurry to raise interest rates again. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The February data add to signs of distress in the US manufacturing economy. Production and order book growth continues to worsen, led by falling exports. Jobs are being added at a slower pace and output prices are dropping at a rate not seen since mid-2012. The deterioration in the manufacturing sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance since mid-2014 has broadly tracked the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise, which makes US goods more expensive in overseas markets and leads US consumers to favour cheaper imported goods. With other headwinds including the downturn in the oil sector, heightened uncertainty due to financial market volatility, global growth worries and growing concerns about the presidential election, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that the manufacturing sector is facing its toughest period since the global financial crisis. US manufacturing performed marginally better than expected in February but worse than in January. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 51.3 last month, higher than the initial estimate of 51 and the forecast of 51.2. But it was down on the final figure for January of 52.4. The same pattern was seen in the employment index, which at 51.8 was better than the initial estimate of 51.5 but lower than January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 52.8. The output index at 51.8 was the lowest since October 2013. Ahead of the US manufacturing figures for February - remember there is the Markit PMI followed shortly afterwards by the ISM survey - Wall Street has climbed sharply in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 93 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.8%, as the oil price shows signs of stabilising. Time for a very quick summary. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has posted its slowest growth in almost three years. UK manufacturers have been hurt by the weakening global economy and signs of domestic slowdown, and economists fear further problems ahead. Growth across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector hit a one-year low. Germany and France saw near-stagnation, and firms reported renewed price pressure - a day after the eurozone fell back into deflation. The Eurozone jobless rate has hit a new four and a half-year low. In January, 10.3% of workers were unemployed, around twice the levels in the US and UK. China got the day off to a bad start, with factory activity shrinking again. Analysts say it puts more pressure on Beijing to take further measures to stave off severe economic problems. The financial markets have taken the news well; shares are up across Europe, and the US expected to follow. But there are new signs of unease in the markets, as Japan sells 10-year bonds at a negative yield for the first time ever. Barclays shares have slumped by 10% as investors balk at falling profits and a dividend cut. The London Stock Exchange could be the centre of a tug-of-war, as the owner of the New York stock exchange ponders launching a rival takeover bid. The financial market turmoil of 2015 has knocked around \u00c2\u00a350bn off the value of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20 wealthiest people. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the annual survey of the megarich from Forbes , which reports that Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms tycoon, had a year to forget. His fortune shrank from $77.1bn to $50bn last year. Bill Gates also became a little poorer, but Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Zuckerberg bucked the trend. My colleague Graham Ruddick has read the report, and explains: Bill Gates has been crowned the richest man in the world for the third year in a row, although the Microsoft founder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune also dipped from $79.2bn to $75bn. Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth grew by $11.2bn to give him a total net worth of $44.6bn. Zuckerberg is the sixth richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, Slim, investor Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, the businessman behind the Zara fashion empire, and Gates. Here comes the first slug of economic data from across the Atlantic.... and it show that Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector shrank at a rapid pace in February. The Brazilian manufacturing PMI, which measures activity at hundreds of firms, fell to a three-month low of 44.5 in February, from 47.4 in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the second-fastest contraction since the financial crisis in 2008. And firms also saw their costs jump, due to the weakening Brazilian currency. Markit explains: Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing recession extended to February, with a further drop in incoming new work leading companies to lower production and cut jobs again. Such was the extent of the downturn that firms shed jobs at the second-fastest pace since April 2009. The weaker real continued to exert upward pressure on input costs, which rose at quickest rate since October 2008. Subsequently, tariffs were raised again, with charge inflation reaching a survey peak. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historic day in the financial markets. For the first time ever, investors have paid Japan for the privilege of lending to it for the next decade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Japan auctioned 10-year bonds at an interest rate, or yield, of below zero for the first time ever. That means investors agreed to pay more than the face value of the bonds, which Tokyo will repay in 2026. The FT says that Japan has crossed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial rubicon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; it makes it the first G7 nation to sell 10-year bonds so cheaply. You might think this would be welcome -- government deficits sound less scary when you can borrow for free. But in this case, it means investors are pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects. It also shows the adverse consequences of negative interest rates, which the Bank of Japan imposed last month. Banks lose money on funds left at the BoJ, so they may as well buy 10-year bonds at a small loss instead. But with asset yields so low, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be even harder for banks to generate profits. And could Germany be next? Ten-year bunds are yielding just 0.13% today.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunchtime in the City of London, after a morning of generally downbeat economic news. But shares are still up, though. The FTSE 100 has gained 45 points or 0.75% to a two-month high. The prospect of a bidding war has driven London Stock Exchange Group up 8.5% to the top of the leader board. But Barclays has lost 9% to a three-year low, with traders disappointed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the 600 largest listed European companies, is at a one-month high. Investors simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking about the weakness in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sectors that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen today. Instead, they may be cheered by the oil price. US crude is up 1.7% today at $34.33. Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: European markets have a spring in their step this morning, with the FTSE hitting an eight-week high in early trade. The initial anxiety brought about by yet another batch of disappointing Chinese PMI readings overnight proved unfounded, as the slowdown story begins to play less of a role in global sentiment. Wall Street is expected to turn green at the open too. Wondering where you should have invested your hard-earned money (or your clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) last month? Deutsche Bank has the answer. You should have piled into gold on February 1st, when bullion was $1,128 per ounce. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now $1,245 per ounce, up 10%. If you fancied some FX action, buying the yen against the US dollar would have been profitable too (it strengthened from \u00c2\u00a5121 to \u00c2\u00a5113 to the $1). And you should have steered well away from wheat. It was the worst performing asset class, amid predictions of decent harvests and ample suppliers. The second worst - the Greek stock market, which slumped in the face of deadlock between the Athens government and its creditors over its latest bailout plan. Legal &amp; General, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest asset manager, has just issued a statement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s In-Out EU referendum, scheduled for June 23. L&amp;G believes its business would suffer little impact of the UK public vote to leave the European Union, as it has relatively few customers on the continent. However, it also warns that a Brexit vote would probably have some negative effect on the financial markets, and the real economy. L&amp;G says: We consider that a vote to leave would have little direct impact on trading for Legal &amp; General: our customer base is located very largely in the UK, the US and Asia. It is however probable that a vote to exit, with a potentially lengthy period of negotiation and an uncertain outcome, would create uncertainty for markets and the broader UK economy in which we operate. L&amp;G also warns that there is a lack of clarity over the new trade links which Britain would forge after Brexit, and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the economic case for leaving is unproven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So it will keep the issue under review. As one of the largest investors in the UK, we will be actively listening to companies we invest in, who will be assessing the potential impact for themselves. So, quite a balanced view from L&amp;G, who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem terribly alarmed about Brexit. And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal thinks she knows why.... Alan Greenspan was notoriously opaque when he was the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, joking once that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the former Federal Reserve chairman has developed a new line in clarity in his older year. Greenspan, who turns 90 on Sunday, has sat down with Bloomberg to talk about the global economy. And he criticised the new vogue towards negative interest rates, as central bankers Asked if charging banks a negative interest rate was dangerous, Greenspan said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say dangerous, but it is clearly not productive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big argument about excessively low interest rates for a very long period of time is that it warps the investment pattern on real investments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [As interest rates fall, so does the rate of return which banks get on their assets. However, in a negative interest rate world they cannot keep cutting the cost of their liabilities - customer deposits - without charging savers] Greenspan also warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in trouble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productivity is dead in the water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Output per hour is driven essentially by real capital investment, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way below average, because business people are very uncertain about the future. More here: Greenspan Says Negative Rates `Warp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Investment Behavior The sharp slowdown in UK factory growth last month has disappointed analysts. They are worried that domestic demand weakened in February, compounding the impact of weaker demand from overseas. And the EU referendum could weigh on the sector for several months too. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Zach Witton, Deputy Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After an encouraging start to 2016, the manufacturing PMI took a turn for the worse in February, falling to its lowest level in nearly three years and barely remaining in growth territory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Activity levels deteriorated on the back of weakness in new orders, with domestic demand no longer compensating for lacklustre export orders. The weakness led manufacturing to post job losses for the fifth time in the last seven months. On a brighter note, the weakness was not across the board as new orders for intermediate goods edged higher. Manufacturers face a challenging environment, with subdued demand from emerging markets and the ongoing weakness of the oil price weighing heavily on companies in the oil and gas supply chain. Against this backdrop, manufacturers will be looking at the forthcoming Budget and will want to see the Chancellor avoid adding significant costs at a time when business conditions are tough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weak start to the year continues for the manufacturing sector with even domestic demand unable to contribute to the levels it has done previously. However, amidst the headwinds of slowing global growth, uncertainty over a Brexit and skills shortages in the industry comes the recent depreciation in sterling which may just provide the jump-start that manufacturing exporters need to boost exports and put a spark back into the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank. Domestic demand has been the key driver of UK manufacturing in recent months. But with households showing some Brexit jitters too, UK manufacturing might be heading for a rough time until the referendum is out of the way. As long as the UK votes to stay in the EU, domestic demand will likely pick up again thereafter. If the UK votes to eject itself from its biggest market, things may get much rougher, though. The unemployment rate across the eurozone has hit its lowest level since August 2011, the early months of the debt crisis. The eurozone jobless rate ticked down to 10.3% in January 2016, down from 10.4% in December 2015, for the first time since August 2011. That continues the slow recovery since April 2013, when the euro area jobless rate hit 12.3%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still far too high, especially in Greece and Spain where around one in four are out of work. In the wider EU, the jobless rate dropped to 8.9% from 9.0% - the lowest in over six years. UK factories do have one glimmer of hope -- the recent slump in the pound. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report was conducted before Brexit firms sent sterling down to new seven-year lows, which ought to help exporters.... Barclays shares are being hammered harder, after it reported an 8% fall in profits, halved its dividend and warned of further job cuts. They fell 11% a moment ago, forcing trading to be briefly suspended. More gloom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have posted their slowest growth in almost three years, as the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector slipped to near-stagnation. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck of the sector showed that output slowed sharply, as exports suffered from weakness in the global economy. Firms struggled to attract new business and cut jobs for the second month running. Rob Dobson of Markit says UK firms are being forced to cut prices to attract business, due to weak demand at home and abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The near-stagnation of manufacturing highlights the ongoing fragility of the economic recovery at the start of the year and provides further cover for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly dovish stance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The breadth of the slowdown is especially worrisome. The domestic market is showing signs of weakening while export business continued to fall. Price pressures also remained firmly on the downside, with the survey signalling input costs falling at a double-digit annual pace and average factory gate selling prices showing a further decline. A lot of this is driven by the ongoing weakness of global commodity prices. However, there are also signs that weaker growth is driving up competition between manufacturers to secure new business and among their suppliers too. European stock markets are taking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak manufacturing data in their stride. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 just touched its highest point since the 5th of January, with mining group Anglo American and fashion chain Burberry among the risers. The Footsie is currently up 0.35% at 6117 points, also helped by the bid battle over the London Stock Exchange (up 7%). That means the London market has clawed back almost all the losses suffered in the great market turmoil in the first few weeks of this year. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has gained 1%, and the French CAC is 0.2% higher. Investors may be concluding that the weak manufacturing data will prompt another bout of stimulus measures from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector expanded at the slowest rate in a year last month, fuelling fears that its economy is heading into trouble. The latest Purchasing Managers Index reports, based on data from thousands of firms, shows that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector only expanded modestly. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone factory PMI hit a 12-month low of 51.2, down from 52.3 in January, dragged down by weakness in the two largest euro economies. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that:\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Slower growth of production, new orders, export business and employment France and Germany hover close to stagnation mark; Greece slips back into contraction Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the eurozone faces the threat of sluggish growth in 2016, or a full-blown downturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lacklustre domestic demand is being compounded by a worsening global picture. Exports either fell or rose more slowly in all countries surveyed with the sole exception of Austria. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a region in desperate need of lower unemployment, the near-stalling of jobs growth in the manufacturing sector comes as disappointing news. Firms are cutting back on their hiring due to worries about the outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices are meanwhile being dropped as firms endeavour to boost sales, suggesting deflationary pressures have intensified. Input prices are falling at a rate not seen since July 2009. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With all indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from output and demand to employment and prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c turning down, the survey will add pressure on the ECB to act quickly and aggressively to avert another economic downturn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Growth in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has ground to a near-halt, according to Markit. The German manufacturing PMI slowed sharply to 50.5, a 15-month low, from 52.3 in January. New orders, and new exports, both dipped to the slowest growth since last summer. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers remained in near-stagnation last month. The French PMI came in at 50.2, up from 50.0 in January - which showed no growth at all. Companies interviewed by Markit reported a drop in new business, and deflationary pressures. Markit economist Jack Kennedy says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Falling new orders were again the source of weakness, leading firms to cut production levels slightly. Meanwhile, the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price indices point to continued downward pressure on already low inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy a great February. The Italian manufacturing PMI has fallen to 52.2, from 53.2 in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading in a year, signalling that growth last month. New orders also rose at the slowest pace since February 2015. The first European PMI reports are out. The Dutch manufacturing sector has reported its slowest growth in 18 months, with the PMI dropping to 51.7 from 52.4. And Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI has dipped to 54.1, from 55.4. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid growth rate, and is the 27th month of expansion in a row. Chinese investors have taken today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak factory data in their stride. The Shanghai composite index closed 1.7% higher, on hopes that Beijing will heed calls for more stimulus measures. Back to China....and Beijing is reportedly planning to cut up to six million workers from failing companies. The sackings are part of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to clear out its economy and remove excess capacity. Reuters has the story: China aims to lay off 5-6 million workers from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zombie enterprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution, two sources with ties to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership said. Beijing is trying to rejuvenate its flagging economy by streamlining bloated industrial sectors, starting with coal and steel, but layoffs have emerged as one of the biggest concerns for cash-strapped regions ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual session of parliament. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to lay off five million workers in industries suffering from a supply glut would be the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boldest retrenchment programme in almost two decades, one source said. The restructuring of state-owned enterprises from 1998 to 2003 led to around 28 million redundancies and cost the central government about 73.1 billion yuan ($11.2 billion) in resettlement funds. A second source with leadership ties put the number of layoffs at six million. Both sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media about the politically sensitive subject for fear of sparking social unrest. Few things get our blood pumping faster than a takeover battle. And we might have one brewing, over the London Stock Exchange. Shares in the LSE have soared by 8% in early trading, after rival US operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) said it was considering a bid for the LSE. That would put ICE, which owns the New York stock exchagne, toe-to-toe against Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse, which announced plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmerger of equals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the LSE last week. ICE has released a statement, confirming it is considering a bid for the LSE, which was enough to get the shares motoring: Shares in Barclays have shed 4% at the start of trading, as traders give their verdict to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. The bank is briefing reporters now: Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector continued to deteriorate last month. The Russian manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 in February, down from 49.8 in January, showing a sharper slowdown. Data firm Markit warned that Russian factories cut jobs again, as Western sanctions and the oil price slump drives the economy towards recession: Disappointingly for goods producers, scrutinising the survey data leaves little encouraging news. Workforce numbers continued to slide while outstanding business was depleted at a sharp pace. Barclays has hit investors with some bad news. The bank is more than halving its dividend, from 6.5p to 3p, after suffering and 8% drop in pre-tax profits. Jill Treanor reports: Chief executive Jes Staley, making his first announcement since taking the helm in December, said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153announcing initiatives to accelerate our strategy and simplify the group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as profits fell 8% to \u00c2\u00a32.1bn in 2015. Staley said the bank would reduce its stake in its African business - which expanded in 2005 when it bought South African bank Absa - and reduce its payout to shareholders. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Hyde reckons traders won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be impressed. Dr. He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report shows that Beijing needs to take more action, fast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI for February is 48, down 0.4 points from the previous month. The index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signalled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s road to stability remains bumpy. The government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr Gerard Lyons, economics advisor to London Mayor Boris Johnson, says it shows why the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China eased monetary policy yesterday (by allowing banks to hold less funds in reserve): Chris Weston of IG agrees that the Chinese economy is getting worse: Chinese PMIs were predictably weak and while no doubt affected by the seasonal disruptions of Chinese Lunar New Year (LNY), the trend of late was pointing to further weakness in any case. In the NBS Manufacturing PMI, the key components of output and new orders both wilted dramatically. Probably of most concern was the renewed collapse in the small companies component, which contracted to 44.4. This emphasises the fact that despite the huge growth in credit in January, most of it is going to the large state-connected corporates while small and medium sized private enterprises continue to struggle. Confusingly, China actually has two PMI reports -- the Caixin one which is so gloomy this month, and a separate survey conducted by the government. And that official PMI confirms that the factory sector shrank last month: The Financial Times has the details: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index fell to 49 in February from 49.8 in January, equalling its weakest since February 2009 and the seventh straight month of decline. The National Bureau of Statistics, which released the measure, said this was partly due to seasonal effects of the lunar new year holiday, when many factories shut down for extended periods to allow workers to travel to distant hometowns to spend time with their families. The official services sector PMI, which had previously held up better than the manufacturing index in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown, also slipped last month to 52.7, its weakest level since December 2008. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has suffered another jolt, with its manufacturing sector shrinking at a faster pace and cutting jobs at the fastest rate since the depths of the financial crisis. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad start to PMI Day, painting a pretty grim picture of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy. Data firm Caixin reports that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector contracted at the fastest pace in five months. Its Purchasing Managers Index, based on data from hundreds of companies, fell to 48.0 in February, down from 48.4 in January. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, so this shows that the operating conditions faced by Chinese goods producers continued to deteriorate in February. Output and total new orders shrank at a faster rate, and companies slashed staff at the fastest pace since January 2009 -- shortly after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It highlights that Chinese policymakers are still battling against a hard landing, with serious implications for the global economy too. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for economic data, which should give new clues into the health of the world economy. A string of new Purchasing Managers Index surveys will show how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector fared in February, from Asia to Europe to the US. Analysts will be scrutinising them for signs that growth weakened last month, in the face of financial market turbulence and the slowdown in China. We get the main eurozone data between 8.15am and 9am GMT, then the UK at 9.30am, followed by the US around 3pm. The expectations aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest February manufacturing PMI numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany are expected to reinforce concerns of a gradual manufacturing slowdown, with both the German and French measures expected to show stagnation. The latest UK manufacturing PMI numbers are expected to show further weakness, down from 52.9 to 52.3, though recent sterling weakness might help on the margins. In the US we can expect to see further weakness in the latest ISM manufacturing numbers after a really soft February Chicago PMI manufacturing number yesterday. The sharp jump seen in January saw a sharp reverse to 47.6, with all major components also showing some worrying weakness. Also coming up.... New eurozone unemployment data is released at 10am GMT. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show that the jobless remained at around 10.4% in January, underlining the weak European recovery. And on the corporate front, Barclays bank, commodity trading firm Glencore and high street pasty chain Greggs are reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

A volatile oil price did not help. Early gains for the crude price reversed sharply in the wake of higher than expected US stocks. But then investors noticed the oil update also showed a fall in US production, which helped lift the crude price once more, as did talk that Saudi Arabia was negotiating a possible $10bn loan.

                "bodyText":"The rally of recent days seemed set to continue after a strong performance from Asian markets, but as the day wore on it ran out of steam. A volatile oil price did not help. Early gains for the crude price reversed sharply in the wake of higher than expected US stocks. But then investors noticed the oil update also showed a fall in US production, which helped lift the crude price once more, as did talk that Saudi Arabia was negotiating a possible $10bn loan. So after all that, the FTSE 100 was virtually unchanged but other markets in Europe ended higher but off their best levels. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 5.82 points or 0.09% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.61% to 9776.62 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.41% at 4424.89 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.08% to 18,206.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.78% at 8764.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 3.02% to 535.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 35 points or 0.2%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for a whole host of services PMI data to digest. San Francisco Federal Reserve president John Williams has dismissed concerns that the US could be heading for recession. He told a group of businessmen that domestic demand was strong enough to overcome any economic weakness abroad. He said raising interest rates was the right strategy, but emphasised that any rate hikes would be gradual. And if the Fed did need to ease policy, he would rather use tried and tested methods such as quantitative easing rather than negative interest rates. US Fed chair Janet Yellen said last month that negative rates were not off the table. As if to emphasise the volatility of the oil price and the markets generally, crude is now rallying despite the higher than expected US inventory figure. The impetus appears to be a Reuters report suggesting that oil producer Saudi Arabia has asked banks to discuss giving it an international loan that could total $10bn. Brent crude is currently up 0.79% at $37.10 a barrel, having fallen as low as $36.1 in the wake of the US stock figures. News of the big jump in US crude stocks has had a predictable effect. Brent crude, having been as high as $36.99 a barrel, is now down 1% at $36.41, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.5% to $33.86. Meanwhile stock markets have also fallen further, as investors use the excuse to take some profits from the recent rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now off 77 points or 0.46% while the FTSE 100 has fallen 48 points or 0.79%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After a positive start markets in Europe have slipped back from their intraday peaks as cautious profit taking started to creep into a market that has been on a good run of late. A slide back in oil prices appears to have been the main catalyst behind the caution now permeating into some of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more cautious trading, as US oil inventories rose sharply by over 10m barrels, reflecting a similar sharp rise in the API numbers late last night. And storing all these stocks of crude is a growing issue: The headline rise of 10.37m was the biggest weekly increase since April 2015, said the Energy Information Administration. And imports also rose sharply: Crude stocks in the US jumped by much more than forecast last week, renewing fears of oversupply at a time when producers are reluctant to reduce output. They rose by 10.37m barrels to 517.98m, compared to expectations of a rise of 3.6m. But weekly gasoline stocks fell by 1.47m barrels, rather than the forecast increase of 1.08m. Risks in the UK housing market are growing but they are not as bad as in 2014, according to Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. Reuters reports: [Cunliffe] also said the growth of the rapidly growing so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy-to-let\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rental property sector potentially poses a financial stability risk. The Bank of England has asked the government for the power to intervene in the sector, which is likely to be approved. A public consultation on the matter will continue until March 11. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risks are a bit less now than they were in 2014 but you can see the market starting to move back again,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cunliffe told a parliamentary committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is now coming back again so maybe some of those risks are becoming a little bit more prominent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More hints of slight weakness in the US economy, from the New York Institute of Supply Management index for February: A dip in the oil price has taken the shine off the global rally, with Wall Street heading lower in early trading and other markets off their best levels. Data from the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday showed crude inventories rose by 9.9m barrels last week, sending Brent down 0.7% to $36.55. Department of Energy data due out later could either confirm this trend, or reverse it, given how volatile the oil price has been in recent times. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently off 30 points or 0.18%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% lower and Nasdaq down 0.17%. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is 23 points or 0.4% lower while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is virtually flat and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has edged up 0.16%. How resilient is the eurozone to another economic downturn? Not very resilient at all, if you believe French bank Credit Suisse. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve warned that a new recession would trigger deeper political turmoil, putting the single currency under very heavy strain. Mehreen Kahn of the Telegraph has the details: In a research note titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Close to the edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, economists at French bank Credit Suisse warned the fate of monetary union hangs in the balance if Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers are unable to ward off another global slump and keep in check anti-euro populism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The viability of the euro is contingent on the current recovery,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peter Foley at Credit Suisse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the euro area were to relapse back into recession, it is not clear it would endure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Is a recession imminent? Well, the eurozone has been growing at a lacklustre 0.3% per quarter recently, so it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take must to knock it back to stagnation. The EC is more confident, though, predicting growth of 1.7% this year. City chartists are squinting at their screens, wondering if the FTSE 100 rally is about to continue or fizzle out. Apparently we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just reached an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial support level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, based on recent trading, which could signal that the market will rise. Unless it falls though this level, in which case it might keep falling. Tricky stuff, chartism... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report show that the American economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sliding into recession, says Paul Ashcroft of Capital Economics. The 214,000 increase in the ADP survey measure of private sector employment in February, up from 193,000 the month before, is another illustration (as if any more were needed) that the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rolling over. The turmoil in financial markets, which has most recently begun to fade, obviously didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop employers hiring last month. The breakdown shows that most of those gains (+208,000) were in the services sector, with construction adding +27,000. Manufacturing employment fell by 9,000. Just in: American companies took on more new workers than expected last month. ADP, the US outsourcing group, reports that 214,000 new private sector jobs were created in February, beating forecasts of 190,000. That suggests that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll, the eagerly-awaited health-check on the US labour market, might not be bad news. Economists are expecting that the NFP will rise by 195,000, leaving the jobless rate at an eight-year low of 4.9%. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away by the recent recovery in the stock markets. Anxiety about the global economy may have eased a little, helped by the prospect of another dose of stimulus from central banks. But the underlying problems still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed - from the unbalanced nature of the world economy to the debt piles built by advanced economies, and the slide towards deflation. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, the French bank, reckons this means the optimism in the markets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last. Michael Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 grumble in The Big Short is, I think, that more crooked bankers weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sent to gaol, yet his book and the film show that the problem was an excess of fools more than an excess of crooks. But what surprised me in the period after 2008, was that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic leaders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t push for debt destruction or forgiveness, but chose instead to use monetary policy to create enough inflation to deflate the debt away. In a global economy with excess supply of goods, and one where the marginal cost of supply of many services is infinitesimally small, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why we should escape disinflation any time soon. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the risk rally will be a short-lived affair. After that early surge, shares in London have been dipping back. As the lunchtime dash to the sandwich shop approaches, the FTSE 100 is now down 18 points at 6134 - partly dragged down by ITV. The other European markets are still up, though, having hit one-month highs this morning. Broadcaster ITV isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting much love from the City this morning. Its shares have fallen over 3%, despite posting a decent rise in profits this morning. It may just be profit-taking, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some anxiety about sales growth - ITV says ad revenue will be flat until the European Football hits the screens. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better morning for Virgin Money - the challenger bank that is being built from the remains of Northern Rock. It quadrupled its pre-tax profits in 2015, helped by decent demand for mortgages. But investors in Entertainment One, which owns the rights to Peppa Pig, are squealing after seeing its shares slide 12% to the bottom of the stock market fallers. It reported a 3% fall in revenues for the last nine months of 2015, dragged down by a 14% slide film revenues. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, kids! Retail sales still look strong, as Sky News explains: Retail sales were expected to show a rise of 275%, with toys up 230% and clothes 300% ahead, the company said. Canada and France are next in line for a Peppa retail launch. Markets in South East Asia and China were continuing to develop and expected to see strong growth in the next financial year. Entertainment One\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TV revenues were up 39% but film was down 14% reflecting tough market conditions, fewer film releases than the year before and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some recent title underperformance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This rather pretty chart shows that the City is bracing for the pound to be rather volatile this summer, around the EU referendum (on 23rd June) The copper price has hit a three-month high today - another signal that economic demand is picking up. Copper on the London Metal Exchange is up 1.55 per cent to $4,789 a tonne, the highest level since November. In Shanghai copper rose 2.7 per cent to 36,820 yuan a tonne (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the FT). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally highlights a surprising fact - miners have been the best-performing shares in 2016. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural resources companies are up around 5% this year, while the wider market has lost 7%. Quite a decent recovery - until you remember that some miners lost two-thirds of their value during 2015. Uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum could be hurting the UK construction industry. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: The conversations I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had with those in the industry over the past month have been largely positive and many will be surprised to see a dip in the PMI reading. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commercial construction is increasingly buoyant, while in infrastructure sentiment is also positive, in spite of a number of key projects taking longer than expected to break ground. The reality is contractors are used to such delays and are otherwise comforted by the positive rhetoric suggesting improving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure is a long-term priority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The great unknown, however, remains Brexit. Many construction firms generate the bulk of their revenues in the UK but also rely on a steady stream of skilled workers from the EU. They are therefore considering how a vote to leave the union might impact these current arrangements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This might dampen the mood a little. Growth across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has hit a 10-month low in February, due to a drop in housebuilding. Building firms interviewed by data firm Markit reported : Slowest rise in overall construction output since April 2015 Residential building work is the weakest performing category of activity Jobs growth moderates to a 21\u00e2\ufffd\u201e2 year low And that dragged Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI down to 54.2 last month, down from 55.0 in January, showing slower growth. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, says builders lost optimism last month. Aside from the pre-election slowdown last year, the latest upturn in construction output was the weakest for over-two- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Survey respondents noted that underlying business conditions remained favourable, especially in relation to commercial building and infrastructure-related work, but some clients had been hesitant to commit to new projects so far in 2016. Reflecting this, new order growth weakened again and construction firms were the least optimistic about their year-ahead growth prospects since December 2014. And this chart shows how housebuilding (blue line) slowed. Anything above 50 points indicates growth, though. Over in the Treasury, a light may be flashing away on George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because shares in Lloyds Banking Group have hit 73.8p this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just above the point where the government can sell its stake in Lloyds. Chancellor Osborne was forced to suspend his selloff of Lloyds shares to the public last month, because its share price has shrivelled below the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreak-even\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 point. But if shares cling onto today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level, the sale could soon be on again! Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9, European Central Bank board member, has dropped a clear hint that the ECB will ease monetary policy this month. Speaking in Frankfurt, C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to stimulate economic growth and push inflation up, after seeing prices fall by 0.2% in January. Some analysts are concerned that the ECB could harm the banking sector by cutting borrowing costs again - it already imposes negative rates on banks. But C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 argued that banks should accept ultra-low interest rates, as the alternative is poor economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have seen from the recent sharp fall in bank equityprices that the sector is highly sensitive to a weaker-than-expected economic outlook In that context, our commitment to our price stability mandate is vital to anchor expectations of nominal growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The global rally has also reached Istanbul, pushing Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to its highest level since the start of December. London Capital Group analyst Ipek Ozkardeskay says encouraging economic data from America is luring money back into shares. The French and German markets both up around 0.8% this morning, mirroring the rally in London. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days (!), but March is proving to be a better month for shares than January or February. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the situation: Rising a further 30 points after the bell the FTSE has already tentatively touched the 6200 mark for the first time since the end of 2015. That is a marked improvement on the barrel-scraping 3 and a half year lows seen in the middle of last month, the UK index arguably aided by the somewhat volatile, but gradually steadying, oil prices, Brent Crude slipping around a 0.5% but still hovering around the $36.50 per barrel level with the latest US crude oil inventories to come this afternoon. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, are similarly buoyant; the DAX, approaching 9800, is at its highest point since the start of February. Risk sentiment is on the up in the markets today, says Chris Weston of IG, sparked by the strong rally on Wall Street last night. Weston identifies several technical reasons behind the optimism: The Bloomberg US financial conditions index is about to turn accommodative for the first time in 2016. Bloomberg incorporates the S&amp;P 500, VIX, various credit spreads, the US dollar and money market spreads into this index. This will fill the Federal Reserve with confidence. VIX measures volatility in the markets, and is known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index. Credit spreads show the difference between the yield on risky and less risky assets - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve narrowed recently, which means a greater appetite for danger. The London stock market has hit its highest level since New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve 2015, as the global rally reaches Europe. In early trading, the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has gained 39 points to 6192, following those strong gains in Asia overnight. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been this high since 31 December, when the blue-chip index closed at 6,242 points. Mining shares are leading the rally, with copper producer Antofagasta up over 4%. That suggests City investors are taking heart from encouraging manufacturing data from the US yesterday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also probably betting on fresh central bank stimulus in China and the eurozone (which has just fallen back into deflation). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets believes investors are taking confidence from recent rises in commodity prices. They suggest demand for energy and metals may be picking up again, after some hefty falls last year. The continued rebound in commodity prices is all the more welcome given solvency concerns about some of the more leveraged firms in the sector. The recovery in copper, iron ore and oil prices has been a key arbiter in the rebound seen in mining and oil and gas stocks over the past few weeks, and the recent recognition by Chinese authorities that steps need to be taken to cut back on the overcapacity in the sector do appear to have also helped sentiment. Those cutbacks could see around 6 million Chinese workers laid off in the next couple of years. Switzerland has also smashed growth forecasts this morning. Swiss GDP rose by 0.4% in the October-December quarter, compared to forecasts of just 0.1%. It shows Switzerland did better than expected after the shock of January 2015, when it broke its currency peg and allowed the Swiss franc to soar against the euro Economists had feared this would hurt exports badly and drive Switzerland into recession. But as Cornelia Luchsinger, an economist at Zuercher Kantonalbank, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A year ago no one would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve thought 2015 would wind up being as good as it was.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Australia has helped drive shares higher today, by releasing stronger-than-expected growth figures. Australian GDP rose by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2015, meaning the economy grew by 3% during the last year. That beat forecasts, suggesting that the slowdown in the commodity market has caused less grief than feared. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has posted its best day since November, despite credit rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatening to downgrade the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. The Shanghai Composite has just closed 4% higher, amid hopes that Beijing policymakers will take more steps to stimulate the economy. Shares in property developers led the surge, helped by reports that house prices in China are picking up, according to Reuters. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a rally, given Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s began the day by cutting the outlook on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from stable to negative. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances would come under strain if it was forced to take on the liabilities from troubled state-owned companies. It also questioned whether the Chinese government was really committed to economic reforms. Marie Diron, a senior vice president at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, told Bloomberg Television that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to absorb shocks has diminished and we want to signal this in the negative outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pertinent questions, given the recent capital outflows out of China which prompted the yuan to be devalued. But it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit the mood in Asia, where shares hit a two-month high. A stunning session in Asia has sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index surging by 4%. A burst of renewed confidence helped investors to drive the Tokyo market up to its highest level since 8 February. It was a broad-based rally too, with 220 of the 225 companies on the Nikkei gaining. ground. And shares across Asia hit their highest levels in two months. Anxiety about a possible global recession appear to have eased, a little, giving traders a new appetite for risk. Stefan Worrall, director of Japan equity sales at Credit Suisse, told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the selloff and the fears of recession that emerged early in the new year, people pulled back aggressively from their previous expectations about how a rate hike from the Federal Reserve might unfold, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suddenly some of this lost confidence has been restored as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a lot of recent economic data from the U.S. beating expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopes of future economic stimulus from the European Central Bank, and the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China, are also helping the mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders can leave their tin hats at home today, because shares are going up. Wall Street set the mood last night, where shares rallied after stronger-than-expected construction and manufacturing data. The Dow Jones industrial average surging by 2% - its biggest one-day move since January. And the Nasdaq posted its best day in six months. Asia has picked up the baton with a strong session, helped by decent growth figures from Australia. And European shares are going to follow, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains (which saw the FTSE 100 hit its highest levels since the start of January). After a scary start to this year, investors seem to have regained some confidence about economic prospects, financial conditions, and the slowdown in emerging markets. How long that lasts is another issue.... On the Agenda.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of economic data to look forward to, and a couple of central bank speeches too. 8:30am GMT: ECB executive board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 is speaking in Frankfurt 9:30am: The Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI will show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders fared in February 10:00am: Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent is speaking in London 1.15pm: The ADP jobs report shows how many private sector jobs were created in America last month 3.30pm: The US Department of Energy reports new Crude Oil Inventory figures And on the corporate front, the City are getting results from broadcaster ITV, transport group Stagecoach and financial group Virgin Money.",

He forecast about 1.9 percent U.S. GDP growth for this year, enough to push down the unemployment rate, now at 4.9 percent.</p> <p>But, he added, while monetary policy remains accommodative, it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd less so than it was at the beginning of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in light of tightening global financial conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-03T17:09:56.501Z\">at 5.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56d86984e4b0e3026187a24b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-03T16:42:58.522Z\">4.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the weakness in the global economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/705432860661059584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Global economic growth has sunk to the lowest since October 2012 <a href=\"https://t.co/KMjCrx1aYd\">https://t.co/KMjCrx1aYd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Jq9e9onras\">pic.twitter.com/Jq9e9onras</a></p>&mdash; Chris Williamson (@WilliamsonChris) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/705432860661059584\">March 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d8643be4b0a02aed205de8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graham-ruddick\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-03T16:21:09.530Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BHS:</p> <blockquote> <p>BHS is threatening to close up to half its shops as the cash-strapped retailer tries to negotiate a reduction in rents with its landlords.</p> <p>It is understood that BHS has told landlords it wants to close between 50 and 60 shops, and could close another 30 if landlords do not reduce the rents.</p> <p>The shop closures would put hundreds of jobs at risk if BHS presses ahead with its threat.</p> <p>An announcement is expected from the company about its plans within days.

There is a somewhat suspicious uniform attack on high denomination bills of global currencies.</p> <p>Noted economists such as Larry Summers; respected journalists such as the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gillian Tett, central bankers such as Mario Draghi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all seem suddenly concerned that 500 euro or 10,000 yen Notes are facilitating drug dealers and terrorists (which they are).

                "bodyText":"Weaker service sector data from around the globe has left stock markets flagging, despite a fairly stable performance from the oil price (Brent crude is currently down just 0.14% at $36.88 a barrel). From China to the US, service sector companies have reported a slowdown, prompting investors to cash in some of their gains from the recent rally. But there was no panic selling unlike earlier in the year, and the movements were fairly restrained. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 16.6 points or 0.27% at 6130.46 although around 13 points of the fall can be attributed to a number of companies going ex-dividend Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.25% to 9751.92 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.2% at 4416.08 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.78% to 18,348.50 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.03% to 8767.0 In Greece, the Athens market rose 2.91% to 551.36 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.36%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest US non-farm payroll numbers. The US central bank should be patient on raising rates, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan has said. The economic data out today has shown continuing weakness, calling into doubt the idea of a number of rate rises this year after the Fed lifted the cost of borrowing in December. Reuters reports on Kaplan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech today: Global factors like the drop in stock markets, the decline in the price of oil, and the rise in the dollar since the beginning of the year are acting like a brake on the U.S. economic recovery, similar to the effect of an interest-rate increase, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I believe that excessive accommodation carries a cost in terms of distortions and imbalances in hiring, asset allocation and investment decisions, I also believe that, at this juncture, the Fed needs to show patience in decisions to remove accommodation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kaplan said in remarks prepared for delivery in Austin. The Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, and at the time policymakers indicated they thought they would like raise rates four more times over the course of the year... Kaplan said he expects the U.S. economy to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resilient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year, with consumer spending buoyed by lower gas prices, among other factors. He forecast about 1.9 percent U.S. GDP growth for this year, enough to push down the unemployment rate, now at 4.9 percent. But, he added, while monetary policy remains accommodative, it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd less so than it was at the beginning of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in light of tightening global financial conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back with the weakness in the global economy: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BHS: BHS is threatening to close up to half its shops as the cash-strapped retailer tries to negotiate a reduction in rents with its landlords. It is understood that BHS has told landlords it wants to close between 50 and 60 shops, and could close another 30 if landlords do not reduce the rents. The shop closures would put hundreds of jobs at risk if BHS presses ahead with its threat. An announcement is expected from the company about its plans within days. It is likely that BHS will use a company voluntary arrangement, a type of insolvency proceeding, to close the shops. The retailer is being advised by KPMG, the accountancy firm, and they have been in discussions with landlords for several weeks about how to cut the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rent bill. Full story here: Breaking news on UK retailer BHS: And in the search for havens amid the market volatility: Meanwhile UK chancellor George Osborne and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble have been talking about Brexit at the British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: The day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US data has been uniformly poor. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Posting its first contraction since October 2013 the Markit services PMI managed to underperform the already low-bar set by the flash reading, coming in at 49.7 against the 49.8 expected; soon after the ISM non-manufacturing figure slipped month-on-month from 53.5 to 53.4 (admittedly, slightly higher than forecast) with factory orders rising back to 1.6% from -2.9% but crucially failing to match the 2.1% expected. Add onto that the worst jobless claims figure for around 4 weeks and significant miss in the non-farm productivity number, and the Fed was dealt another dovish blow ahead of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in a fortnight; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see if the all-important non-farm jobs report adds to that sentiment tomorrow afternoon, with an improvement in the employment change figure (still expected below 200,000) set to be countered by a wage growth tumble. Regardless there was little reason to cheer for the Dow, even with the prospect of no rate hike in the immediate future. And there are some unwanted records: The weak services data shows the US Federal Reserve was too hasty in raising interest rates in December, says David Morrison at Spread Co: The ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI slipped at touch from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading while Factory Orders came in shy of the consensus expectation. This means that both the services and manufacturing sides of the US economy are showing signs of distress. This provides a good reason for the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC to row back from its December projection of a full 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. However, it also suggests that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike at the end of last year is proving to be a big policy error. Nevertheless, investors are unlikely to overreact to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-important Non-Farm Payrolls. More confirmation of weakness in the US services sector, and indeed the US economy. The ISM non-manufacturing index dipped from 53.5 in January to 53.4 last month, although this was slightly higher than the 53.2 figure which had been forecast. The new orders index at 55.5, down from 56.5, is the lowest since March 2014. Recent US economic data has suggested the Federal Reserve may struggle to justify raising interest rates again in the near future. The Markit survey shows a stagnating US economy and there may be worse to come, said the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Chris Williamson: Business activity stagnated in February as malaise spread from the manufacturing sector to services. The Markit PMIs are signalling a stagnation of the economy in February, suggesting growth has deteriorated further since late last year. Prices pressures are waning again in line with faltering demand. Average prices charged for goods and services are dropping once again, down for the first time in five months, as firms compete to win new business Worse may be to come, as inflows of new business have slowed sharply, causing backlogs of work across both sectors to fall at the fastest rate seen since the 2008-9 financial crisis. Such weak demand suggests that business activity and price discounting look set to continue. However, perhaps the brightest warning light is the downturn in business optimism to the joint-lowest recorded by the survey, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for trouble ahead. The Markit services PMI is out and contrary to expectations, it has slipped back. The final reading for February has come in at 49.7, down from the initial reading of 49.8 and January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 53.2. This is the first contraction since since October 2013. US markets have slipped back in early trading, as oil prices edge lower once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 26 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.10% and Nasdaq dipped 0.12%. Brent crude is 0.97% lower at $36.57 a barrel on continuing concerns over a glut of supply and falling demand. Earlier US weekly jobless claims rose to a higher than expected 278,000 from 272,000 the previous week, and higher than the 271,000 forecast. Due shortly are the US service sector figures for February. As with manufacturing there are two rival indices, from Markit and ISM. And as with manufacturing, they may not necessarily be in tandem. Analysts expect the Markit services PMI to edge up from an initial reading of 49.8 for February to 50, but down on the January figure. The ISM non-manufacturing index is forecast to slip from 53.5p to 53. Influential bond trader Bill Gross has launched a scorching attack on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers for driving interest rates into record low territories. In his latest note to clients at Janus Capital, Gross warned that the credit growth that has fuelled the economy for so long could soon fizzle out, much as the sun will (eventually) run dry of hydrogen. Sounding more like a campaigner for financial reform than a Wall Street titan, Gross wrote: Capitalistic initiative married to an ever expanding supply of available credit has facilitated economic prosperity much like the Sun has been the supply center for energy/ food and life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sustenance. But now with quantitative easing and negative interest rates, the concept of nurturing credit seems to have morphed into something destructive as opposed to growth enhancing. Our global, credit based economic system appears to be in the process of devolving from a production oriented model to one which recycles finance for the benefit of financiers. Making money on money seems to be the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flickering objective. Our global financed-based economy is becoming increasingly dormant, not because people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work or technology isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t producing better things, but because finance itself is burning out like our future Sun. Gross also took aim at the push into negative interest rates, calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a Zika-like contagion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has spread from the eurozone to Japan. Stay classy, Bill. And he even touched on speculation that authorities might even abolish cash, to allow rates to be slashed even lower. As Gross puts it: Central bankers seem ever intent on going lower, ignorant in my view of the harm being done to a classical economic model that has driven prosperity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until it reached a negative interest rate dead end and could drive no more. In addition, government policymakers seem to be setting up future roadblocks for savers. There is a somewhat suspicious uniform attack on high denomination bills of global currencies. Noted economists such as Larry Summers; respected journalists such as the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gillian Tett, central bankers such as Mario Draghi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all seem suddenly concerned that 500 euro or 10,000 yen Notes are facilitating drug dealers and terrorists (which they are). But what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an economist/central banker doing opining on law enforcement? It appears that the one remaining escape hatch for ordinary citizens is being closed. Money in a mattress will heretofore be associated with drugs/terror. The cashless society which appears over the horizon may come sooner than the demise of the penny! More here: Sunshine, Lollipops and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a double dose of Brazilian gloom! Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector contracted at a record pace last month, suggesting that the slump recorded in 2015 extended int0 2016. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brazil Composite Output Index, which tracks companies across the economy, dropped to 39.0 in February, the lowest figure since the survey began in 2007. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the 12th month running that the index has fallen below the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Brazilian companies reported that business activity, new orders and employment all fell sharply last month.\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, says the picture in Brazil is pretty grim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Brazilian economic downturn took a real turn for the worse in February, as the financial and political difficulties in the country drove down output and led to reduced order intakes. The domestic market is especially weak and this hit service providers hard, with activity and new business in this sector falling at survey record rates. The labour market also appears to be in dire straits, as manufacturers and service providers reported further substantial reductions to headcounts. Back to the UK....and JP Morgan has pushed back its forecast for the first UK interest rate rise, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector slowdown. They now think the Bank of England will leave borrowing costs at record lows for another year, and only hike in the first quarter of 2017. Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has suffered its worst 12 months in 25 years. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank by 3.8% during 2015, new data show, dragged down by the commodity crunch and a deepening political corruption scandal. Stats body IBGE also reported that GDP in the final three months of 2015 was 1.8% lower than in the third quarter. That rounded off a pretty brutal year for Brazil, as this chart from the FT shows: The slump in the prices for iron ore, copper and oil has hurt Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural resource companies, forcing them to shed workers. But the problems in Brazil run much deeper, with the political class engulfed by allegations of wrong-doing. President Dilma Rousseff is fighting efforts to impeach her over charges that she used money from state-run banks to plug holes in the budget. That case is making it harder for Rousseff to tackle Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances, as hefty spending cuts or tax rises could alienate her supporters. And while growth withers, inflation is running at 11% - despite the central bank keeping interest rates at around 14%. In other news, business secretary Sajid Javid has announced that statutory regulators will be forced to take into account the cost of investigations into possible misconduct. He announced the plan at the British Chambers of Commerce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference, pitching it as part of a government clampdown on the broader costs of regulation on business. Javid said the new requirement on regulators would help save \u00c2\u00a310bn from cutting red tape, in addition to the \u00c2\u00a310bn saved by the previous government between 2010 and 2015. But it sounds like an alarming development, especially for financial regulators, who will be under pressure to delay tackling or even ignore claims of misselling. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, launched a stinging attack on foreign digital businesses that successfully avoid paying corporation tax. He said it was an obligation for companies that earn revenues in the UK to pay tax in the UK. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a lot of discussion about the EU referendum at the BCC event, including an appearance by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble. Our Politics Live operation is covering it all, here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some pessimism from Royal Bank of Scotland, who have crunched the manufacturing data released on Tuesday: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some optimism from Kallum Pickering, economist at Berenberg Bank, who reckons the threats hitting the UK economy are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransitory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: The real problem for the UK is not fundamentals. In fact, a broad range of indicators point to sustained healthy growth in domestic demand; low unemployment, cheap oil, low interest rates and moderate real wage growth. The real problem is that risks appear to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall or nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Since Autumn of last year the global economy has delivered a treadmill of threats; China slowdown, EM crisis and the EU migrant problem, to name but a few. And in 2016 they have intensified. First, the financial market rout and overstated fears of a global recession hit confidence in January. Then, before consumers and businesses could find their feet again, the date of the EU referendum (June 23) was announced, bringing the reality of a Brexit to the fore. But on the upside, global risks are mostly overstated and are beginning to gradually ease and a Brexit is not our central view. We give a 35% likelihood that the UK votes to leave the EU. In a battle between consistent economic fundamentals and transitory risks (no matter how threatening) the former usually seizes the day, especially in the context of low inflation and dovish central banks. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector report follows disappointing data from the manufacturing sector on Tuesday, which showed growth at a 34-month low. Construction firms also had a weak February, as this chart shows: Economists are split over whether the Bank of England will slash interest rates to fresh record lows, in response to these signs of economic slowdown. Independent economist Shaun Richards reckons at least one policymaker will vote for a cut: Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics reckons the BoE will hold its nerve, though. He points to recent falls in sterling (which should push up inflation and help exporters), and the strong jobs market. The service sector slowdown is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchammer blow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He predicts a sharp slowdown in the current quarter, compared with the 0.5% growth recorded in October-December. We have pencilled in growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, but there look to be downside risks to this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as heightened uncertainty over the EU membership referendum could well foster increasing business and consumer caution. This is uncomfortable news for George Osborne as he readies his March budget. The UK service sector makes up around 70% of the economy, so the scale of the slowdown in February is quite worrying. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, flags up that many firms are too nervous to expand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Momentum in services is slowing with everything from Chinese growth concerns, low oil prices, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on EU membership and global market volatility all increasing the level of uncertainty that businesses are feeling. These doubts have meant that less than 50% of survey respondents expect their businesses to expand in the next 12 months although only 8% expect a contraction; there are simply too many all-encompassing questions that need answering for businesses to feel that they have a solid foundation to grow. So, for now, expect the engine of UK economic performance to tread water, at best.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK service sector report is much weaker than expected, says financial newswire RANsquawk. Brexit fears mean British companies have little to be optimistic about right now, according to David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A maelstrom of sluggish global economic performance and relatively subdued business confidence resulted in a downbeat message in February. The combined pressures from uncertainties around the EU referendum, China and Middle East crowded out any strong optimism for the future. BREAKING: UK service sector growth has hit its weakest level in three years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector PMI, which tracks activity at hundreds of British firms, has fallen sharply to 52.7 in February, from 55.6 in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading since March 2013 (anything over 50 = growth). UK service providers said they have suffered a big drop in new order growth. Some blamed rising levels of global economic uncertainty, including the EU referendum, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown, and the crisis in the Middle East. Employment growth hit a two-and a half-year low, suggesting bosses are nervous about taking on more staff. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson singles out the upcoming vote on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union. Survey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad. Williamson added that the slowdown puts more pressure on the UK central bank to take fresh action:\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The extent of the slowdown will be a shock to policymakers and surely puts to bed any talk of the Bank of England raising interest rates. The focus will instead increasingly shift to whether policymakers may soon need to dig deeper into their toolbox to introduce new measures to shore up the economy with additional stimulus, and what tools might be used. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI reports confirm that the eurozone recovery has been faltering for a few months now: The slowdown across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has worsened. Data firm Markit has found that growth decelerated to its weakest rate in 13 months, dragged back by France (not for the first time). Its monthly PMI report found evidence of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a broad-based slowdown of the eurozone private sector economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Growth slowed in Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland, while France fell back into contraction for the first time in 13 months. Firms reported that output growth, and new business, both grew at a slower rate, indicating that demand fell. And they also cut prices again, adding to the threat of deflation that is stalking the eurozone. This meant that Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Final Eurozone Composite Output Index dropped to 53.0, down from 53.6 in January.\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Chris Williamson, their chief economist, warns that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate may be falling towards stagnation, dragged down by its second largest member.\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The survey data raise the prospect of economic growth deteriorating further from the already meagre pace seen late last year, when GDP rose only 0.3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany and Italy both reported the smallest expansions for five months, while Spain recorded the worst growth for 14 months. It was France, however, that remained the weakest link, seeing business activity fall for the first time in just over a year. The economic chasm between Germany and France has widened, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing manager reports. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector PMI fell to 49.3 in February, showing that activity shrank last month - at the fastest pace in over a year. But over in Germany, service sector firms kept growing, pushing the PMI further above the 50-point mark showing expansion. Satellite firm Inmarsat is the biggest faller in London this morning. It warned that trading may be tough this year due to weak government spending; a reminder that fiscal cutbacks have a nasty habit of hitting the private sector. Whitbread is close behind too, after disappointing the City by only reporting sales growth of 0.5% in the last quarter. It blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower footfall on the high street and an unusually warm winter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which apparently meant less demand for hot drinks (?!) A weak start to trading in London has sent the FTSE 100 down by 17 points to 6129. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx reckons the weak Chinese data has hit sentiment: Kicking off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dump with a whimper was China, Caixin reporting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak and unstable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the latest PMI slipped to 51.2. Of course this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped the markets regain the confidence that was so rampant on the first day of the month, a reminder of the Chinese slowdown the last thing anyone needs to hear when they wake up for a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. After five months of contraction, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has finally returned to growth. Firms reported that they won new orders at the fastest pace since last July. And that pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia Services Business Activity Index up to 50.9, up from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 47.1, showing a small expansion. But Western sanctions and the slump in the oil price are still hurting Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, forcing companies to keep shedding staff. Markit explains:\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Faced with a lower level of incomplete work, Russian service sector firms continued to shed jobs. Moreover, workforce numbers have declined in every survey for the past two years. There was some evidence that lower employee numbers were associated with efforts to cut back on costs. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice central bank governor has pledged to maintain a prudent approach to monetary policy this year, rather than shocking the markets with another yuan devaluation. Reuters has the details: Yi Gang said the central bank would keep the yuan basically stable against a basket of currencies this year. The weak service sector report comes as thousands of Chinese officials travel to Beijing for the National People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Congress. The NPC is a rare chance to hear from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top leadership, as they plot their strategy to rebalance the economy towards consumerism. Bloomberg dubs it \u00e2\u20ac\u015310 days of parliamentary pageantry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that: This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting will focus on crafting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development plan for the next five years. And the proceedings may provide crucial details on how the government plans to control a slow down in growth while avoiding the dreaded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middle-income trap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese policymakers have been given a new warning that their economy is weakening. Growth in the Chinese service sector slowed in February, according to a new report from data provider Caixin. Chinese service sector firms told Caixin that activity and new orders both grew at a slower rate - meaning they also cut back on job creation. This follows weak factory data earlier this week, and indicates that activity across the Chinese private sector actually shrank last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new survey of the Chinese economy. Services business activity growth slows as manufacturers report further fall in output Composite employment falls at quickest rate in six months, as service sector job creation weakens and manufacturers cut staff numbers sharply Input costs increase at the composite level for the first time in a year-and-a-half And that dragged Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China General Services Business Activity Index down to 51.2, from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-month high of 52.4. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. Add in the weak manufacturing sector, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMI fell to 49.4, showing contraction. Dr. He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group says it underlines the need for fresh action from Beijing. The Caixin Composite Output Index for February came in at 49.4, dipping below 50 again, indicating the economy is still weak and unstable. Overall, the services sector has outperformed manufacturing industries, reflecting continued improvement in the economic structure. While implementing measures to stabilize economic growth, the government needs to push forward reform on the supply side in the services sector to release its potential.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big day for economic data, as we look for signs that the world economy is fighting off the risk of a new downturn. The service sector is in the spotlight today, with surveys from across the globe showing whether activity, exports and hiring picked up or slowed down in February. That includes: 9am GMT: The eurozone 9.30am: the UK 3pm: the US Given the size of the services economy, this should show whether fears of a new recession are overblown, or if the recent financial turmoil has hit confidence. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: While there is no question that the global manufacturing sector continues to find its growth prospects somewhat difficult, the recent rebounds in commodity prices has raised the hope that we could well see a similar rebound in economic activity in the coming months. In that time, concerns about a ripple out effect to the services sector do appear to have been contained, but there is still a worry that the slowdown in the services sector could last a little bit longer than many expect. We also get two health checks on the UK housing market, with figures from Nationwide and Halifax building societies. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of corporate results around too. In the UK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing from hotels-to-coffee chain Whitbread, pizza chain Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and challenger bank Shawbrook, while German sportswear giant Adidas is also releasing numbers. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep an eye on Spain, where opposition leader Pedro S\u00c3\u00a1nchez failed to be backed by enough MPs to become prime minister. Another vote is scheduled for Friday. If S\u00c3\u00a1nchez can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get sufficient backing, then it could be fresh election times in Spain, adding another dose of political risk to Europe....",

                "bodyText":"In a late development, President Obama has just spoken to reporters after a meeting with his economic team. Obama declared that the US is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty darn great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right now -- a rebuttal at Donald Trump and his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make America Great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd campaign. Our economy is the envy of the world, he claimed. And the president was adamant that his policies had worked, delivering 72 months of jobs growth. The priority is to continue that recovery, giving people better jobs and higher salaries, and making the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grow even faster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later with the Wall Street close.... A new burst of market optimism has driven shares in London to their highest closing level since the start of 2016. Mining stocks drove the market higher, helped by the sight of copper and iron ore prices touching their highest levels since last autumn. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scared the horses either, even though the poor wage growth took the shine off a decent rise in employment. The FTSE 100 has closed for the night, and the week, up 69 points or 1.1% at 6,199. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest close since New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve. The Footsie has now surged by 12% since mid-February, when shares hit their lowest level since 2012 amid fears of a new banking crisis and a global recession. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sums up the situation: Shares in Europe added to early gains after the US employment report eased concerns of a slowdown in the US economy without increasing chances of a faster pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Major averages in both the US and Europe are on track for a third successive week of gains. The strength in equities is largely thanks to oil prices being back close to where they started the year but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains were reinforced by the biggest rise in the fix for the Chinese yuan in three weeks. The stabilisation of the Chinese currency as well as efforts this week by authorities in China to bring down excess capacity in its commodities industries helped miners lead gains on the FTSE 100. Anglo American led the UK index with near double-digit daily gains in hot pursuit from sector-peers BHP Billiton, Glencore and Antofagasta as industrial and precious metals benefitted from a slide in the US dollar. The stock markets are pushing higher, as investors dash to buy shares before the European close in 15 minutes time. Wall Street is now in positive territory, and the FTSE 100 is up 68 points at 6,200, again of 1.1%. Mining stocks continue to lead the rally, amid chatter that the commodity crunch has hit a bottom. Bloomberg News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Matt Boes has been truffling through the Jobs Report. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spotted that unemployment among America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hispanic workers fell sharply last month. And the rate of retirements across the labor market dipped a little too. Jason Furman, who chairs president Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, insists that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very good report\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The fall in the underemployment rate, and the rise in the participation rate, show that the labor market continued to improve, argues Furman on Bloomberg TV. But what about the 0.1% fall in wages in February? Furman agrees that wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough. However, January saw unusually high wage growth of 0.5%. On average, the last two months showed wages growing faster than inflation, he says. The drop in average earnings has tainted an otherwise solid US jobs report, says David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading platform XTB.com. Overall the report paints a fairly strong picture of continued strength in the US labour market with the 4-month moving average remaining firmly above the 200k mark and the unemployment rate of 4.9% remains near its lowest level in a decade. The first contraction in average hourly earnings since January last year came as an unexpected shock, although having said that there remains little evidence here of any real weakness in the labour market that would be prohibitive for Fed rate hikes in the not too distant future.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The financial markets are not particularly impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. Wall Street has just opened, and the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 13 points or 0.08% to 16,931. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 0.3% Markets are still up in Europe, though, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,163 points - close to its highest levels this year. Despite a month-on-month fall in wages, overall today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report bodes well for consumption, says Nina Skero, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Strong job creation will make consumers both more able and, via boosted consumer confidence, more willing to spend. A healthy consumer spending outlook is especially important for the US economy as the country faces challenges on other economic fronts. CEBR agrees that the Fed could raise interest rates again soon -- something Skero calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwarranted and premature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They also sent over this chart, showing the steady recovery in the US labor market since 2010. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, is quite upbeat about the Non-Farm Payroll. He reckons it has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shaken off the doubters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who thought the US economy was weakening. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report is a mixed bag, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. But on balance, he thinks it could tee-up a Federal Reserve rate hike this summer: Overall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that labour market conditions are still strong. The lack of a more marked pick-up in wage growth is the only missing element. But as far as the Fed is concerned, it is already seeing a clear acceleration in core price inflation, so it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delay raising interest rates for much longer. A June rate hike is coming. Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has a cunning theory to explain the surprise dip in earnings (from $25.38 per hour to $25.35). He thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all in the timing. Workers who are paid every fortnight would have received their second wage payment on 15th February, three days AFTER the Non-Farm Payroll survey took place. Shepherdson says: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken in by the dip in hourly earnings; it just continues a very consistent pattern of undershooting in months when the 15th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c payday for people paid semi-monthly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c falls after the employment survey week. Same thing in March, but then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a huge rebound, putting year-on-year wage growth at new highs. This tweet suggests he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right: Financial commentators agree that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll report shows solid job creation, but lacklustre wage growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Most of the jobs created in America last month were in healthcare, retail, and in bars and restaurants. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown Health care and social assistance: +57,000 jobs. Retail trade: +55,000. Food services and drinking places: +40,000 jobs. Private educational services: +28,000 Construction: +19,000, Mining: lost -19,000 jobs The BLS adds that: Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.5%), adult women (4.5%), teenagers (15.6%), Whites (4.3%), Blacks (8.8%), Asians (3.8%), and Hispanics (5.4%) showed little or no change in February. More Americans are returning to the jobs market. The labor force participation rate rose to 62.9% from 62.7% in February. That means more people are either in work, or looking. That could explain why wage growth is disappointing -- employers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to offer large pay rises if there is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcslack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the jobs market. Alan Krueger, Princeton economics professor, says the fall in earnings last month is a blow. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a pickup in wages....This report, behind the headline jobs number, is disappointing. Put the confetti away. Although job creation was strong, wage growth was not. Average earnings of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private workers FELL by 0.1% during February, reversing the 0.5% rise seen in January. That means wages are only 2.2% higher than a year ago. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report says: In February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 3 cents to $25.35, following an increase of 12 cents in January. Average hourly earnings have risen by 2.2 percent over the year. Job creation was quite broad-based last month. The Bureau for Labour Statistics says: Employment gains occurred in health care and social assistance, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and private educational services, Job losses continued in mining. The US unemployment rate remains at an eight-year low of 4.9%. Here we go! The US economy created 242,000 new jobs last month -- a better performance than expected. That beats market expectations for 195,00 new jobs And January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure have been revised higher too, to show that 172,000 new hires (up from 151k originally). More to follow... Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, reckons Wall Street will be most interested in the earnings figures: We expect markets to concentrate on wage growth rather than non-farm payrolls. It is, after all, inflation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key metric for the Fed right now. The waiting is nearly over. In 30 minute time, the latest US jobs report will hit the tape and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment market performed last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what to watch for: 1) How many new jobs were created in February. The consensus is for a 195,000 increase in the Non-Farm Payroll, up from a disappointing 151,000 in January. As usual, Wall Street estimates vary quite widely, from 165k to 220k. Some observers are more pessimistic though, such: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a chance that January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will be revised. 2) Where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wage growth? We got a surprisingly strong 0.5% pick-up in earnings growth last month, suggesting that the recovery was reaching workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pockets 3) Has the unemployment rate come down again? It hit an eight-year low of 4.9% in January, which should have reassured the Federal Reserve over its December rate hike. 4) But what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the deeper picture? The labor force participation rate has been close to its lowest in decades, showing that many Americans simply stopped looking for work. Underemployment is another key measure; the report will show how many people wanted to work more hours. Arnaud Masset, analyst at Swiss online bank Swissquote, says the Payroll will shed light on whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy risks recession this year. Even the most hawkish Fed members have stopped giving overly optimistic speeches, instead becoming more cautious about the US outlook. More and more market participants are wondering if the US economy is on the edge of a recession or whether this is just a temporary setback (apparently the temporary setback has become seasonal since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). In our opinion, it is still too early to ring alarm bells.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Demand for Brazilian assets is surging today, after former president Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva was detained by police. Lula was dragged into the long-running corruption scandal that has gripped Brazil for months, when federal officers raided his house early this morning. Our Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts explains why the move is so important: The detention of the influential Workers party politician \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who is best known by his nickname Lula \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marks a dramatic new phase of the Lava Jato (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153carwash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) probe into bribery and kickback allegations involving the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading companies and dozens of congressmen. It is likely to further add to the pressure on the government of president Dilma Rousseff, who is already struggling with an impeachment challenge, economic recession and the Zika epidemic. More here: Brazilian police detain former president Lula in corruption inquiry Investors are piling into Brazilian assets, anticipating political change. Brazil is currently suffering a deep recession, and rampant inflation. The Brazilian real has already surged by over 2% against the US dollar, from 3.8 against the $1 to 3.7. The stock market is tipped to leap by 6% when trading begins. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of optimism is also pushing copper to its highest level since mid-November, as Reuters reports: Copper prices rose to their highest in nearly four months on Friday, boosted by optimism about demand prospects and output cuts that will help the market move towards balance. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 1% at $4,905 a tonne at 1048 GMT, on course for its largest weekly gain since September last year. Copper earlier touched $4,933 a tonne, its highest since November 12. Iron ore has hit its highest level since last October this morning, continuing a recent rally. Iron ore is benefitting from reports that China is cutting its steel sector and laying off millions of workers, in an attempt to cut oversupply. But traders should be cautious, given iron ore demand is so closely linked to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth. Trimming supply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee demand for steel, as the Wall Street Journal warned this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car figures: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bleak morning for workers at troubled UK high street chain BHS. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners are planning to cut 350 jobs, and is also threatening to close half its stores unless landlords cut the rent. The job cuts come a day after BHS filed for insolvency protection, as we reported yesterday. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the story: The retailer intends to make 220 people redundant in stores and 150 people in head office. Another 100 roles that had not been filled in BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head office in recent months will also be scrapped, meaning its central operations will shrink by roughy a third. BHS bosses briefed staff about the job losses and the turnaround plan on Friday morning. As well as the job cuts, BHS is threatening to close up to half its stores if landlords do not agree to reduce the rents. BHS has filed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding, in an attempt to cut its costs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The FTSE 100 is on track to close at a new 2016 high, although the US jobs report could yet change that. After three hours of trading, the blue chip index is up a steady 0.5% at 6161 points. Most other European indices are higher too, following Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead overnight, meaning global markets are still at a two-month high. Ryan Myerberg, a portfolio manager at Janus Capital, says optimism has come pouring back into the markets recently. He says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworld is going to end\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 story, but the way the mood has changed in the last couple of weeks is just crazy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Since the beginning of the year it has been like driving down the motorway where every couple of miles a tractor has overturned, whether that be China, oil, the banks, that you have to swerve around.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And this tweet shows how some emerging markets have led the rally in 2016, after a couple of challenging years. Money has been pouring back into gold this morning, driving the price of billion up to a 13-month high. Gold just hit $1274.50 an ounce, up 1% today, its highest point since February 2015. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprising to see gold and shares both rallying. But it appears that gold is in demand from investors who are worried about negative interest rates, which have helped drive down the return on many safer assets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a theory that Chinese demand for gold could jump if Beijing imposes capital controls, to prevent money leaving the country. The London Stock Exchange has shown by two rivals want to leap into bed with it, by posting a 31% jump in profits for the last year. CEO Xavier Rolet remained loyal to the main suiter, Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. He said the merger of equals proposed last week was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compelling opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to create a dominant new global trading group. But the strong results may also encourage Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which runs the New York stock exchange, to muscle in. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already considering its options. Joshua Raymond, market analyst at online trading firm XTB.com, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a solid year for the LSE. The focus of course now is whether a rival bid emerges from ICE that could spark a bidding war, or if the firms major shareholders remain convinced a tie up with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse on the already announced conditions is the best way forward for the trading house.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has posted its strongest February sales growth in 12 years, despite another drop in demand for Volkswagen cars New figures from the SMMT show that the new car market grew by 8.4% year-on-year last month, Some 83,395 vehicles being registered, which is the best performance for a February since 2004: The figures also confirm that the emission scandal continues to hurt Volkswagen. Its car sales fell by 13% year on year, from 7,710 to 6,694. Back to economics...and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office has confirmed that the Italian economy grew by a measly 0.1% in the last three months of 2015. Newsflash: Social networking giant Facebook is shaking up its corporate set-up, which should mean it pays rather more tax in the UK. The move follows heavy criticism of US tech firms for using complicated corporate structures to cut their tax liability, apparently legally. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has learned that Facebook will no longer route advertising sales to big UK clients through its Irish operation. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen an internal memo, which explains that: On Monday, we will start notifying large UK customers that from the start of April, they will receive invoices from Facebook UK and not Facebook Ireland, What this means in practice is that UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK, not Ireland. Facebook UK will then record the revenue from these sales. The move is expected to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide transparency to Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the memo adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Facebook to pay millions of pounds more in UK tax Last autumn, it emerged that Facebook UK has only paid \u00c2\u00a34,327 in UK corporation tax. It made revenues of \u00c2\u00a3105m, but booked an accounting loss of \u00c2\u00a328.5m in Britain in 2014, after paying out more than \u00c2\u00a335m to its 362 staff in a share bonus scheme. Advertising giant WPP has flagged up the EU referendum as a clear risk to growth prospects this year. WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell warned against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don Draper-ish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd optimism, given the threats to confidence. He cited the conflict in the Ukraine and the Middle East, and also the Brexit risk, telling the City that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The somewhat surprising result of the UK general lection (at least to the pollsters), with the Conservatives winning an overall majority, has resulted in an uncertainty-stimulating EU referendum, now pegged for 23 June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in WPP are up 0.7% this morning, after it posted solid sales growth of 4.9% in the final quarter of the year. Mining shares are now at a four-month high, having rocketed by 25% this year: European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, as investors get ready for his afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs data. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or 0.6%, to 6166 - which is nearly its highest level this year. Mining companies are topping the biggest risers, indicating renewed confidence in economic prospects, particularly in emerging markets. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 is making another pitch higher in early trade despite yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestions that the bulls may be running out of momentum. Gains are broad based with natural resources stocks once again finding themselves at the top of the board with continued gains for underlying metals prices still lending support here. After a very ropy start to 2016, world stock markets are now at a two-month high That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the MSCI World Market index, which tracks shares in 46 different countries. As this chats shows, share prices are now back at early January levels, before the stock market turmoil began. The recent rally suggests that investor panic over a global downturn was overdone. Now, though, there is talk about whether the market is over-bought - particularly as this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and service-sector data has been somewhat patchy. Chris Weston of IG explains why the rally could fizzle out: There is an air of fatigue from the bulls in a number of developed equity markets, but they continue to grind higher.... But the market is in need of some injection of new news to provide an injection of inspiration and cause a new leg higher. It seems unlikely this inspiration comes from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US payrolls. Stock markets across Asia have rallied today as investors express optimism ahead of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report. Over in Tokyo, the Nikkei gained 0.3%. That pushed the Japanese index to a one-month high, up over 5% this week. Chinese traders showed some confidence too, pushing the Shanghai index up by 0.5%. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, reckons that investors are less worried about the global economy. They are also anticipating that the US Federal Reserve will be reluctant to raise borrowing costs this year, given recent turbulence. Fujito said (via Reuters): Globally, markets are rolling back the extreme risk-off trading they did in January and February. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Part of the reason is that the Fed seems to be easing its insistence on raising rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. One more heave, chaps. After a heavy week for economic data, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big one today - the US Non-Farm Payroll for February, which is due at 1.30pm GMT. The NFP will show how many new jobs were created across America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy last month, and also show whether wages picked up or not. Although prone to later revisions, the Payroll is a crucial measure of the health of the US labo u r market, at a time when worries over the global economy are pretty intense. Economists predict that 195,000 Americans got hired last month, leaving the unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9%. Earnings are tipped to rise by 0.2% month-on-month, down from a chunky 0.5% rise in January. A surprisingly good, or bad, Payroll number could give the markets a shunt and renew concerns about a global recession. But as things stand, shares are expected to rise in Europe in early trading, with the main indices called up around 0.5%. Also coming up today.... Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda has been testifying in Tokyo about monetary policy issues. At 9am,, we get the final estimate of Italian GDP for the last quarter. It will probably confirm that the economy grew by only 0.1%. The latest UK car sales figures (for February) also land at 9am. And in the City, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) and advertising group WPP. Traders will be looking for news about the LSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned merger by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse, which could bd disrupted by a counter-offer from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ICE.",

                "bodyText":"Seven years ago on Saturday (5 March), the Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5%. At the time, the cut and plans to pump billions of pounds of electronic money into the economy seemed like an emergency measure to cushion the UK from the global financial crisis. But borrowing costs are still at their record low and amid warnings that a new global slump is around the corner, Bank policymakers show no signs of raising rates any time soon. We look back over seven years of ultra-loose monetary policy: King and colleagues cut rates and launch QE March 2009: The Bank of England cuts interest rates from 1% to 0.5%, the lowest since the central bank was founded in 1694. Policymakers also push the button on a quantitative easing programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will pump tens of billions of pounds of newly created money into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled economy. It is the sixth time that UK borrowing costs have fallen since October 2008, when rates were still 5%. Announcing the cut to 0.5%, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, led by governor Mervyn King, notes a slowdown in the global economy and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistent problems in international credit markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the UK , it highlights a drop in economic output at the end of 2008, a rise in unemployment and tight credit conditions for businesses and households. King says it is unlikely that the bank rate could go any lower and policymakers will shift focus to creating money instead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are very close to zero. What we are doing now is switching to injecting money into the economy directly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd May 2009: The Bank of England surprises the City by announcing it is to increase the size of its quantitative easing (QE) operation by \u00c2\u00a350bn to \u00c2\u00a3125bn, amid growing concern that the programme announced in March is failing to turn the economy around. It is the first of many increases in QE to come over the years that follow, taking the total to \u00c2\u00a3375bn. On the same day in May 2009, the European Central Bank (ECB) cuts interest rates to a record low of 1% and says it will follow the Bank of England in launching QE in a bid to pull the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stricken economy out of recession. May 2010: A new coalition government is formed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats after the general election. Bank of England governor Mervyn King gives his strong backing for spending cuts in new chancellor George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first budget to come later in the summer. June 2010: George Osborne announces the biggest shakeup in City regulation since 1997 and hands sweeping new powers to the Bank of England designed to prevent a fresh financial crisis. King emerges as the big winner from the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shakeup of supervision that will abolish the Financial Services Authority. The Bank is given new tools to prevent bubbles from developing in the financial system, including the right to force banks to hold more capital during boom periods. September 2010: The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor Charlie Bean urges Britons to go out and spend to help invigorate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery. Rising inflation stokes rate rise bets February 2011: Following a VAT rise and a pick-up in petrol prices, official figures show inflation hit 4% in January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Inflation goes up further over following months and peaks at 5.2% in September 2011. City speculation rises that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates within months to curb price pressures. The CBI business group predicts interest rates will begin to rise in the next few months and will end the year at 1.25%. Minutes from the latest monetary policy committee meeting show concerns about inflation are growing there too. Two members voted for a quarter-point rise in interest rates while a third urged a half-point rise. July 2011: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone counterpart, the European Central Bank, shrugs off the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis and raises interest rates for the second time in 2011 to curb inflation. The move takes the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark rate to 1.5%. The ECB is forced to start reversing those rises before the year is out amid fears the eurozone crisis could tip economies in the single currrency bloc back into recession. August 2011: Against the background of wild swings on world stock markets, the two hawkish members of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee abandon their calls for borrowing costs to rise. Central banks act to stop new credit crunch November 2011: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major central banks pledge concerted emergency measures to underpin fragile eurozone banks and prevent the global financial system from freezing up. After a teleconference chaired by King involving six central banks, they announce \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coordinated central bank action to address pressures in global money markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The moves are reminiscent of autumn 2008, when central banks came together to slash interest rates and inject liquidity into financial markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. More QE and a new funding for lending scheme July 2012: The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee votes to raise the total amount of quantitative easing to \u00c2\u00a3375bn, citing signs that the global economy is flagging and having knock-on effects on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The move coincided with interest rate cuts in the crisis-hit eurozone and in China. Later the same month, the Bank of England unveils a scheme to boost lending to first-time buyers and small companies in a move that ministers hope will inject fresh funds into the ailing UK economy. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding for lending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scheme is welcomed by the chancellor, George Osborne, who says the launch of the \u00c2\u00a380bn emergency facility shows Britain is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not powerless to act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the face of the eurozone crisis. The scheme offers cut-price loans to banks and building societies, which are expected to make the money available through mortgages to homebuyers and loans to small businesses. But experts warn the new cash may not reach those who need it the most. August 2012: A Bank of England paper concludes that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest 5% gained most from quantitative easing. Threadneedle Street said that wealthy families had been the biggest beneficiaries of its \u00c2\u00a3375bn QE programme but also insists the scheme has helped all sections of the population by sparing the country from a deeper slump. November 2012: The Treasury announces that big cash balances amassed by the Bank of England as a result of its electronic money-creation programme will be used to pay down the national debt by \u00c2\u00a335bn over the next 18 months. Osborne wants Threadneedle Street to hand over the interest payments it has received on the gilts bought since the start of the QE scheme in early 2009. Mark Carney appointed King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor November 2012: George Osborne springs a surprise on the City by announcing Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief will succeed Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, is the first non-Briton to become Bank of England governor. He is largely unknown outside the cloistered circles of central bankers and financial regulators, but has gained a reputation as a tough operator able to confront leading banks at the heart of the financial crisis. It later emerges that Carney will pocket an annual \u00c2\u00a3250,000 housing allowance, taking his total pay package to \u00c2\u00a3874,000 a year when he takes the reins in the summer of 2013. July 2013: Mark Carney takes over from Mervyn King as Bank of England governor. On his first day in the new job, Carney arrives in Threadneedle Street by tube. Carney launches forward guidance August 2013: New Bank of England governor Mark Carney unveils a strategy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, under which policymakers will not consider raising rates until unemployment declines to 7% (from 7.8%). The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast puts unemployment above 7% in 2016. The governor says the Bank will only think again about its pro-growth stance if there is a threat of higher inflation or asset bubbles. The scheme is greeted with scepticism in the City. Long-term interest rates, set by investors in financial markets, rise after forward guidance is first announced, amid a slew of upbeat data about house prices, retail spending and business confidence. September 2013: Chancellor George Osborne says he is giving the Bank of England greater powers to prevent the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help-to-buy scheme causing a property boom. November 2013: Bank governor Mark Carney reins in the mortgage market in a bid to prevent five years of ultra-low interest rates and George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help-to-buy scheme from fuelling a housing bubble. Carney announces he is refocusing the funding for lending scheme that gave lenders financial incentives to provide home loans. The focus will now be on business lending, the governor says. February 2014: Just six months after forward guidance was launched the unemployment rate has already dropped below 7% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two years earlier than the Bank had been expecting. Carney signals, however, that the Bank will keep interest rates at the record low of 0.5% for at least another year and that policymakers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not take risks with this recovery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also insists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward guidance is working\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. May 2014: Mark Carney warns that the housing market poses the biggest risk to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery as a shortage of new homes drives up prices. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd warns of rate rise ahead June 2014: Bank of England gets new powers to control the size of mortgages. Carney warns that interest rates are likely to rise before the end of 2014. Later that month, members of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury select committee accuse the Bank of behaving like an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, giving mixed messages on when the first rise in interest rates is likely. September 2014: Carney warns workers they face higher interest rates in the spring of 2015 before they receive rises in real wages. Deflation threat sparks rate cut talk March 2015: With inflation falling closer to zero, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane suggests policymakers may be forced to slash interest rates to zero in the coming months to tackle the threat of deflation. Official figures after Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks show that inflation has dropped to zero for the first time on record in Britain. Inflation was pushed down by a deep oil price slump and a fierce price war being fought out by supermarkets. Inflation, measured on the consumer prices index (CPI), turns negative in April. May 2015: The coalition government is replaced by a Conservative government. The coalition was the first administration in more than half a century to enjoy unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. In the first announcement from the Bank under the new Conservative government, interest rates are again held at 0.5%. New rate rise hints from Carney July 2015: The BoE governor says an interest rate hike in the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moving closer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He tells the Treasury select committee households should start to manage their finances with a future hike in mind and he notes the UK economy has been performing well, that wages are starting to pick up and that employment has seen a big increase. Later that month, Carney suggests the first interest rate rise since the global financial crash could come around the turn of the year. In a speech, he adds that after an extended period of what were expected to be emergency rates, borrowing costs were likely to peak at just over 2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c half their average historic norm since the Bank was founded in 1694. But minutes from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest rate-setting meeting show concerns among policymakers that slow progress resolving the Greek debt crisis could delay a rate rise. Chinese slowdown fears intensify August 2015: China devalues its yuan currency against the dollar, sending shockwaves through global markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c already jittery over signs of a worsening slowdown in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and wild swings on its stock markets. The currency move dampens talk of interest rate rises in the US and UK given the prospect that cheaper Chinese goods will reduce inflationary pressures in those countries. But Carney says that while a slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could push down further on inflation, it does not change, for now, the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on when and how it might increase interest rates. September 2015: BoE chief economist Haldane again warns that interest rates may have to be cut further from their record low level as he highlights signs that the global financial crisis is entering a third phase of turmoil. Haldane is speaking a day after the US central bank decided to delay an interest rate rise for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy. The US rate-setters blamed a more fragile global outlook in remarks that further rattled jittery financial markets. November 2015: The Bank of England is ready to step up controls on the housing market if a prolonged period of record low interest rates risks inflating a property bubble, Carney says. As he signals that interest rates are likely to remain on hold well into 2016, Carney suggested the Bank may have to revert to other measures, such as tighter lending rules, to keep a lid on house prices. February 2016: Carney says policymakers in the UK could cut interest rates to zero if necessary, but would seek to avoid following Sweden, Denmark and the eurozone by setting negative rates to bolster growth and inflation. Responding to questions from MPs on the Treasury select committee, Carney says the world economy has entered a period of low growth and low interest rates and is likely to be prone to financial shocks. March 2016: The UK marks seven years of record low interest rates. New research marking the anniversary claims rock bottom borrowing costs and quantitative have cost savers an estimated \u00c2\u00a3160bn, but supported strong increases in the prices of property, stocks and bonds. In its analysis, financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown suggests loose monetary policy has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153annihilated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd returns on cash.",

                "body":"<p>Leading shares are heading lower as investors take profits after recent gains, but an expection is<strong> Old Mutual</strong>.</p> <p>The investment group has jumped 14.6p or 8% to 194.3p following weekend reports it could be preparing a \u00c2\u00a39bn break-up. Sky News said it was working on a plan to split into standalone companies comprising its stake in South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nedbank, its UK wealth business, its South African emerging markets division and its institutional asset management operations.</p> <p>Two private equity firms were already said to have tabled offers for Old Mutual Wealth. </p> <p>In response Old Mutual has said it was conducting a strategic review, and said all options were being considered. But no decision had yet been made. It will provide an update with Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Old Mutual Wealth has developed a vertically integrated model in the UK with the Skandia platform sitting alongside distributor Intrinsic and the asset management business OMGI, together with its in-house manufacturer. Total asset amounted to \u00c2\u00a398.7bn at the end of November 2015 (current figure is likely to be lower) with 2015 operating profits expected to amount to around \u00c2\u00a3265m.</p> <p>With a fair wind this business could be worth around 15 times 2015 full year earnings which would imply a figure of around \u00c2\u00a33bn, equivalent to around 3% of funds.

                "bodyText":"Leading shares are heading lower as investors take profits after recent gains, but an expection is Old Mutual. The investment group has jumped 14.6p or 8% to 194.3p following weekend reports it could be preparing a \u00c2\u00a39bn break-up. Sky News said it was working on a plan to split into standalone companies comprising its stake in South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nedbank, its UK wealth business, its South African emerging markets division and its institutional asset management operations. Two private equity firms were already said to have tabled offers for Old Mutual Wealth. In response Old Mutual has said it was conducting a strategic review, and said all options were being considered. But no decision had yet been made. It will provide an update with Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: Old Mutual Wealth has developed a vertically integrated model in the UK with the Skandia platform sitting alongside distributor Intrinsic and the asset management business OMGI, together with its in-house manufacturer. Total asset amounted to \u00c2\u00a398.7bn at the end of November 2015 (current figure is likely to be lower) with 2015 operating profits expected to amount to around \u00c2\u00a3265m. With a fair wind this business could be worth around 15 times 2015 full year earnings which would imply a figure of around \u00c2\u00a33bn, equivalent to around 3% of funds. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current market capitalisation of \u00c2\u00a38.9bn compares to our adjusted group value of around \u00c2\u00a310bn, within which Old Mutual Wealth accounts for around \u00c2\u00a32.0bn\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6hence, a disposal/demerger at this value could add around \u00c2\u00a31bn to this figure, equivalent to around 20p per share. We believe that such a disposal or demerger of Old Mutual Wealth is a distinct possibility. The interaction with the South African life and banking operations is pretty limited and, indeed, probably introduces the conglomerate discount that the stock has traded on for quite a while. In addition, we remind readers of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous record of such radical moves, such as the sale of Skandia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Scandinavian business a few years ago, and the subsequent return of capital. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Investors will be hoping that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of 2+2=5 with the individual assets of the company being worth more on a stand-alone basis than whilst held together. Some might argue the timing is rather fortuitous just days before results, getting the shares back to the 200p mark last traded in early December. It also closes the December gap down when South Africa-exposed stocks were hurt by the ousting of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, stoking scepticism among foreign investors. However, Barclays announcement that it is exiting Africa implies interest from suitors for operations in the geography and potential for transactions while suggestions are that the wealth division is being eyed by a pair of buyout firms. Meanwhile JP Morgan Cazenove has issued an underweight rating on equities after the recent rebound, but said the UK was still its top regional pick despite the worries about Brexit. Overall with mining shares lower, despite China saying over the weekend it expected growth of 6.5% to 7%, the FTSE 100 is down 34.15 points 6165.28. Glencore is down 6.3p at 153.7p and Anglo American is 22.9p lower at 569.1p. Randgold Resources has dropped 290p to \u00c2\u00a363.25 as Morgan Stanley moved from overweight to equal weight, while Fresnillo has fallen 21p to 938p after the bank cut its rating from equal weight to underweight.

                "bodyText":"The Eurogroup has said debt relief talks for Greece are on the table, but are dependent on the necessary reforms to tax and pensions. More work is needed, and the Eurogroup called on the institutions and the Greek government to put extra effort in to reach agreement. Representatives of the creditors - the troika - will return to Athens tomorrow, but the process needs to be speeded up, so the debt relief talks will be brought forward. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Klaus Regling, head of the eurozone rescue fund the ESM, said Greek liquidity was getting tighter but: Will the debt issue be part of the first review? Dijsselbloem: The review is on the implementation of what was agreed so debt relief not part of that. But there is a strong link between the two. We have agreed there should be fiscal targets and pension reform, so fiscal sustainability long term will be part of debt discussions. [To bring them together} we need to speed up review process and bring forward debt discussion, which could allow us to reach political agreement. Was there discussion about debt relief today? Dijsselbloem: We did not, but I flagged to my colleagues that discussions about debt relief would need to come in the short term future. As soon as we know the outcome on reforms and tax etc then we know what the remaining issue of debt relief will be. And after a final question on Portugal the press conference ends. The review was said to be completed by Easter but that is not straightforward: IMF have asked for more to be done, and also made strong debt relief case, are you in that camp now? Dijsselbloem: Have to be more on table than there is now or it will not work. Not in any camp but there is a link between depth of reforms and any remaining debt issue. More you do on reform, smaller fiscal gaps will be and less of a debt issue there will be in the future. We will put pressure on all sides to make sure it adds up, as IMF says. Questions: Could debt talks start before completion of review? Dijsselbloem: Need to know the outcome of the reforms, but there is going to be a point where all this comes together. On other matters, the Eurogroup says Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high debt burden remains a concern. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was very happy with the agreement. It would allow the mission chiefs (the creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 representatives) to go to Athens as soon as tomorrow to lead discussions on a review of the agreement. He said there were five issues in particular: establish a privatisation fund; reform income tax; reform pensions; create independent revenue agency; cope with non-performing loans. He said they would work with Greece on steps to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018. The troika will return to Athens, confirms Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup at a press conference following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. But he said more effort needed to be put in to get a good outcome, and there were still fiscal gaps to be filled and some reforms needed to be deepened. He called on the institutions (the creditors) and in particular the Greek government to put in the extra effort. On debt, they had said if the Greek government delivered a primary surplus \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we would do what was necessary to make [the] debt manageable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said they had now made explicit that those discussions would be on the table. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Commission vice presdient Valdis Dombrovskis on the situation with Greece: A rebound in oil - above $40 a barrel for the first time since December - and metal prices - iron ore in particular - has lifted commodity companies and helped leading shares in Europe recover some of their early losses. Markets ended mostly lower, hit by gloomy comments from the Bank of International Settlements and some profit taking ahead of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate-setting meeting this week. But the strength in commodities and a rally on Wall Street after an early dip helped European markets to recover some ground. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.03 points or 0.27% at 6182.40 having earlier fallen as low as 6125 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.46% to 9778.93 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.32% at 4442.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.2% to 18,059.27 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 8786.8 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.19% to 559.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 57 points or 0.34%. Cyprus has exited its bailout programme ahead of schedule, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a statement from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde: More on the prospect of talks over debt relief for Greece. Reuters reports: The head of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem asked euro zone finance ministers meeting on Monday to prepare to start talks on debt relief for Greece in April, a euro zone official said. Talks on the debt relief can only start once Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders -- euro zone governments and the International Monetary Fund -- agree that the country has delivered on reforms pledged in August in exchange for cheap loans. This reform assessment, called the first review, stalled in February over details of the politically very difficult pension reform and because of diverging views between the euro zone and the IMF on how to make the economy and debt sustainable in the longer term. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters before the ministerial meeting he expected the ministers to decide on Monday to send the reform review team back to Greece. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he would support sending the team already this week. Two euro zone officials, who asked not to be named, said the lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 representatives may set out already on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lenders mission will return to Athens on Tuesday,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Greek government official said. Confirmation from Germany that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors could return to Athens this week: Brent crude has hit $40 a barrel for the first time since early December. The move comes on hopes of continuing economic recovery in China, which set a target of 6.5% to 7% growth this year, which has boosted commodity prices generally. On top of that US data from information firm Genscape showed a lower than expected increase in stocks at the Cushing delivery hub in Oklahoma, at the same time as hopes are growing that producers could act to tackle the problem of oversupply. Back with Greece and reports are coming in that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international creditors will return to Athens on Tuesday, according to a Greek government official. And Reuters is quoting a eurozone official saying that ministers were told to prepare for the start of talks on debt relief for Greece in April. Meanwhile US markets have continued the downward trend being seen elsewhere. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally investors have decided to cash in some of their gains ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, when further interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures are expected. There is scope for disappointment here, however, as ECB president Mario Draghi tries to live up to his promises of taking all necessary action. The earlier gloomy report from the Bank of International Settlements, warning of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gathering storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the global economy, is not helping sentiment. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 33 points or 0.19, while at the open the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.45% and Nasdaq 0.56% lower. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has urged its creditors to return to Athens and finish signing off its bailout review. Euclid Tsakalotos told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the two sides can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply keep arguing over pension reforms forever. He wants the institutions to accept Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, opening the door for talks on debt relief. Tsakalotos said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This question of time is important if we want to move from a vicious to a virtuous circle. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue debating over pension reforms forever, as if to keep a wound open.....Pensions are part of the social safety net.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Greece urges completion of reform review by May 1 Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup, has warned Greece that it must stick to its bailout deal. Arriving at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said ministers would listen to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the institutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders - and see how all sides can move forward.. But he insists that Greece cannot wriggle out of making the pension reforms demanded by creditors, saying: We need credible and sustainable pension reforms and the budget needs to be on track for the medium-term. This is not just something that concerns the IMF, it is something that concerns all the institutions and the eurogroup. We need to stick to the agreement that we had this summer. Dijsselbloem adds that he hopes to hear more details today about how pension reforms will work out. Those reforms are hugely unpopular in Greece, where farmers have been holding protests against pension cuts for months. Pierre Moscovici, EC commissioner for economic affair, is also speaking to the press. He hopes that the eurogroup will take a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunanimous decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that the mission chiefs representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors should return to Athens ASAP to conclude the current bailout review (which has been bogged down for months). Oil is also rising today, with Brent crude gaining over 1% to $39.50. Shares in Brazil mining group Vale have leapt by 8%, following the massive rally in iron ore this morning. Eurozone finance ministers should be arriving at EU headquarters shortly, for a regular eurogroup meeting. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be playing second-fiddle to the big EU Migration Summit, where leaders are wrangling over the refugee crisis. But the meeting could still be significant, given the deadlock between Greece and its lenders over the implementation of its bailout programme. D\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu all over again. Again. Eurogroup ministers are planning to look at what needs to be done to allow the first review of the bailout to be successfully completed (after many delays). And that list includes some serious challenges, including: ...reforming the pension system, fiscal strategy, making the privatisation fund operational and addressing the issue of non-performing loans, among other issues. The lack of progress is fuelling concerns over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in the eurozone, particularly as the refugee crisis is putting further pressure on its economy, and fuelling EU tensions. Former finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has told our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, that the situation is boiling up again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the situation right now is more dangerous than it was last summer [when Greece agreed its third bailout]. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then it was a question of the political will of a few people. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of implementing reforms and working hard and if a government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe in them and implements them begrudgingly, progress becomes very difficult.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a great few months for Goldman Sachs, and clients who followed its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctop tips for 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Wall Street bank just closed all six trades, with five making losses. The failed bets included: Buying the dollar against the yen and the euro Buying yields on Italian bonds versus German ones Wagering that large US banks would outperform the general markek And betting that US inflation expectations would rise They were based on the idea that the US economy would strengthen this year, allowing the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates and pushing up the dollar. Unfortunately (for Goldman), the panic that gripped investors in January and February meant the markets moved against them. This chart of daily price moves confirms that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20% surge in iron ore is way, way, outside the norm: Commodity prices took a fierce battering in 2015, so investors may now be scrambling to get on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcright side\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a rebound. Especially if fears of a global recession are fading. Rating agency Fitch has slashed its growth forecasts but predicted the world will avoid another full-blown recession. It now expects the world economy to expand by just 2.5% this year, not the 2.9% expected three months ago. That would only equal 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate. Fitch expects advanced economies to expand by only 1.7%, down from 2.1% in December. For emerging markets, 2016 growth is now pegged at 4.0%, down from 4.4%. Encouragingly, Fitch believes we will avoid a severe downturn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With emerging markets at the epicentre of these shocks and now accounting for 40% of world GDP it is legitimate to ask whether the world will see, for more or less the first time in recent history, an emerging market led global recession. However, we believe several factors mitigate this risk. Firstly, labour market conditions in many of the major advanced economies look quite robust. Along with the benefits of lower oil prices on real incomes, this should help support consumer spending in rich countries and cushion the shock. Advanced economies look to be beyond the worst of the private sector deleveraging forces that held back domestic demand growth in the years following the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the impact of fiscal policy on growth in the advanced economies is currently less restrictive than it has been in the last few years. The iron ore price is on an absolute tear this morning, surging by almost 20%. The cause of the mega-rally isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite clear, but it follows speculation that the commodity crunch has bottomed out. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest government targets could also be driving demand. Over the weekend, Beijing committed to a target growth rate of 6.5% to 7% this year, and a budget deficit of 3% of GDP. Some traders think this equals another dose of fiscal stimulus, pushing demand for commodities up. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets continue to lose ground this morning. BIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of troubles ahead, the weak German factory orders data, and the drop in investor confidence reported by Sentix may all be weighing on sentiment on an otherwise quiet day. In London, the FTSE 100 has now shed 55 points. Miners are the big fallers, reversing some of their recent strong rally. Anglo American has shed 4%. Investors are already fretting about Thursday, when the European Central Bank holds its next monetary policy meeting. Everyone expects the ECB to announce something new on the stimulus front. But some fear a repeat of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, when market expectations weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully met. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: After a tentative start the bears took hold this Monday, the European indices all sliding into the red with last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence replaced by pre-ECB nerves. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear what has inspired this shift in sentiment; general fears over the myriad of macro-maladies currently circling the markets appears to be the driving force this Monday, with this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning from the BIS and the looming ECB meeting on Thursday only exacerbating matters. There is a chance this kind of jittery trading will continue until Mario Draghi puts the market out of its misery and reveals, for better or for worse, what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually means this time around. Eurozone investor confidence has fallen to its lowest level in almost a year. Sentix, the German research group, reports that fears over the global economy hit morale among eurozone analysts and investors this month. Its economic index fell to 5.5, from 6.0 last month, which is the lowest since April 2015. Patrick Hussy, Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, says the Eurozone is suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the loss of economic momentum of the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hussy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believes it should spur the European Central Bank into agreeing new stimulus measures at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective on the current situation in the Eurozone should resupply dovish members of the ECB council with enough ammunition to demand significantly more expansive monetary stimulus on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting. Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrent conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sub-index fell from 10.5 to 8.3, suggesting the eurozone economy has suffered from the market turbulence and gloom in early 2016 But more encouragingly, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfuture expectations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measure rose to 2.8, from the 1.5 it slumped to in February. That may mean that confidence will rise again soon. Hussy says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations are slowly turning against the negative trend.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The CEO of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EDF has pledged to take a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinal decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 soon on the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor, following the shock resignation of his finance chief: Dirk Schlotboeller, economist at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DIHK Chambers of Commerce. argues that German factories were lucky to only suffer a 0.1% drop in orders in January. Schlotboeller says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could have been worse in light of the bad news and turbulence on stock markets at the beginning of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry has warned that storm clouds are gathering over its manufacturing sector. Following the 1.6% drop in domestic factory orders in January, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the two months, the impulses are from abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, expectations in industry have become considerably overcast and signal only a modest economic upswing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in French energy company EDF slumped by almost 10% at the start of trading, following the shock resignation of its finance director. Thomas Piquemal quit after opposing the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to build a new \u00c2\u00a318bn nuclear power station for the UK at Hinkley Point. Energy editor Terry Macalister explain: A new plant at Hinkley, in Somerset, is desperately needed and has been heavily promoted by the chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as a key part of keeping the lights on in Britain. But EDF has been hit by a series of problems that have led many \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in the City of London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to conclude that the new nuclear plant project is on the verge of collapse. Piquemal is said to have been arguing that pursuing what would be the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most expensive power project at this moment could jeopardise the French group, which already has rising debts. More here: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has slipped a little in early trading following the factory orders report. The DAX fell almost 0.5%, with investors also digesting BIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of global turmoil ahead. Germany has got the new week off to a poor start, by reporting that factory orders dipped last month. Industrial orders at the eurozone powerhouse economy fell by 0.1% month-on-month, adding to a 0.2% slide in December (revised up from -0.7%). Significantly, the fall was partly due to weaker demand from within Germany - suggesting that its economic growth may be stumbling. The Economy Ministry reports that domestic orders fell by 1.6% during the month, quite a hefty drop. And Germany manufacturers were also heavily reliant on other members of the single currency for export sales, as it felt the impact of slowing emerging markets. Sales to other eurozone members leapt by 7.5%, while exports to non-eurozone countries slid by 2.7%. That meant that overall export orders rose by 1%. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week begins with a serious warning from the Bank for International Settlements that the global markets could be heading into new turbulence. In its latest quarterly report, BIS has warned that that global credit boom could be on the point of unraveling. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uneasy calm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has settled on the markets in recent weeks could be about to burst. BIS, known as the central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central bank, is worried that policymakers are now short of ammunition, at a time when the global economy looks fragile. It reckons that the credit cycle could have reached a turning point, with as the amount of debt being issued by emerging economies stalled in the last quarter. Claudio Borio, BIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may not be seeing isolated bolts from the blue, but the signs of a gathering storm that has been building for a long time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BIS has been waving a red flag for years, saying the global economy has been piling up too much debt, rather than tackling the underlying problems of weak productivity and unreformed economic systems. BIS also fired a warning shot towards negative interest rates. It fears that the new fashion will backfire - potentially making commercial banks unprofitable,. It cautioned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The viability of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business model as financial intermediaries may be brought into question.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A timely warning, as the European Central Bank could impose deeper negative interest rates at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee meeting. The report is online here. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on BIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns: Also coming up today: Eurozone finance ministers will be holding a regular eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be considering Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, and the deadlock between Athens and its creditors. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic calendar, but we do get the latest Sentix investor confidence report at 9.30am GMT.",

However, Draghi may not want to push too much, preferring instead to avoid risking a split vote in the Governing Council. Given the large menu of options, the outcome is very difficult to predict in detail. New staff projections will revise the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro outlook, especially for inflation, to be significantly lower. Falling inflation expectations and continued downward revisions to inflation projections increase risks of second-round effects. This will put the ECB under considerable pressure to deliver more, not only to boost growth and inflation, but also to avoid disappointing already high market expectations, which would results in tighter financial conditions.</p> <p>Our main scenario is a 10 basis point deposit rate cut, the introduction of a two-tiered deposit rate system and the announcement of an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in monthly asset purchases. The two-tiered system will alleviate cost pressures on banks and keep hopes of further rate cuts alive.

Despite the incredible rally in iron ore yesterday, the 25% fall in exports and 14% drop in imports for February prove it pays to be apprehensive about the Chinese growth story for now.

Despite the high likeliness of action from the ECB, there is no guarantee of the direction markets will move and thus traders are unlikely to be as bold this time, after being burnt three months ago. Deposit rate cuts seem the likeliest, yet this is unlikely to appease QE thirsty markets which have proven to be relatively single minded in their view of what represents a satisfactory policy boost.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56de9acbe4b098a94cd4e2d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T10:19:39.937Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After two hours of trading, European markets are steadily in the red following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rough Chinese trade data.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is still down around 1%, and there are chunkier losses across the continent where the French CAC and German DAX have both lost around 1.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d091c8cbfc6151b76f4c72b98ca43f19af3f5c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d091c8cbfc6151b76f4c72b98ca43f19af3f5c6/0_0_802_179/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets this morning\" width=\"500\" height=\"112\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets this morning</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mike van Dulken</strong>, head of research at <strong>Accendo Markets</strong>, says investors are worried by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/08/chinese-exports-german-industrial-production-markets-greece-business-live?page=with:block-56de809ee4b0b7476e1beab2#block-56de809ee4b0b7476e1beab2\">the 25% year-on-year tumble in Chinese exports</a> last month. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equity markets are in the red again this morning<strong>,</strong> with disappointing overnight Chinese trade data showing plunging February exports (-25%) serving to spook investors who are already concerned about the state of global growth.</p> <p>The market reaction is in stark contrast to the habitual cheering about bad data implying more stimulus, and the Lunar New Year may explain the big drop.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56de990ce4b0b7476e1beadb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T09:32:23.410Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Carney testifies on Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bank of England governor <strong>Mark Carney</strong> has just begun giving evidence to the Treasury committee on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/cbd977ab-8315-4812-bb42-5573f0332373\">You can watch it live here</a>.</h2> <p>Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the action:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/08/boris-johnson-abandons-city-hall-eu-referendum-gag-after-hypocrisy-claim-politics-live\">Boris Johnson abandons City Hall EU referendum gag after hypocrisy claim -  Politics live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T09:34:11.815Z\">at 9.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56de9924e4b0576c0864dc3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T09:26:03.115Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oxford Economics have just issued a new report on the EU referendum.</strong><br></p> <p>It has found that a vote for Brexit will knock over 1% off the size of the UK economy, and also hit share prices.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A scenario run on the Oxford Global Model suggests that Brexit would leave the level of UK GDP 1.3 percentage points lower by Q2 2018 compared with our baseline forecast that the UK votes to stay in the EU. A vote to leave would mainly shock business confidence but consumers would be adversely affected too. Exporters in price-sensitive sectors would benefit from a weaker exchange rate.</p> <p>Market pricing suggests that sterling could initially fall by around 15% before recovering some of its losses, while the heightened uncertainty would also be expected to drive a sharp drop in equity prices in H2 2016.</p> <p>Brexit would present something of a dilemma for policymakers. While a weaker pound would cause inflation to initially spike upwards, we would expect the MPC to look through this and cutBank Rate in order to support activity. And with the UK likely to retain its reputation as a safe haven, this would also see gilt yields stay lower for longer.</p> <p>Weaker growth would also put the Chancellor in breach of the fiscal mandate, though we would expect him to plead extenuating circumstances, rather than tighten policy and potentially exacerbate the slowdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>They also reckon, though, that Britain will vote to stay in the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/707133003680620544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oxford Economics: &quot;We would attribute a probability of around 70% that the UK votes to remain in the EU.&quot;</p>&mdash; Kamal Ahmed (@bbckamal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/707133003680620544\">March 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T09:27:16.555Z\">at 9.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56de97a1e4b0b7476e1bead8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T09:18:28.843Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IMF to issue Brexit report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The International Monetary Fund is preparing a report on the impact of Britain voting to leave the European Union.</strong></p> <p>IMF chief Christine Lagarde announced the plan this morning, and also appeared to reveal that it will warn against Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/707125496925036544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Christine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde\">@Lagarde</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BizLive?src=hash\">#BizLive</a> now - on Brexit. &quot;I believe our economic findings will strongly support view it would hurt the UK and EU.&quot;</p>&mdash; Kamal Ahmed (@bbckamal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/707125496925036544\">March 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeKyris/status/707127148604211200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IMF?src=hash\">#IMF</a> report on (negative) impact of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> on both the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash\">#UK</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU?src=hash\">#EU</a> to be published in May, says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde\">@Lagarde</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews\">@BBCNews</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUref?src=hash\">#EUref</a></p>&mdash; George Kyris (@GeorgeKyris) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeKyris/status/707127148604211200\">March 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56de942fe4b0576c0864dc30\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-08T09:04:36.698Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Union anger over Npower job cuts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"44feafa3c05e3ea668be8428bf952e6b498e78bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44feafa3c05e3ea668be8428bf952e6b498e78bd/60_316_3058_1104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign hangs outside an npower building in Solihull, Britain March 7, 2016.

                "bodyText":"A combination of weak Chinese export figures hitting commodity companies and a falling oil price has sent European stock markets lower for the second day running. The disappointing trade figures from China renewed fears of a slowdown in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy, although this was tempered by the thought that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank could be prompted to step in again with further stimulus measures. Investors were also unsettled by a fall in oil prices following comments from Goldman Sachs that the recent rally was unjustified, and suggestions from Kuwait that it would not join in an output freeze unless other major producers, notably Iran, agreed. Iran has only just returned to export markets after sanctions were lifted and would rather ramp up production again rather than agree cuts. So Brent crude, after earlier climbing as high as $41.48 a barrel, is now down nearly 3% at $39.77. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 56.96 points or 0.92% at 6125.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.88% to 9692.82 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.86% at 4404.02 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 0.23% to 18,017.56 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.53% lower at 8740.3 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.76% to 563.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 46 points or 0.28%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Come to that, the US Federal Reserve does not have an easy decision to make at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Many believe its decision to raise rates in December was a mistake, and the chances of it hiking again in March seemed to be getting slimmer. But it could yet act: Meanwhile the European Central Bank has its own dilemma on Thursday, in terms of what further stimulus measures it unveils. In December it ended up falling short of expectations: The Bank of England is still more likely to raise rates than cut them over the next two years, according to monetary policy committee member Martin Weale, despite the recent financial turmoil. In a speech at the University of Nottingham Weale, who backed a rate rise in 2014, said the Bank had other tools to boost the economy if necessary. More quantitative easing could be used, with the Bank possibly buying private sector assets as well as government bonds. But he said a rate cut below 0.5% could also be made if needed. More big bonuses for bankers. Royal Bank of Scotland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bailed-out bank which is 73% owned by the UK taxpayer and recently reported its eighth consecutive year of annual losses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has handed its top management team bonuses in shares worth \u00c2\u00a317.4m, writes Jill Treanor. The full story is here: Markets continue to head lower as the oil price falls and mining stocks suffer in the wake of the Chinese trade data. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data provided the perfect excuse for some nifty profit-taking (and hearty back-slapping) for anyone with the bravery to buy into mining shares back in January. Since then the sector has sky-rocketed, but with Goldmans calling the end of the rally in raw materials, these hardy souls can hardly be blamed for taking some of their gains off the table. Had such dire trade figures arrived during the turmoil of last August, or indeed during the slumps of January and February, we may have seen a bigger reaction. As it was, the market seems content to write the data off as in the past, with recent currency depreciation and signs of stimulus likely to make next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers look much better. Sterling is also heading lower: Oil has been slipping back from its highs and adding to the negative sentiment, although Brent crude is still above the $40 a barrel mark. A note earlier from Goldman Sachs suggested the recent rally in crude may be overdone, with the market still oversupplied and prices needing to fall further for stocks to shrink substantially. Meanwhile hopes of a cut in output were dampened by comments from Kuwait. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting oil minister Anas al-Saleh said it would only commit to a production freeze if major suppliers including Iran agreed to join the agreement. Iran of course has only recently been allowed back on the export market after sanctions were lifted and is understandably keen to keep production going. If some producers failed to join the freeze, Reuters reported him saying: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go full power if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no agreement. Every barrel I produce, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll sell. Brent is currently down 1.7% at $40.16 a barrel having earlier reached $41.48. With global markets under pressure after the disappointing Chinese export figures, it is no surprise Wall Street is following suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 84 points or 0.48% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.47% lower and Nasdaq fell 0.7%. ECB president Mario Draghi has a number of options for further stimulus measures at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank meeting and is under pressure not to disappoint the markets again (as happened in December), says Richard Falkenhall, senior foreign exchange strategist at Nordic bank SEB: Mario Draghi and the ECB are expected to deliver more stimulus on Thursday. However, Draghi may not want to push too much, preferring instead to avoid risking a split vote in the Governing Council. Given the large menu of options, the outcome is very difficult to predict in detail. New staff projections will revise the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro outlook, especially for inflation, to be significantly lower. Falling inflation expectations and continued downward revisions to inflation projections increase risks of second-round effects. This will put the ECB under considerable pressure to deliver more, not only to boost growth and inflation, but also to avoid disappointing already high market expectations, which would results in tighter financial conditions. Our main scenario is a 10 basis point deposit rate cut, the introduction of a two-tiered deposit rate system and the announcement of an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in monthly asset purchases. The two-tiered system will alleviate cost pressures on banks and keep hopes of further rate cuts alive. For now, we expect this will largely satisfy markets, resulting in only limited market reactions in such a scenario. Over to Greece, and representatives of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors may be heading back to Athens to restart work on reviewing the progress of its bailout, but they may struggle to get around the place later this week: David Lipton ended his speech with a Churchillian call for better monetary, fiscal, and structural policies to tackle the economic crisis. Now is the time to decisively support economic activity and put the global economy on a sounder footing. This requires some tough choices, with advanced economies in particular needing to step up to the plate through the three-pronged approach I have described, as well as measures to make the global financial system more efficient and resilient. Winston Churchill said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never worry about action, but only inaction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is one of those moments where action\u00e2\u20ac\u201dconcerted action\u00e2\u20ac\u201d is needed. This, Lipton argued, would help to heal the banking sector, provide support to emerging economies, and help countries to lower their debt-to-GDP ratios over time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full speech: Policy Imperatives for Boosting Global Growth and Prosperity The deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund is urging governments to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd action to steer the world economy away from potential crisis. David Lipton, First Deputy managing director of the Fund, is telling an audience in Washington DC that risks to the global recovery have risen. He says: Global economic recovery continues, but we are clearly at a delicate juncture, where risk of economic derailment has grown. Lipton cites the volatile financial markets and low commodity prices as key factors, along with the concerns that governments and central bankers have run out of ideas, or enthusiasm. These concerns are partly being fed by a perception that policymakers in many economies have run out of ammunition or lost the resolve to deploy it. For the sake of the global economy, it is imperative that advanced and developing countries dispel this dangerous notion by reviving the bold spirit of action and cooperation that characterized the early years of the recovery effort. And crucially, he says governments should use their tax and spending muscle to prevent another global downturn. Fiscal polices should be made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more growth-friendly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where possible, argues Lipton. And countries with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiscal space\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should use that flexibility to boost infrastructure spending, or by cutting taxes. That might push up government debt levels, but Lipton argues that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth considering. We know that infrastructure investment can be particularly beneficial, not only because it is deeply needed in some advanced economies, but as it has positive spillover effects to the rest of the economy. Raising wages and tax cuts to promote spending can also be effective, particularly in countries that have current account surpluses. These need to be carefully designed and directed to those that are most likely to spend the proceeds. The Bank of England is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153embroiled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Brexit debate following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s punchy session at parliament, says our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Mark Carney described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely unfounded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan and jeopardising its reputation for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Olympian detachment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by emphasising the pros but not the cons of EU membership. Giving evidence to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the governor provided backing for David Cameron by warning that there would be short-term costs to the UK from a decision to leave the EU in June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including weaker investment, lower consumer spending and the relocation of foreign-owned banks to Ireland or continental Europe. Carney said the deal negotiated by Cameron last month had addressed the issues identified by the Bank as necessary to ensure the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary and financial stability. However, Carney had to fend off an attack from Rees-Mogg, who said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneath the dignity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the governor to be making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speculative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comments about the beneficial impact of EU membership. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report Oil prices are continuing their recent recovery, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese export data. Brent crude has hit a new three-month high, up 1.1% at $41.31 per barrel, having broken though the $40 mark yesterday. Quite a recovery, from the $27.10 touched in mid-January. Some analysts predict that oil will weaken again, though, given the oversupply issues dogging the market: The 25% tumble in Chinese exports in February continues to loom over the markets. The timing of the Lunar New Year may be a factor, but the underlying theme is that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new growth targets could soon be in trouble. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, reckons Beijing may need to do more to encourage consumer spending, and aid the transition away from manufacturing. This export slump again underlines the huge challenges that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export-driven model is facing and how domestic demand needs to grow to take up the slack in order to maintain the growth momentum. If this does not happen, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is likely to slow considerably and be below the 6.5% target set by the government this week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grilling has ended, after the governor warned that Brexit was the biggest single \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domestic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. If you missed it, Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog has all the details: European finance ministers looked in good spirits this morning, as they gathered for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECOFIN meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the eurogroup of euzone finance ministers, even indulged in a little light horseplay with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Euclid Tsakalotos. We trust this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new negotiating strategy with Athens.... Ouch. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small firms have suffered a drop in confidence last month, according to new data from the US. Fears over sales growth have hit spending plans, and deterred firms from taking on new staff, according to the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Its optimism index has dipped to 92.9, from 94.2 in January, with every measure of confidence deteriorating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a massive slump. However, it does suggest that economic conditions in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy may have deteriorated in February. Talk of global downturns, and the sight of shares sliding on Wall Street, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped. Some theories are just too good to not be true. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a prime example. Some experts reckon the iron ore price surged 19% yesterday because China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horticulture industry wants steel mills to shut down. For five months. That would stop them pumping pollution into the sky, and mean their upcoming garden show would enjoy nice sunny skies, not clouds of smog. By parliamentary standards, the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session on the EU referendum is a real punch-up. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, kicked the session off by insisting that that the BoE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t making a recommendation on Brexit. But he swiftly got a kicking of his own, from Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, who accused Carney of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speculative pro-EU comments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In between flashing death stares at Rees-Mogg, Carney insisted he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow that claim to stand, as aides wondered whether they should have brought sponges and a towel. In between the sparring, Carney argued that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renegotiated settlement would help the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still being streamed live, here. These charts from Bloomberg show the scale of the Chinese export slump last month: The decline was worryingly broad-based, suggesting a significant tailing off in global demand: Traders are nervous today ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, where fresh stimulus measures could be announced. Fears that Mario Draghi might disappoint the markets (as he did in December) have pushed the euro back above $1.1. Joshua Mahony of IG says this anxiety is being compounded by the poor trade data from China: European stock markets have started the day on a very shaky footing, with the DAX in particular falling sharply following a surprisingly bad batch of trade data overnight. Despite the incredible rally in iron ore yesterday, the 25% fall in exports and 14% drop in imports for February prove it pays to be apprehensive about the Chinese growth story for now. With China representing the second largest export market for the eurozone, this continued slowdown will no doubt worry ECB members ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. It is clear markets have learnt their lessons from the December ECB meeting, with euro shorts and DAX longs being closed out ahead of the release. Despite the high likeliness of action from the ECB, there is no guarantee of the direction markets will move and thus traders are unlikely to be as bold this time, after being burnt three months ago. Deposit rate cuts seem the likeliest, yet this is unlikely to appease QE thirsty markets which have proven to be relatively single minded in their view of what represents a satisfactory policy boost. After two hours of trading, European markets are steadily in the red following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rough Chinese trade data. The FTSE 100 is still down around 1%, and there are chunkier losses across the continent where the French CAC and German DAX have both lost around 1.5%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says investors are worried by the 25% year-on-year tumble in Chinese exports last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equity markets are in the red again this morning, with disappointing overnight Chinese trade data showing plunging February exports (-25%) serving to spook investors who are already concerned about the state of global growth. The market reaction is in stark contrast to the habitual cheering about bad data implying more stimulus, and the Lunar New Year may explain the big drop.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bank of England governor Mark Carney has just begun giving evidence to the Treasury committee on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. You can watch it live here. Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the action: Oxford Economics have just issued a new report on the EU referendum. It has found that a vote for Brexit will knock over 1% off the size of the UK economy, and also hit share prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: A scenario run on the Oxford Global Model suggests that Brexit would leave the level of UK GDP 1.3 percentage points lower by Q2 2018 compared with our baseline forecast that the UK votes to stay in the EU. A vote to leave would mainly shock business confidence but consumers would be adversely affected too. Exporters in price-sensitive sectors would benefit from a weaker exchange rate. Market pricing suggests that sterling could initially fall by around 15% before recovering some of its losses, while the heightened uncertainty would also be expected to drive a sharp drop in equity prices in H2 2016. Brexit would present something of a dilemma for policymakers. While a weaker pound would cause inflation to initially spike upwards, we would expect the MPC to look through this and cutBank Rate in order to support activity. And with the UK likely to retain its reputation as a safe haven, this would also see gilt yields stay lower for longer. Weaker growth would also put the Chancellor in breach of the fiscal mandate, though we would expect him to plead extenuating circumstances, rather than tighten policy and potentially exacerbate the slowdown. They also reckon, though, that Britain will vote to stay in the EU. The International Monetary Fund is preparing a report on the impact of Britain voting to leave the European Union. IMF chief Christine Lagarde announced the plan this morning, and also appeared to reveal that it will warn against Brexit. Unions are seeking urgent talks with Npower after the energy company confirmed plans to cut 2,400 jobs. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement comes two days after the news leaked to the press \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and UNISON General Secretary Dave Prentis says staff deserve better. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Npower bosses are compounding the anxiety for staff by refusing to meet the unions nationally to discuss this so-called recovery plan, to talk about how to protect jobs and avoid compulsory redundancies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling for an emergency meeting so we can work jointly on finding a way out of the mess the company currently finds itself in. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The workforce will be hoping that the worst is now behind Npower, and that in future employees are the first to know if jobs are under threat.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The slowdown in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime property market has hit profits at estate agent chain Foxtons. The group, known for its garish Minis and pushy sales techniques, has posted a 2.6% drop in pre-tax profits in 2015. It says property sales transactions levels in London \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained subdued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2015, partly because May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s General Election deterred some buyers. It also warned that the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU membership could hit demand this year, as.... ...it is too early to predict how transaction volumes may be impacted by recent changes to the tax regime and the short term political and economic uncertainty caused by the UK referendum on leaving the European Union. Yesterday an investment firm warned that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-end property market was cooling, partly because so many luxury flats are coming onto the market. German factories have surprised analysts, in a good way, by posted a 3.3% jump in production in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much stronger than expected, and the biggest increase since September 2009. Ralph Solveen, head of economic research at Commerzbank, called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a good start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Germany, but cautioned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that this will start a lasting uptrend.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, German factories reported a 0.1% drop in new orders in January, which could suggest production will be weaker this spring. Fashion chain Burberry is defying today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, though. Its shares jumped by 5%, after it emerged last night that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmystery investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has been quietly snaffling up shares. A takeover battle could be looming, perhaps from a rival luxury brand or even a private equity operation. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets is falling in early trading, as traders get another dose of Chinese angst. The FTSE 100 fell 60 points, or 1%, at the open to hit 6123 points. Mining stocks, who are dependent on emerging markets for growth, are leading the selloff: Conner Campbell says the 25% plunge in Chinese exports has spooked the City. That shocking slide in exports was joined by at similarly weak, if not quite as alarming, 13.8% drop in imports; combine the two together and it is the kind of ugly reminder of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spluttering economy investors certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need at the moment. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some gloomy reaction to the 25% slump in Chinese exports last month, from Reuters. XIAO SHIJUN, ANALYST AT GUODOU SECURITIES, BEIJING February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data is really poor and that will exert depreciation pressure on the yuan. However, the recent lacklustre performance of the U.S. dollar in global markets, together with the Chinese central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to keep the yuan relatively stable for now, means that the yuan will not weaken sharply in the near term. More uncertainties lie in the medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NIE WEN, ANALYST AT HWABAO TRUST IN SHANGHAI \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China will face a more challenging situation in trade this year than 2015. Both imports and exports in February fell more than our expectations. Exports were largely dragged by a weak global demand from both developed and emerging countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more positive take: JULIAN EVANS-PRITCHARD, CHINA ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS IN SNGAPORE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exports were very strong last year in February - up nearly 50 percent - because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big seasonal effect and the implication is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exports were very strong last year in February - up nearly 50 percent - because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big seasonal effect and the implication is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly weak trade data has hit most Asian markets. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei shed 1%, Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng lost 0.7%, and the South Korean Kospi fell 0.75%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own stock markets slumped by 3%, but then curiously rebounded in late trading to close up 0.1%. Traders may be betting that China will take more steps to stimulate its economy, having set a growth rate target of 6.5% or better this year. Fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy are swirling again this morning after it reported that exports shrank by a quarter (!) last month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest slump in seven years, since the depths of the financial crisis, and can only add to concerns that the Chinese economy is suffering a nauseously bumpy hard landing. New government figures showed that exports sank 25.4% year-on-year to $126.1bn last month. Economists has expected a decline of around 14.5%. Imports were also down, but less alarmingly. They fell 13.8% year-on-year, a recovery from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18.8% tumble. The export slump can partly be blamed on the Chinese New Year, which fell earlier in February this year. But the problems surely run deeper than that. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customs office reports that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imports from and exports to major trade partners declined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in February. It cited falling sales of labour-intensive goods, including mechanical and electrical products and apparel. And the slump sent shivers through the markets. Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong, called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another shocker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More stimulus is likely to be needed on both the monetary and fiscal front, and that will argue against the yuan stability China craves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Evan Lucas of IG is also concerned, calling the numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Its February trade surplus of $32.59bn was 36% below estimates as exports collapsed down to 25.4% year-on-year. Chinese Lunar New Year always skews the February numbers; however, the figure is much lower than expected and such a big miss has created some angst. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an edgy time in the markets. Yesterday, we saw the iron ore price surge 20%, and oil rally over $40, a sign of new optimism over growth prospects. But that was countered by a drop in German factory orders, and a fall in investor confidence, indicating the market turbulence which struck in January has caused real damage. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the latest Chinese trade data and a new heathcheck from Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector, for further clues. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be monitoring Greece, after inspectors from its creditors agreed to return to Athens to review its bailout. That long-awaited talk about debt relief could finally be close, once Greece has satisfied its lenders. Also coming up this morning: European finance ministers are gathering in Brussels this morning for an ECOFIN meeting. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will be testifying to MPs about the EU referendum from 9.15am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our Politics Team should be covering that. On the corporate front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest utility, RWE, which is cutting thousands of jobs at its UK division, nPower. Bookmaker Paddy Power and estate agent Foxtons will also be updating the markets.",

                "bodyText":"And finally...the European stock markets have closed slightly higher, as all eyes turn to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting. Mario Draghi is expected to announce new stimulus measures - perhaps deeper negative interest rates, and another splurge of quantitative easing to drag inflation above zero again. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Barbara Teixeira Araujo, economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, say: We believe the ECB will cut its deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.5% and expand its bond-buying program, as the pressure for it to act ramps up amid recent financial turmoil and sluggish growth in the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main economies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ECB president may also attempt one of his famous jawboning sessions to reassure investors, and perhaps weaken the euro. And that leaves investors nervous, having been disappointed in December. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, explains: As John Cleese observed in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClockwise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the despair that gets you, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the hope. Traders have learned the wisdom of that observation over the past three days, as stock markets continue to oscillate in relatively tight ranges. In one sense, this is due entirely to the ECB \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no one wants to get caught out with aggressive positioning ahead of a potentially decisive meeting tomorrow. Either that, or we are simply having to endure the inevitable consolidation period that follows a significant rally. Either way, most investors have opted to sit on their hands. At least now we have fewer than 24 hours to go until we know Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind. So the FTSE 100 has just closed up 20 points, or 0.35%, at 6146. Prudential was the biggest riser, up 2.6%, after it posting a 22% jump in profits and announced a special dividend. Burberry shares were firmly out of fashion. They slumped by 6.7% after it emerged that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t facing a mystery takeover bid after all. And across Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index finished 0.5% higher. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has dropped to just 0.3% in the last three months, according to the latest research from The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). NIESR estimated that growth weakened in the December-February quarter, down from the 0.4% seen in November-January. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a slowdown compared to the 0.5% growth that was officially recorded in the final three months of last year. NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows that the UK economy hit a sticky patch in December, a time when global slowdown fears were rising. It also sees signs that growth picked up since. Jack Meaning, research fellow at NIESR, says: It looks as if output growth at the start of 2016 has been subdued. However, it appears that December 2015 may have been a low point for GDP and as this drops out of the calculation of quarterly growth rates, output growth for the first quarter may strengthen slightly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, is concerned by the slowdown: Back in parliament, Steve Baker MP has accused the Bank of England of being at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sixes and sevens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the Brexit issue, following Clara Furse and Richard Sharp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony today. Baker supports the campaign to leave the EU. Anti-austerity protests are also underway in Athens this afternoon, against the economic reforms contained in the Greek bailout. Two former government ministers who broke away from the government last summer, Panagiotis Lafazanis and Dimitris Stratoulis, are taking part: The Treasury committee is now examining Richard Sharp, ahead of his reappointment to the FPC. Like Dame Clara Furse, Sharp has neglected to mention Brexit in his homework. But he takes a different view - arguing that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a long-term financial instability issue at all, although it will create some volatility. Sharp says There are clearly issues around the Brexit situation. We have seen them manifest themselves in the foreign exchange market, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider them to be fundamental financial stability issues for this nation. That is likely to please the eurosceptic side of the argument, who have claimed that the government is running a Project Fear campaign. Over in parliament, Bank of England policymaker Dame Clara Furse has agreed that the possibility of Britain leaving the EU is a threat to UK financial stability. She told the Treasury committee that: It is clearly true that any significant uncertainty is likely to create disruption, and that disruption creates risks. It also creates opportunities, but it creates risk. And in the short term, that seems to be the case. Dame Clara was being quizzed by the Treasury committee ahead of her re-appointment to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with ensuring financial stability. However, committee chair Andrew Tyrie isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed that Brexit didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually appear on the list of risks gave to the committee in her written evidence. Why wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it there? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all a little awkward, with Dame Clare eventually admitting that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I shall think more carefully next time I put in a written submission\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also denies being influenced by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, where BoE governor Mark Carney said Brexit was the biggest single domestic threat to the recovery. You can watch the session live, here. Over in France, transport unions and youth groups have been holding demonstrations and a strike against the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour reforms. Crowds took to the streets in scores of cities to protest against proposals to amend France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 35-hour working week. There was a big turnout in Marseille: In Paris, several schools were blocked off by students who set up barricades with garbage cans. Associated Press has more details: Outside the Helene Boucher high school, students cheered any mention of how the movement would prevent Hollande and the government from passing the bill. Maryanne Gicquel, a spokesperson for the FIDL student union, described young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journey towards a stable job as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a succession of internships and poorly paid jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being told that it will be easier for companies to lay off workers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The Wall Street Journal has a good take on the Burberry takeover bid that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Saabira Chaudhuri writes: Who is the mystery Burberry Group investor? There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one. The takeover speculation that drove the British luxury retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares 6.6% higher on Tuesday turned out to be mistaken, according to a person familiar with the matter, sending the stock tumbling in Wednesday trading. The shares had soared after a Financial Times article reported on a routine shareholder filing made in February, showing that HSBC Holdings PLC had accrued a stake of more than 5% in Burberry on behalf of what appeared to be an undisclosed investor. That fueled speculation about a possible takeover bid or activist investment. Burberry asked HSBC for the investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity and was waiting on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. On Wednesday, the person familiar with the matter said Burberry had learned that the stake had been accumulated by several HSBC entities on behalf of multiple, separate investors, triggering the 5% threshold. More here: Shares in Burberry have slumped by over 5%, as the takeover talk that gripped the City yesterday deflates. That wipes out all yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally: Rumours that fashion house Burberry might be facing a takeover battle appear to be unfounded. Burberry has been scrambling to protect itself against a mysterious predator, after it emerged that HSBC was holding a 5% stake in the company. This looked like a takeover bid could be looming. But now, HSBC has revealed that this stake is actually made up of several smaller bundles of shares it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holding for a few different clients. The FT has more details: One person close to Burberry said the company was informed on Tuesday that the unusual surge in HSBC holdings was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business as usual trading\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and described the nature of the investors as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153institutional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Another person said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multiple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investors. Burberry and HSBC declined to comment. More well-heeled readers can cancel their private jet orders, because Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has got them covered. His budget airline, Ryanair, has today announced plans for a new corporate jet operation, as my colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The budget airline will offer fine dining on a Boeing 737-700 jet refitted to seat 60 passengers on reclining business class seats. A spokesman said the plane can be hired by the hour, with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153competitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate depending on the arrival and departure airports. Ryanair said the jet would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ideal for private corporate, sports team or group travel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked if Ryanair would accept booking from stag and hen dos, a spokesperson said the carrier was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy to provide quotes for any groups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After all, nothing says luxury like a bunch of lads necking J\u00c3\u00a4gerbombs at 20,000 feet (I imagine). More here: The Economist Intelligence Unit is gloomier about China today, following dire-looking trade date earlier this week: Wall Street shares are expected to rise when trading begins, at 2.3opm GMT/8.30am East Coast time. After a subdued start, European stock markets are now positive, partly thanks to the rise in UK manufacturing output. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation: FTSE 100: up 35 points at 6160, +0.6% German DAX: up 112 points at 9805, + 1.1% French CAC: up 45 points at 4449, + 1% Investors are also anticipating fresh stimulus measures from the European Central bank tomorrow, as Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell explains: It is interesting that the French index kept in-step with its German counterpart, since the Banque de France cut its growth forecasts to 0.3% for the quarter this morning following a factory sentiment slump. Arguably, however, that news merely puts more pressure on Mario Draghi ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, investors hoping for a multi-faceted approach to stimulus (and not a damp squib like last December) from the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank. The oil price is pushing up this morning, following reports that crude producers are planning a meeting. Brent crude has gained 1.7% to $40.34, after an Iraqi oil official told state newspaper Al-Sabah that OPEC and non-OPEC members are going to gather in Moscow. They could potentially discuss freezing output. Mike Ashley, the boss of Sports Direct, has been ordered to testify to the House of Commons over the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of its staff. The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee has warned Ashley that, unless he appears, he would be found in contempt of parliament. That could, in theory, mean he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be jailed*. BIS decided in December to question Ashley, following the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exposure of working practices at Sport Direct. Ashley hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accepted any of the dates offered by the committee..... and now Iain Wright, chair of the committee, has told him to find a window in his diary within two weeks, or else.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full letter (which is online here) I am writing on behalf of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee to establish whether you will accept the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invitation to give evidence to it at Westminster. The Committee would like to hear about the action that you have taken in response to reports in the media about the treatment ofworkers at Sports Direct and about the scope, progress and timetable of your own review of working practices that you announced in December. The treatment of low paid workers and enforcement of the national minimum wage are issues that the Committee will be keeping under review over the coming months. The Committee noted your invitation to attend a meeting at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premises at Shirebrook. In line with select committees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commitment to transparency, it is normal practice for the BIS Committee to meet in public at Westminster and we agreed to adhere to this practice on this occasion. A number of alternative dates have been offered to you by the Committee Clerk, but as yet you have not accepted any of them, nor agreed in principle to attend. As you will be aware, select committees do not normally need to have recourse to our formal powers to summon witnesses in order to secure attendance; refusal to attend without good reason may be considered a contempt of the House. Should you fail in your reply to agree to attend on one of the dates offered to you, or a mutually convenient alternative before 1 June, the Committee reserves the right to take the matter further, including seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt. In the interests of transparency, I may make this letter publicly available, and also your subsequent reply, which I would ask that we receive by 21 March. * Update: The consequences of being in contempt of parliament are not completely clear. Back in 1880, one Charles Grissell was locked up in the House of Commons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 belltower for the offence. But no-one has fallen foul of the law for decades, so the powers are effectively untested in recent times. But the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green paper on parliamentary privilege, published in 2012, said: [Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] power to punish non-members for contempt is untested in recent times. In theory, both houses can summon a person to the bar of the house to reprimand them or order a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imprisonment. Unions have warned that British workers are getting a raw deal, after the number of people on zero-hours contracts jumped again. New government figures show that 801,000 people were on contracts that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee a minimum number of hours work each week. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 697,000 six months earlier. Around one in three people on a zero-hours contract wanted to work more hours, with most wanting them in their current job, the ONS added. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is currently just 5.1%, which ought to put workers in a strong position. Instead, employers still seem to be calling the shots. TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says workers without guaranteed hours need more support: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Zero-hours contracts may be a dream for cost-cutting employers, but they can be a nightmare for workers. Many people on zero-hours contracts are unable to plan for their future and regularly struggle with paying bills and having a decent family life. The so-called flexibility these contracts offer is far too one-sided. Staff without guaranteed pay have much less power to stand up for their rights and often feel afraid to turn down shifts in case they fall out of favour with their boss. The European Union is proposing better rights for zero-hours workers - another reason why workers should be worried about the risks of Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd British manufacturers did extremely well to boost output by 0.7% in January, given the global turmoil. So says Mark Stephenson, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The challenges UK manufacturers are up against should not be underestimated. Slow global economic growth, weak Chinese trade data, downgraded UK growth forecasts, turmoil in the steel industry and the PMI at its lowest point for almost three years, are just some of the factors at play. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing output figures show how resilient the industry is and signals the prospect of a more positive year ahead for UK manufacturers. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EEF survey highlighted that firms expect modest growth in the coming months, and a weakened pound should boost many exporters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This rather retailed chart confirms UK manufacturing picked up in January, while the mining and energy sector was notably weak: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has burst back to growth. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% month-on-month in January, according to the new report from the Office for National Statistics. That follows three months of falling output and also beats City forecasts, with economists expecting an increase of just 0.2%. Firms making plastic, metal and rubber products all reported that output rose during the month, and there was also a big rise in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmanufacturing and repair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 section of the report. It looks like a decent sign, says Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners: Given fresh concerns over what a potential Brexit could do for large UK corporate companies, the strong recovery seen this morning for January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Manufacturing Sector - recording 0.5% above analyst forecasts - will be a huge relief and welcome news for Bank of England governor Mark Carney. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news. Manufacturing output is still 0.1% smaller than a year ago. And wider measure of industrial production only rose by 0.3%, and was dragged down by a fall in mining, crude oil and gas production. The gloom swirling over France has darkened this morning. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has cut its growth forecast for the current quarter, after finding a big fall in confidence among factory bosses. Bloomberg has the story: Sentiment among factory executives dropped to 98 in February from 101 in January, its biggest decline since January 2013, according to a monthly survey from the central bank. As a result, the economy will expand 0.3% this quarter instead of 0.4%, the Bank of France said on Wednesday. The drop in confidence is a significant indication that a slowdown in emerging-market economies such as China and Brazil is spilling over into Europe and may threaten France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first real recovery since President Francois Hollande came to power in May 2012. The political storm swirling over Bank of England governor Mark Carney has intensified this morning, with one MP suggesting he should consider resigning. Carney has irked the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurosceptic wing (not a difficult task, to be fair) by warning yesterday that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could suffer if it left the EU. He suggested some banks could move jobs overseas, while consumer spending and house prices could be hit. The governor insisted that the Bank wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t making any recommendation about Brexit, but that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced Sir Peter Bone. Bone told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme that Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was speculating, and speculating in a way that I say is wholly unbelievable. It seemed to be part of the Project Fear. I guess it was orchestrated by conversations either with the Chancellor or the Prime Minister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the governor had speculated that way that we should come out of the EU, do you think Downing Street wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be clamouring for his head at the moment?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bone is one of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more colourful backbenchers, famous for often telling the House of Commons what (the long-suffering) Mrs Bone thinks about the affairs of the nation. So Carney may not be packing his bags quite yet..... Insurance firm Prudential has just cheered the City by announcing a 22% jump in operating profits. Investors are going to be quids in -- the Pru is raising its dividend by 5%, and paying a special divi of 10p as well. The company is also arguing that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too pessimistic about the Asian emerging markets, where it is a big player. European stock markets have made a mixed start to trading, after seeing Asia hit a one-week low overnight. Mining shares are mostly down in the City, reflecting concerns over China. And the Restaurant Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downbeat results statement has also hit sentiment. Despite the recent market turbulence, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier luxury chocolate maker has decided to float on the London exchange. Hotel Chocolat is hoping to raise \u00c2\u00a350m by entering the AIM Market. The company already runs 84 shops, a tasting club with 70,000 members, and its own cocoa plantation on St Lucia. It now plans to expand its British chocolate manufacturing, and invest in in new stores and its digital operations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the announcement. Kit Juckes, top foreign exchange strategist at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, has an interesting take on the state of the markets. He told clients this morning: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help reflecting that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still living with the consequences of the twin bubbles - credit and commodities - that were unleashed by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absurdly easy monetary policy in 2003. The credit bubble burst in 2008 and prompted even easier policy, as well as QE. That drove bond yields down and gave the commodity bubble a fresh lease of life, but when that too burst, we got commodity price deflation to go with the low yields and the result is they are even lower. Investors are left hunting for yield by buying emerging market or high-yield bonds as soon as there is any semblance of calm, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that the over-riding mood is so fragile. And while all this is going on, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic re-balancing is still progressing at a glacial pace, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is hamstrung by a broken financial transmission mechanism and an inability to ease fiscal policy, and the US is stuck in post-GFC second gear, with 2% growth in wages, employment and GDP but not prospect of an acceleration that would provide comfort for emerging market economies. All of this leaves markets subject to mood swings such as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thin gruel for investors in the Restaurant Group today. Shares in the company have tumbled 15% at the start of trading, after it warned the City this morning that like-for-like sales are down by 1.5% so far this year. And it also cautioned that trading will remain tricks at its outlets, which includes the Frankie &amp; Benny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Chiquito chains, plus eateries at various airports. The more challenging trading conditions we saw at the end of last year have continued into the early part of 2016, reflecting a softening in consumer demand and weaker overall consumer confidence. Whilst still early in the year, our assessment is that this more challenging environment and recent trading patterns are likely to persist. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push into renewable energy has driven its utility giant E.ON into a record loss. E.ON reported a net loss of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn for 2015, after writing billions off the value of its power plants. It also warned that 2016 will be tough too, due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153structural transformations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy industry. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nathalie Thomas explains: Germany is aiming to generate 80 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by 2050, up from around a quarter today. But government subsidies for renewables have led to an increase in power generation which has caused wholesale prices to tumble, eroding profitability at the utility companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 coal and gas-fired power stations. Worries over the Chinese economy have weighed on Asian stock markets overnight. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly weak trade data, which showed a 25% tumble in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports in February, hit many shares on the Shanghai stock market. Reuters has the details: China stocks dropped more than 1% on Wednesday, snapping a six-session winning streak, as a tumble in commodity prices hit resource shares and prompted profit-taking amid signs of persistent lethargy in the economy. The blue-chip CSI300 index declined 1.2%, to 3,071.91, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.3%, to 2,862.56 points, registering their first losses in seven sessions. All sectors, with the exception of banks, lost ground as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse-than-expected February trade data revived concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic health. An index tracking resource businesses tumbled 5.3 percent, while the energy sector slumped 3.6 percent. Investors dumped index heavyweights such as Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel Co and Sinopec on lower raw material and oil prices. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei also fell by almost 1%, while Hong Kong is also in the red in late trading. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fragile feel in the air in the City today - along with a LOT of rain - after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barrage of gloomy news. The 25% slump in Chinese exports, allied to another warning from the IMF about economic risks, have punctured the optimism that had been building in the last couple of weeks. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Citigroup has created extra anxiety, by warning last night that revenues this quarter will be sharply below forecasts. And with the oil price falling back below $40 last night, we can all expect more volatility as 2016 shapes up to be an edgy and uncertain year. We get a new healthcheck on the UK manufacturing sector this morning, when the latest industrial production data is released at 9.30am. Economists are hoping for a decent report, as CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson explains: The manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the global economic slowdown over the past few months and once again the UK economy is in the cross hairs today with the latest ONS manufacturing and industrial production data for January. December was an extremely disappointing month with sharp declines in both as 2015 came to a disappointing end. The expectation is for a rebound in January with a 0.4% rise in industrial production, and a 0.2% rise in manufacturing production This would be in line with a similar improvement seen in the January PMI numbers, but could well prove only temporary given the sharp drop seen in the February PMI data. Otherwise, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too much afoot, although tensions are building ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda: 9.30am: UK industrial and manufacturing report for January 3pm: Canadian central bank interest rate decision 3pm: NIESR publishes its latest estimate of UK growth in the last three months And on the corporate front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from Germany utility firm E.ON, security firm G4S and eating out chain the Restaurant Group.",

Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect. This time there were no half measures.</p> <p>The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies.</p> <p>And still it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need for any further cuts in interest rates...</p> <p>Draghi knows that monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c interest rates, quantitative easing and incentives to borrow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only do so much.

Indeed, at the time of writing, the euro was actually stronger against the dollar (about $1.115) than before the stimulus was communicated....</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between our view of the prospects for monetary policy in the US and what is currently discounted in the markets. Our forecast is that rising inflation will prompt the Fed to raise its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 1.0-1.25% by year-end (from 0.25-0.5% now), whereas the implied rate of the December federal funds futures contract is currently only around 0.65%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e1a22de4b0cce0ec5658bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-10T16:38:02.282Z\">4.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">George Magnus: Helicopter money could be next</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>By \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthrowing the kitchen sink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, the European Central Bank may have moved closer to the point where it has to actually start showering cash on the economy.</strong></p> <p>So argues George Magnus, an experienced City voice who used to be head economist at UBS.</p> <p>He argues that the market reaction shows investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of interest rate cuts, cheap loans and a beefier asset purchase scheme will work. </p> <p>So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left?

                "bodyText":"A surge in stock markets and a slump in the euro as the European Central Bank announced its new stimulus measures soon went into reverse after the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Mario Draghi suggested that might be all there was. With another slide in the oil price as hopes of a meeting of producers to tackle the glut began to fade again, it ended up being a volatile day for investors. So markets suffered turnarounds of several hundred points, and the euro saw a more than 3% jump from its lows to its highs against the dollar. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 1oo finished down 109.62 points or 1.78% at 6036.70 after earlier hitting 6203 The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.77% to 1311.74 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 2.3% to 9498.15, after peaking at 9995 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.7% lower at 4350.35 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 0.5% at 18,118.23 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bucked the trend and ended up 0.07% at 8766.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 555.7 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points or 0.8%. The euro is currently at $1.1214, having earlier fallen as low as $1.0820. It started the day at $1.0997. Meanwhile Brent crude is down 2.5% at $40.01 a barrel, off its worst level of $39.63. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again tomorrow. The eurozone needs reforms and fiscal measures alongside the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package if its economy is to recover, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott: For most of its short life, the European Central Bank fretted about inflation being too high. Now it has the opposite concern. The fear of deflation explains the package of measures announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect. This time there were no half measures. The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies. And still it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need for any further cuts in interest rates... Draghi knows that monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c interest rates, quantitative easing and incentives to borrow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only do so much. He would like his actions to be supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy. His full analysis is here: Mario Draghi shot down his own bazooka, suggests Philip Shaw at Investec: The announcement of the package resulted in a significant fall in the euro (by a cent and a half to $1.0825) and a rally in stocks and bonds. However this was more than reversed when Mr Draghi hinted that rates may have hit the bottom. Indeed he explained that another reason for avoiding a tiered structure was so not to signal that rates could go as low as the ECB wanted. To us this is the worst of both worlds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c taking the deposit rate further below zero but with verbal interventions unwinding positive market effects. Overall we welcome the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to act to bolster the recovery and to help to achieve its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbelow, but close to 2%\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, inflation target. The package of measures is certainly substantial. However we remain wary of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunintended consequences\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the banks arising from negative rates. Moreover at least we judge Mr Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on interest rate prospects has have been unhelpful, especially if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction is not unwound. As well as the volatility after the ECB announcement, markets have also been rattled by another slump in the oil price, as reports cast doubt on whether a meeting between producers later this month would go ahead. Opec and other producers were expected to meet in Russia on March 20 amid a glut of supply and falling demand which has put severe pressure on the crude price. But with Iran reluctant to join a proposal to freeze output at January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels, Reuters is reporting that the gathering in Russia may not take place. That has helped push oil lower once more, with Brent crude down 3% to $39.81 a barrel. Despite the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in the euro after the ECB meeting, Capital Economics still reckons it will fall back against the dollar, mainly because the US Federal Reserve is on the path of raising interest rates. The research group said: The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience in the face of greater-than-expected stimulus from the ECB does not alter our view that the currency is likely to fall towards parity against the dollar later this year. This is because that view has been, and continues to be, primarily driven by our forecast that the Fed will tighten policy much more aggressively than anticipated by the average investor. Although the euro initially slid to around $1.085 in response the announcement of greater-than-expected stimulus from the ECB, the currency subsequently rebounded as Mario Draghi suggested in his press conference that he did not envisage interest rates being cut even further. Indeed, at the time of writing, the euro was actually stronger against the dollar (about $1.115) than before the stimulus was communicated.... There is a stark contrast between our view of the prospects for monetary policy in the US and what is currently discounted in the markets. Our forecast is that rising inflation will prompt the Fed to raise its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 1.0-1.25% by year-end (from 0.25-0.5% now), whereas the implied rate of the December federal funds futures contract is currently only around 0.65%. By \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthrowing the kitchen sink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, the European Central Bank may have moved closer to the point where it has to actually start showering cash on the economy. So argues George Magnus, an experienced City voice who used to be head economist at UBS. He argues that the market reaction shows investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of interest rate cuts, cheap loans and a beefier asset purchase scheme will work. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left? Free money, effectively. Magnus writes: So is the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arsenal now bare? If it sticks to the general approach to policy it has currently then yes. But, though this is inconceivable as thing stand, there are things the ECB could theoretically do. It could take us towards Milton Friedman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153helicopter money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This would involve the ECB taking a more direct role in creating money that might be distributed directly to households, companies and banks, for example by buying loans from banks, or public debt directly from governments, or financing cash distributions in the form of tax cuts or investment allowances. These ideas will remain the subject of idle chatter for the time being. But eventually, who knows? If today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen sink episode ends with a whimper, as seems likely, and governments continue to stand aside from the economic fray, Europeans may demand still more of their central bank. On the same theme Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Draghi did the hard work of convincing an apparently divided group of European central bankers that a bazooka was needed but committed the cardinal central banker sin of signalling a possible end to what is essentially an open-ended program. The markets are blowing a loud raspberry towards the European Central Bank headquarters. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has now shed 64 points, or more than 1%, to 6082 in late trading. European markets are also in the red, having surged over 2% when the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate cuts were announced. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says Mario Draghi is to blame, for telling reporters that further interest rate cuts are unlikely. The ECB president managed to trip himself up in the press conference Q&amp;A session. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of ECB measures is a solid reaction to the recent economic downturn. The markets may be volatile now, but the verdict of the real economy is what matters. Kernohan says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having been stung in December by disappointing market expectations, it was important that Mr. Draghi did not make the same mistake twice. Since then, we have seen a major spike in financial market volatility, a fall in Eurozone inflation, some weakness in the main Eurozone business surveys and cuts to global growth forecasts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement more than met expectations for policy easing, with a cut in the refi and deposit rates, a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn increase in monthly QE purchases, purchases of corporates bonds, and a new Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) arrangement. The addition of non-bank corporate bond purchases and the new LTROs, where borrowing can be as low as the deposit rate, were perhaps the main surprises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The initial reaction of markets was very clear, the Euro fell sharply and equities rallied. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment at the press conference that he thought further rate cuts were now unlikely, reversed this initial reaction. Looking through these very short term reactions however, the proof of the pudding will be a rise in Eurozone inflation expectations and a further pick up in lending growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some market reaction from Reuters: Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital, said Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks that more rate cuts were unlikely caught investors, who were heavily selling the euro by surprise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, regardless of the short term reaction, we see the stimulus package as very important,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking index remained up by 4 percent.  . David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments, believes that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battle against deflation has just replaced Brexit as the biggest issue in Europe. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of fresh measures: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe man who once shared a nickname with a pixellated plumber has thrown the kitchen sink at stimulating the Eurozone economy. Super Mario has morphed into Drastic Draghi. The scale and duration of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money printing programme alone would have been enough to prompt a big intake of breath from the markets. But coupled with the slashing of the interest rate - which effectively means the ECB will be paying banks to lend to consumers - this is a breathtakingly bold burst of monetary policy. The ECB is clearly deeply concerned at the threat of deflation, and is betting that this huge injection of cash into the ailing Eurozone economy will stop the rot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe Euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Its initial plunge was reversed during Mr Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, and his hints that further interest rate cuts are off the table. It took a lot to trump the uncertainty caused by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit saga - but the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desperate throw of the dice has made all other European issues look like a sideshow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mario Draghi didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too happy as he left today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, has warned that investors may not be convinced by this latest eurozone stimulus plan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bold announcements by the ECB was a far more extensive programme than what was expected, and just shows the immense pressure on Draghi to demonstrate the ECB has got to grips with what is an increasingly worrying economic picture. The stimulus should theoretically boost economic activity, however investors are understandably reluctant about making this presumption given low global growth, global deflationary pressures and poor demand for credit in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement is now online: Introductory statement to the press conference Research group Teneo Intelligence have turned it into a word cloud: There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong argument\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the ECB has fired its bazooka today, says Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. He adds that the new measures to boost bank lending should help the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling periphery: Considering that only four Euro-Zone countries are on the wrong side of the net-borrowing/lending equation vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the European Central Bank and National Central Banks (per Bank of Spain and Wall Street Journal), these new measures are most likely going to help reduce financial credit risk in Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal more than anywhere else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bank shares are soaring following the news that the ECB will give them ultra-cheap loans: So, a quick recap. The European Central Bank has slashed interest rates to fresh record lows, in its latest attempt to prevent the eurozone slumping into a Japan-style deflationary slump. The headline borrowing cost is now zero, while banks are being forced to pay 0.4% for leaving cash at the ECB. It took the move after slashing its growth and inflation forecasts. It now expects inflation to average just 0.1% this year, and warns that growth risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the downside\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ECB chief Mario Draghi said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crucial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to get inflation close to target without undue delay, and warned that: The economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The ECB is widening its QE programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month, and will also start buying up debt issued by companies. It says the plan will help get inflation back to target, eventually. It is also offering new, very cheap four-year loans to banks. Those loans could effectively see the ECB pay banks (!) to lend to the real economy. The euro initially plunged on the news, but then rallied sharply after Mario Draghi, ECB president, said the bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to cut interest rates further. That could disappoint the ECB (although they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never officially launch a currency war.....) Mario Draghi also told reporters that: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoverwhelmingly backed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the governing council (ie, not unanimous). He described \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchelicopter money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinteresting concept\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, rather than ruling out dumping cash on eurozone citizens if needed. He denied \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcover-reacting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to recent poor data, insisting that economic conditions merited the new slug of measures. He rejected concerns that negative interest rates are harming the banking sector, by hurting profitability And he insisted that the ECB mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give up the fight against deflation Our City editor Jill Treanor has written a Q&amp;A explaining what the ECB has announced today, and why: And finally, Draghi insists that the eurozone is not in deflation (even though prices are currently falling). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do a quick summary now, and mop up the best expert reaction. Draghi then repeats his statement that the ECB doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to cut interest rates again, and emphasises that the facts could change. Has someone slipped him a note about the soaring euro? Q: Could the ECB consider \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchelicoptor money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if the new measures announced today don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have their necessary effect? Draghi replies that the idea is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interesting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and being studied by academics but the European Central Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really studied the concept yet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Helicopter money is the idea of showing cash on the public to encourage them to spend, thus pushing prices up. The wild swings in the euro in the last 90 minutes show that the markets really aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what to make of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcements. Draghi has also insisted that the ECB can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply wilt in the face of low inflation and weakening growth: Q: Given that the fall in inflation is mainly due to cheaper oil, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the ECB over-reacted? No, Mario Draghi insists. The global economic picture has worsened since December, and financial conditions have changed considerably since This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an over-reaction to the oil price. It is an adequate reaction to the weakening in the growth and price stability prospects. Q: Are central bankers running out of ammunition? Draghi replies that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list of measures announced today shows that this is not the case.. Francesco Papadia, a former director general for Market Operations at the European Central Bank, tweets that Draghi may have undermined his own stimulus programme: Presumably today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was NOT unanimous, otherwise Draghi would have said as much. Q: Did the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council unanimously support today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions? Draghi replies that the majority in favour has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoverwhelming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also claims that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish representative, Jens Weidmann, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a vote this month (because of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrotating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 voting system). Everyone gets to express their view. Oh. Dear. The euro has reversed its early fall and is now UP 1% against the US dollar. Traders are reacting to Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement that interest rates aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to be cut again. They may also be calculating that the ECB has no more weapons in its toolkit. You can only throw the kitchen sink once. Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, says the ECB has launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the eurozone weak inflation rate, by using all the tools at its disposal. He says it will unleash up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800bn of commercal bank reserves, which is currently locked up in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronic vaults: While the bank has revealed its policy instruments step by step in the past, now it announced all of them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcutting the interest rates, expanding the QE program and providing long-term liquidity\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtogether. This massive easing package should release as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 billion parked at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deposit facility and reserves, increasing inflation closer to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target through higher lending and a weaker euro. Reinhard Cluse, chief European economist at UBS, says the European Central Bank has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcover-delivered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today. The ECB delivered a stronger-than-expected policy response today. We were on the dovish side of expectations anticipating a large increase in QE and the inclusion of corporate bonds within the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase spectrum. However, the decision surpasses our dovish expectations. He also expects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risky assets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including investment-grade corporate bonds, peripheral eurozone government debt, bank credit and stocks to all benefit. Good news for investors who own them. The euro has bounced back, after Draghi said that the ECB doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate cutting interest rates again (although you never know). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for traders who have been shorting the euro.... Draghi says the decision to impose negative interest rates on eurozone banks has worked well. He claims it has not hurt the banking sector overall (despite analysts arguing that it has hurt profitability) But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the ECB can impose deeper and deeper negative interest rates, he adds. Onto questions. Q: How low can the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rates go? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Mario Draghi. We do not anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce interest rates further..... of course, new facts can change the picture, he adds. Draghi ends his statement by urging eurozone governments to use the window of opportunity provided by the ECB to reform their economies. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majority of euro area governments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd need to speed up their efforts, he says. Draghi always ends his press conference statements with this sort of statement. The message doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always get through. The euro has fallen to its lowest level in six weeks against the dollar, down 1.6% on the day to $1.0825. The ECB has lowered its growth forecasts, Draghi says. He blames lower global growth prospects, and cautious that risks are now to the downside (never a good message). It now expects growth of just 1.4% this year, down from 1.7% three months ago. And the ECB has slashed its forecast for inflation this year to almost zero, from 1% earlier. Inflation will probably remain negative for the next few months, Draghi says, before recovering later this year. Interest rates are going to stay at their current record lows, or lower, for a long time, says Draghi: Some reaction to that last point: Mario Draghi also confirms the ECB will launch four new refinancing operations - offering extremely cheap four-year loans to banks. He also confirms that these loans could be as cheap as the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deposit rate, which has been cut to minus 0.4% today. As explained earlier, that means the ECB will be paying the banks to lend them money (!). Draghi has a small surprise - the ECB will now buy up to 50% of a particular bond type though its QE programme (previously it was limited to 33%). Draghi begins by says the ECB governing council has conducted a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthorough review\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the monetary situation in the eurozone. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it has drawn up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comprehensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd group of policies, he continues. They will help the economic recovery, and accelerate the return of inflation to close to, but below 2% (from -0.2% today). He confirms that the headline interest rate has been cut to zero, and that ECB has boosted its QE asset-purchase programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month (from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn). And expanded it to include investment-grade corporate bonds. This programme will run until March 2017, or longer if needed to get inflation on target. ECB president Mario Draghi has arrived. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll read out a prepared statement, and then take questions. There will be lots, we promise. Mario Draghi is about to give a press conference to explain the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. You can watch it live here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also embedded it in the top of this liveblog - just click the play button. The European Central Bank has cut interest rates in the eurozone to zero, expanded its money printing programme and reduced a key deposit rate further into negative territory as it seeks to revive the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and fend off deflation. Going further than economists had expected, the ECB cut the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refinancing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate from 0.05% to zero, prompting a sharp drop in the euro against the dollar. The central bank also cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%, it said in a statement. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight. The ECB also expanded its quantitative easing programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn (\u00c2\u00a361bn) a month, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn. ECB chief, Mario Draghi, had already indicated the central bank would announce fresh stimulus at the conclusion of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-setting meeting. Economists had widely expected the ECB to expand its quantitative easing programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201cand to cut the deposit rate. The Frankfurt-based central bank had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagging economy after the single currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February. The ECB just lifted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least parts of a white rabbit out of the hat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, by slashing interest rates and boosting its bond-buying programme, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. But he also questions whether it will work: That was the maximum that the ECB could do, but it will do little to remove doubts about the impact of these measures. European stock markets are soaring, as traders salivate at the prospect of more money pouring into assets from the ECB. The French CAC index has leapt by over 3%, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX not far behind. Alexandra Russell-Oliver of foreign exchange company Caxton FX says the ECB has exceeded expectations today. ECB President Draghi announced more stimulus measures than markets had expected, including a cut to benchmark interest rates from 0.05% to 0.00%, weakening the euro. The ECB has also announced a new long-term bank lending programme, called a TLTRO. It will run for four years, and allow eurozone banks to borrow cheaply from the central bank. Crucially, these loans could be as cheap as the ECB deposit rate - which it has just cut to minus 0.4%! Economists are impressed: (As part of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotating voting policy, the hawkish Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann had no say at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting.) Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, says the ECB is close to the limits of central bank policymaking: Some instant reaction from the Reuters news agency: The ECB is also widening the scope of assets that it will buy through its QE programme. It will now buy investment-grade corporate bonds, on top of the government debt it has been buying with newly minted money for the last year. The pound has surged against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3055. That means one euro is worth 76.5p, down from 77.5p before the announcement. Mario Draghi and the ECB has surprised the market with the cut to zero for the headline interest rate, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co: The ECB cut their headline minimum bid rate to zero from 0.05%. This has taken the market by surprise as we can see from the sharp sell-off in the euro. In addition the ECB have cut their deposit rate by another 0.1% to take it to 0.4% and increased the monthly bond purchases by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 billion. So Mario Draghi has fired the big bazooka and given the market what it wanted and more. It now remains to be seen if this has a lasting impact on risk assets and if the euro will continue to slide. The euro has plunged as investors react to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut interest rates and boost its QE programme. It has fallen from $1.0867 against the US dollar, from $1.097 before the announcement. BREAKING: The European Central Bank has cut the interest rate across the eurozone to a new record low of zero. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big surprise; the rate was previously 0.05%. The ECB has also cut the deposit facility rate deeper into negative territory, to minus 0.4% (from minus 0.3%). That means banks are going to be charged more for leaving cash unused in the electronic vaults, rather than lending it to customers. And in another big move, the ECB has also boosted its quantitative easing programme by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month. That means it will be buying more assets with newly printed money each month, in an attempt to drive inflation above zero. Reaction to follow! Just five minutes to go! And the euro is weakening a little, suggesting investors are expecting fresh action from the ECB. For today to be a success, Mario Draghi needs to reassure investors that the eurozone recovery will continue. So argues Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group in her latest research note. Today is all about Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to convince the market that additional measures could foster the economic recovery and eventually generate inflation. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the scene inside the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Frankfurt: The cost of that HQ reportedly spiralled to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2bn; nice wooden flooring and fancy lights don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come cheap! City traders will be scrambling to the local sandwich shop before the ECB interest rate decision arrives.... Central bankers never admit they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fighting a currency war. But Mario Draghi does have a good opportunity to weaken the single currency today. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says: I think the ECB has an opportunity to push the Euro lower and fight back against deflation. Market positioning is light and sceptical.... The euro is trading around $1.098 against the US dollar right now, down around 0.15%. And one pound is worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2941, meaning the euro is worth 77.2p. Markets would be particularly impressed if the ECB widened its asset purchase scheme today to buy corporate loans and other risky stuff. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, here: Currently, Mario Draghi is mainly buying government bonds. That has driven prices to such record high levels that investors are now paying to hold them, rather than getting a return, because they can be sold onto the ECB. Thank goodness we have gifs to keep us entertained before Mario Draghi appears. This is your 60 minute warning..... just one hour to wait until the ECB reveals whether it has cut interest rates at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting. Any other measures may have to wait until Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, 45 minute later. Wow. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by a blistering 7.8% last year. New figures released by Dublin show that Ireland was the best-performing EU country in 2015, for the second year running. In contrast, the eurozone expanded by around 1.5% last year, while the UK grew by 2.2%. Amazingly, Irish GDP surged by 2.7% in the final quarter of 2015, as businesses and consumers put its debt crisis woes behind them. Personal consumption was up 3%, suggesting more solid domestic demand. For all the talk of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mario Draghi, the ECB president cannot fix all the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. His job, really, is to keep the monetary system working while Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected leaders make the tough decisions. Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal makes this point in the Times today: Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the IMF, has said the ECB should launch fresh stimulus measures today to stimulate growth. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telling Bloomberg TV that the recovery in Europe is too slow. Blanchard also flagged up that commercial bank profits are being eroded by deeper negative rates (as explained earlier) European stock markets have dipped this morning, as investors brace for the ECB decision at 12.45pm GMT. All eyes are on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Frankfurt HQ, as Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: This is seen as an opportunity for President Mario Draghi to redeem himself by putting his money (Germany might say otherwise) where his mouth is and deliver the boost to QE that markets were left wanting for in December. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Handelsblatt newspaper has already fired a warning shot at Mario Draghi. They fear he is endangering Germans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hard-earned savings by hitting banks with negative rates, and by printing more money through QE: Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says the euro will soar and shares will slide if Mario Draghi fails to deliver today: Markets envision at least a 10 basis point reduction [to the deposit rate paid by banks]. If the ECB does not meaningfully exceed their expectations and offer a tangible boost to the size of QE asset purchases, another disappointment is likely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Besides sending the Euro higher, such a result will probably hurt risk appetite. This may see sentiment-geared FX like the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars trade lower alongside share prices while the anti-risk Japanese Yen advances. The European Central Bank began its quantitative easing programme a year ago. Since then, government bond prices have hit record highs, as traders knew they could sell them onto the ECB. Shares, though, have lost ground - hit by global economic concerns, the Greek debt crisis, and even the Volkswagen cheating scandal: Canadian bank RBC have listed four reasons for the ECB to launch fresh stimulus today: headline inflation has slipped back into negative territory measures of underlying price pressures in the euro area - such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inflation -are also trending lower the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own staff forecasts are likely to incorporate significant downward revisions inflation expectations in the euro area are providing a worrying indication that the prolonged period of low inflation is beginning to feed on itself. Some City analysts are worried that the ECB may under-deliver today. French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale predict that that bank deposit rates will be slashed from -0.3% to -.0.5%, but fear that Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warchest is running dry: We expect the ECB to cut the deposit rate by 20bp with some tiering.... There are other options such as a corporate bond purchase programme or expanded collateral eligibility, but these would have limited economic effect Our main concern is that, whilst the bank will continue to signal its willingness to do whatever it takes, we think the ECB is approaching the effective limit of what it can do. Toby Thompson of investment manager Brooks Macdonald also fears disappointment, saying: The ECB is at risk of underwhelming markets by virtue of German intransigence and market over-optimism regarding depth of measures. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s man at the ECB, Jens Weidmann, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a vote at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting (they take it in turn to sit out). But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still be able to influence proceedings. Expectations of a rate cut have already hit the euro, as Bloomberg explains: The euro is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst-performing major currency over the past month with traders bracing for the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on whether to expand stimulus. The single currency has depreciated close to 3 percent against the greenback since Feb. 10 as economists forecast the ECB on Thursday will cut its deposit rate from minus 0.3 percent and step up its 60 billion-euro ($66 billion) monthly bond-buying program. More here: Euro Sinks to World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Worst Performer as ECB Keeps Bears on Edge Another great chart, showing how the markets have absolutely certainty that the ECB will slash the bank deposit rate again today. Two months ago, it was a 50-50 shout, before market turmoil and weak inflation drove up the odds to 100%. This is a great chart, showing City economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As you can see, everyone expects deeper negative rates (but will it be -0.4% or -0.5%?), but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no agreement over the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme. That could be a recipe for volatility once the decisions are announced: The ECB could decide to scrap the deadline on its QE programme (currently March 2017). It could simply pledge to keep buying assets with newly created money until inflation is back on track, as the Resolution Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Duncan Weldon points out: Capital Economics reckons Mario Draghi needs to announce something big today. They are calling for a 20 basis point cut in the deposit rate (to minus 0.5%) and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn of extra quantitative easing each month. The ECB has signalled a further loosening of monetary policy at its forthcoming meeting on 10th March. And while December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under-deliverance highlights the risk of another disappointment, the deteriorating economic outlook should persuade the Governing Council to be bolder this time. The ECB is also expected to downgrade its growth and inflation forecasts today - another reason for fresh action. But Stefan Schneider, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, argues that some economic conditions are actually improving. Fears of a US recession have eased, he tells Bloomberg TV, while the oil price has also picked up (good for inflation) The expectations are that Draghi has to deliver something, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it will be a dramatic move. European bank chiefs are already quietly fuming about the prospect of deeper negative deposit interest rates being announced today. Bankers hate negative deposit rates (which they pay to the ECB) because they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pass them onto consumers. If they did, savers would simply withdraw their money and put it under the mattress. And two senior bankers have gone public, as the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Claire Jones reports: Andreas Treichl, chief executive of Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Erste Bank, told the Financial Times that another cut could encourage financial bubbles, hurt economic growth and create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social disparity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by penalising savers. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Garc\u00c3\u00ada Cantera, Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, added that the banks that would take the biggest hit to their profits if rates were cut again were those least able to bear it. Mario Draghi knows these concerns, of course. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s betting that negative rates will weaken the euro, and drive banks into riskier assets. But this is why some people think a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctiered deposit system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is the way forward, so that banks would pay a lower negative rate on some deposits. More here: Senior European bankers voice concerns over ECB cut Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a list of options which Draghi and the governing council will be pondering in Frankfurt right now: Cut bank deposit rates. The ECB currently forces banks to pay 0.3% on money left in its vaults. It is likely to cut to -0.4%, or even -0.5%, to spur banks to lend to the real economy. Introduce a two-tiered system for bank deposits at the ECB. That would protect banks from the full force of negative interest rates (which eat into their profitability) Boost quantitative easing. The ECB could raise the amount of government bonds it buys each month, by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70bn, or extend it beyond March 2017. Widen QE. The ECB could start buying corporate bonds, or even shares (unlikely!), with newly created money. Talk tough. Mario Draghi could reassure the markets by promising that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arsenal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t empty, and that it could do more. Good morning. Central banking, like Shakespearean acting, relies on great delivery. So Mario Draghi must hope that all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well that ends well when he announces how the European Central Bank will tackle Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall back into deflation. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is widely expected to take the plunge into deeper stimulus measures today, at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Economic growth appears to be stalling, while consumer price inflation turned negative again last month, falling by 0.2%. And eurozone unemployment is still over 10%. Measure for measure, the eurozone isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in great shape. These are classic circumstances for a central banker to ease monetary policy again. And virtually all economists expect fresh action -- such as a new cut to the deposit rate charged which banks pay to the ECB, or a boosted quantitative easing scheme. But the ECB is in a tricky position. Remember, its headline interest rate is already almost zero, it is already imposing negative borrowing costs on banks, and it is already buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of assets each month through QE. And that means investors are nervous. Back in December, Draghi disappointed the markets by not meeting their expectations for more QE. That created quite a tempest, sending the euro soaring (not what the ECB wanted at all). Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big priority is to ensure the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary transmission system is working, so that merchants in Venice (and beyond) can get ready access to affordable credit. So we might get some new measures to prevent negative rates hurting the banking sector. But no-one really knows, which is why today is so dramatic. The markets have already had one central bank shock - overnight, the New Zealand central bank cut rates, sending the NZ dollar tumbling. So will Mario deliver? We find out in five hours time. The ECB decision is announced at 12.45pm GMT, or 1.45pm in Frankfurt Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference begins at 1.30pm GMT. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be tracking other events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. That will include a new review of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (flawed?) energy market, and financial results from UK supermarket chain Morrisons and high street chain Home Retail.",

                "bodyText":"If Labor wins the upcoming federal election, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the economy will come to a shuddering halt and I think the stock market will crash,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peter Dutton has said. It is a significant forecast for a senior cabinet minister to make and one, which if correct, would be a major concern for domestic and foreign investors alike. There are, fortunately, several straightforward ways to test the immigration minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme and extraordinary claims. Importantly, there needs to be an assessment of any changes in the probability of a Labor win at the next election. That must then be benchmarked against what has happened to the stock market, interest rate futures and the value of the Australian dollar over the time the election probabilities have changed. If Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning has any credibility, if Labor is judged to be more likely to win the election, one would see, with certainty, share prices fall, expectations for future interest rate cuts increase and the value of the Australian dollar fall. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look first at recent trends in the probability of a Labor win in the upcoming election. On 22 February, Newspoll showed Labor moving from six points behind the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis to break even at 50-50. This line-ball reading for the major parties was confirmed in the next Newspoll and in recent Essential Research polls. Coincidently, the election betting markets have also showed a move towards Labor in the last few weeks. Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s odds of winning the election are now $5.00, which is in from $6.50 just before the 50-50 Newspoll, while the Coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election-winning odds have widened from $1.11 to $1.17. While the Coalition is still favoured, the odds of a Labor election win and, if Dutton is correct, a stalled economy and a stock market crash have increased in the last few weeks. Making a mockery of Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim is the fact that stocks are going up, the prospects for further interest rate cuts have receded and the Australian dollar has risen very strongly. This is the polar opposite of what one would see in the reaction of financial markets if a stalled economy and stock market crash was about to unfold. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look at stocks first. The ASX200 index has risen by more than 3% since the day before the initial 50-50 Newspoll was released. While many factors have influenced this solid upswing in stock prices, the greater likelihood of a Labor election victory has not driven investors away from the ASX. At the same time, the implied yield on interest rate futures has risen by approximately 15 to 20 basis points (depending on which timeframe is placed on the market pricing), which means the market is now less convinced that interest rate cuts will be needed over the next six to 18 months. In other words, the market pricing is increasingly priced for a stronger economy over the medium term, even as Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of winning the election have materially improved. Now for the Australian dollar. The AUD was trading around US$0.7150 prior to the first 50-50 poll and was 61.4 on a trade-weighted index (TWI). Now, at the time of writing, the AUD has risen to US$0.7500 and about 64 TWI. With the polls and betting markets showing a clear and unarguable move towards Labor in the past few weeks, stocks are up strongly, the extent of future interest rate cuts has been scaled back and the Australian dollar has risen. These are the simple facts. For many reasons, Dutton is embarrassingly wrong. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take my word for it, look at the assessment of global investors and financial market trends, where hundreds of billions of Australian dollars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of bonds, stocks and foreign exchange have traded in the last few weeks. Investors have been buying into Australian assets with gusto, which perhaps, coincidently, has occurred at the same time as Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election prospects have improved.",

First, negative interest rates as a tool of monetary policy are effectively exhausted. Second, asset purchases and credit easing will do the heavy lifting of policy stimulus going forward. And third, the ECB is focused on the domestic credit channel to kick-start growth rather than lowering the euro.</p> <p>While the ECB has yet to provide details on its expanded purchase programme, our initial thoughts are that it will purchase about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 billion in non-financial corporate bonds per month. By adding corporate bonds to its list of government, agency and covered bonds as well as asset-backed securities, the ECB is now firmly in the realm of credit easing.</p> <p>Although we acknowledge the marginal efficacy of monetary policy is declining, we disagree with the view the ECB has run out of ammunition. There remains a large amount of assets outstanding that the ECB could theoretically purchase. And now that it has started with corporate bonds, blue-chip equities are not a far step away, if ever needed. We concur with President Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the question about helicopter money: We think the ECB is a long way from contemplating forms of monetization, and if history is any lesson, investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keen on monetization, either.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full commentary is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://blog.pimco.com/2016/03/10/not-giving-up/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_content=not_giving_up&amp;utm_campaign=pimco_blog\">Not Giving Up</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e2eea1e4b0fe99a64e59d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T16:14:03.992Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK government has <strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-permanent-secretary-to-the-treasury-announced\">announced Tom Scholar as the new permanent secretary to the Treasury:</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/708324786972323840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tom Scholar succeeds Sir Nick Macpherson to one of the most important jobs in Whitehall: Permanent Secretary at HM Treasury.</p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/708324786972323840\">March 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Scholar is currently the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adviser on European and Global Issues and Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat in the Cabinet Office.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T16:15:07.172Z\">at 4.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56e2ec21e4b05e073b780968\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T16:08:39.402Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> This will come as no real surprise, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Bundesbank was opposed to the bigger than expected stimulus package unveiled by ECB president Mario Draghi on Thursday.

In his view, two things in this piece stand out. One he would welcome, the other he finds thoroughly confusing. </p> <ul> <li>A reality check on fiscal policy and structural reform. Constancio points out that there are significant legal and political constraints on the ability of countries to use fiscal policy to stimulate growth. In his words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153countries that could use fiscal space, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; and many that would use it, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The hint that these constraints may be at least a little unhelpful reflects the drift of opinion on this issue we have been seen of late from the leadership of the ECB. What Constancio has to say about structural reform, however, cuts somewhat against the grain. Pointing out that structural reforms tend to be deflationary in the first instance, he states: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Structural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth, but it is difficult to see how they could spur growth significantly in the next two years, especially when the current problem is lack of global demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We agree, and it is refreshing to see the ECB acknowledge this so openly.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why the bound at -0.4%? Having argued that monetary policy has had to step into the void left by other policies, Constancio argues that monetary policy has boosted growth by around two-thirds of a percentage point over the last two years. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all policies have limits. In the case of the instruments, we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility. The reasons are more fundamental than just the effect on banks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At this point Constancio cites a <a href=\"http://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2016/2/28/how-low-can-they-go\">recent blog by Cecchetti and Schoenholtz</a>, before pointing out that bank returns on equity in the Euro area went up in 2015 despite negative rates. But if it is not the impact on bank profitability that sets a limit to the usefulness of negative rates, then what is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reason?</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4bc29872d5a5d41690441bab97ba9cafa3d4689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4bc29872d5a5d41690441bab97ba9cafa3d4689/0_0_4016_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Constancio at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB press conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Constancio at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB press conference</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ARNE\u00c2\u00a0DEDERT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T14:20:28.192Z\">at 2.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56e2bd54e4b0cce0ec5666c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T12:46:39.296Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late recovery overnight - the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down just 5 points after falling nearly 180 points at one stage - was one of the reasons European markets got off to a good start today.</p> <p>And the US futures are suggesting a bright start when trading begins in a couple of hours time, with the Dow forecast to open up around 150 points.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e2b528e4b0cce0ec5666a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T12:10:08.551Z\">12.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning to the UK budget next Wednesday lunchtime, the HSBC analysts say that</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lot has changed since chancellor George Osborne delivered his upbeat autumn statement last November.

Investec economist Chris Hare is wondering whether we will see a more dovish tone from the monetary policy committee.</p> <p>Analysts at HSBC say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The MPC has been sounding remarkably dovish of late. Not as dovish as the rates market, which is now not pricing-in a rate rise until 2020, but dovish nonetheless. Indeed, since the last meeting, the survey data has been disappointing, suggesting the pace of activity in the UK could be slowing. </p> <p>The most recent releases of CPI inflation (February) and wage growth (December) were actually a touch higher than the BoE had expected, and oil prices in sterling terms are up 18% since the last meeting.

                "bodyText":"After Terrible Thursday came Fantastic Friday. Or maybe Freaky Friday, since many commentators were puzzled by the strong recovery today after the slump yesterday which followed ECB president Mario Draghi seemingly playing down further interest rate cuts. Part of the revival came as investors had second thoughts and decided to concentrate on the positive elements of Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, namely the rate cut he did unveil, the plan to buy corporate bonds and the fact the ECB will be paying banks to lend to companies in an effort to boost the flagging eurozone economy. On top of that, markets were buoyed by a rise in crude as the International Energy Agency said the oil price might have bottomed out and hopes grew that producers would come to an agreement to freeze output. Brent is currently up 0.9% at $40.41. With the ECB stimulus measures outweighing the problem of negative interest rates stretching their balance sheets, banks were among the days main gainers with the Euro Stoxx Banks index ended 6.7% higher at 115. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.7% or 103.09 points at 6139.79, albeit down 0.99% on the week, its first weekly fall since the middle of February Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 3.5% to 9831.13 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 3.2% higher at 4492.79 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB soared 4.8% to 18,987.73 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 3.69% at 9090.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 566.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 217 points or 1.2% higher. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week for, among other things, the UK budget and the latest interest rate decisoins from the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: After markets tanked on Thursday it was bounce-back Friday. On the one hand this feels like a bet on central bankers and how far they are willing to go in their pursuit of pumping up the economy. On the other hand it feels like a desperate play; where else do investors put their money to gain a decent income? Markets have given a - belated - vote of confidence to the ECB stimulus package, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: Investors seem more willing to give Mario Draghi the benefit of the doubt today, having sulked yesterday afternoon. Markets in the UK, Europe and the US are racing higher, with the plan apparently being to put the madness of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session firmly behind them. Overall it looks like the ECB has been given a vote of confidence, even if it took 24 hours for the result to come through. The session has been somewhat spoiled as oil has failed to hold on to its gains for the day, but the resilience of crude prices this week has come as a rude shock to those that thought a sell-off would develop. Dip buyers in both equities and crude oil continue to be rewarded for their bravery, so it look like these price moves are set to extend into the second half of March. Brent crude, by the way, is still in positive territory - up 0.8% at $40.37 a barrel -but off its earlier highs of $41.03. Despite concerns that the ECB - and indeed other central banks - might be running out of ammunition in their attempts to stimulate economic growth, this is not the case according to bond manager Pimco. Commenting on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB package Andrew Bosomworth, head of Pimco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portfolio management in Germany, said: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions sent three signals. First, negative interest rates as a tool of monetary policy are effectively exhausted. Second, asset purchases and credit easing will do the heavy lifting of policy stimulus going forward. And third, the ECB is focused on the domestic credit channel to kick-start growth rather than lowering the euro. While the ECB has yet to provide details on its expanded purchase programme, our initial thoughts are that it will purchase about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 billion in non-financial corporate bonds per month. By adding corporate bonds to its list of government, agency and covered bonds as well as asset-backed securities, the ECB is now firmly in the realm of credit easing. Although we acknowledge the marginal efficacy of monetary policy is declining, we disagree with the view the ECB has run out of ammunition. There remains a large amount of assets outstanding that the ECB could theoretically purchase. And now that it has started with corporate bonds, blue-chip equities are not a far step away, if ever needed. We concur with President Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the question about helicopter money: We think the ECB is a long way from contemplating forms of monetization, and if history is any lesson, investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keen on monetization, either. The full commentary is here: Not Giving Up The UK government has announced Tom Scholar as the new permanent secretary to the Treasury: Scholar is currently the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adviser on European and Global Issues and Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. This will come as no real surprise, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Bundesbank was opposed to the bigger than expected stimulus package unveiled by ECB president Mario Draghi on Thursday. It said (\u00c2\u00a3): Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bundesbank opposed the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package as structured Thursday and fears a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doom loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of high market expectations followed by disappointment, people familiar with the matter said. Worth remembering of course that because of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotation policy, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann had no vote at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Meanwhile CNBC has suggested that Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s later comments at the press conference suggesting rates would not fall further could have been an olive branch to dissenters (presumably the Bundesbank). Much of the future direction of the oil price depends on the outcome of any talks between producers to freeze output, says Dougie Youngson, head of oil and gas research at FinnCap: Brent finally broke through $41 a barrel, its highest level since December last year. The key question now is this recent surge sustainable? Forecasts from both the IEA and EIA are showing that non-OPEC production if declining over this year and next. This decline being driven by output losses in Iraq and Nigeria as well as Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post sanction impact not being a large as originally thought. Crucially, US production is now showing monthly declines which may in time lead to a greater dependence upon imports. The IEA is now forecasting that demand will increase by 1.2mmbbl/d this year. We are therefore seeing supply and demand approaching parity which would be very good news for the oil price and would hopefully see prices being more fundamentally driven. So in terms of what is being forecast, things are looking better. However, forecasts can change and I do think that there is quite a lot of hope priced into the oil price on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big freeze\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd idea with Saudi, Russia and a few of the other more junior members of OPEC. We are still awaiting confirmation that the freeze will occur, but this is not expected for a few weeks yet. If as the market expects, the freeze does occur we can hope to see further strengthening of the oil price as we move into the second half of this year. Hope springs eternal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 US markets have followed the lead from Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 179 points or just over 1%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq have also recorded similar percentage gains. The recovery came as investors had second - and more positive - thoughts about the European Central Banks stimulus measures announced on Thursday. A rise in the crude price, with Brent currently up 2% at $40.85, also helped sentiment. The International Energy Agency said today the oil price may have bottomed out, while there are continuing hopes that producers may agree to act to curb the supply glut. In the UK, MPs have criticised a member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee for not mentioning the risks posed by Brexit in her evidence at a hearing for her reappointment. The Treasury committee said Dame Clara Furse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written evidence was a cause for concern, but it still approved her re-appointment, as well as that of Richard Sharp. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: As with her appointment hearing in 2013, parts of Dame Clara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence were a source of concern to the Committee. The Committee was in agreement that Dame Clara did not appear to have taken enough care with her written evidence. The Committee found it surprising that Dame Clara had not only omitted any reference to the financial stability risks posed by Brexit but, when asked why, appeared unable to provide a clear explanation [for neglecting it]. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take on the comments by ECB vice-president today, in the wake of the market volatility caused by president Mario Draghi announcing a bold stimulus package only to undermine it almost immediately by saying that there may be no more rate cuts: The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative deposit rate is facing limits, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Naturally, all policies have limits,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vitor Constancio said in an opinion piece published on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIn defence of Monetary Policy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the case of the instruments we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ECB President Mario Draghi sent the euro and yields on short-term government bonds rallying on Thursday when he said the bank did not anticipate any further rate cut after the ones he had just announced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A succession of scares haunted global markets in the first six weeks of 2016\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one by one these concerns are now being debunked by reality and policy makers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German bank Berenberg. He concludes: China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no hard landing. Oil prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no reason to worry. US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on track. ECB \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good for banks, good for the economy. On the latter point: The ECB did not just exceed expectations with its comprehensive policy package of 10 March. Its new stimulus is designed to ease the much overdone concerns about the banking system. One aspect of the package apparently irritated markets for a while: the ECB increased the penalty for banks to park deposits at the ECB by just 10bp from -0.3% to -0.4% and suggested that it is reluctant to go into more negative territory for rates. But that is good rather than bad news for banks. The ECB more than offset the small extra penalty for excess deposits by its cut in the refi rate, the scaling up of its asset purchases and the very generous design of its new four-year injections of long-term liquidity. The ECB has shown that it will do its utmost to prevent even a whiff of a new banking crisis and get the economy back to trend growth. Do not bet against Draghi.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ECB vice president V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio has published an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opinion piece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the ECB website, entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Defence of Monetary Policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an unusual step the day after an ECB decision. Malcolm Barr at JPMorgan Chase says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall any instances of senior ECB officials putting pen to paper (as opposed to giving interviews) so soon after an ECB decision. In his view, two things in this piece stand out. One he would welcome, the other he finds thoroughly confusing. A reality check on fiscal policy and structural reform. Constancio points out that there are significant legal and political constraints on the ability of countries to use fiscal policy to stimulate growth. In his words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153countries that could use fiscal space, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; and many that would use it, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The hint that these constraints may be at least a little unhelpful reflects the drift of opinion on this issue we have been seen of late from the leadership of the ECB. What Constancio has to say about structural reform, however, cuts somewhat against the grain. Pointing out that structural reforms tend to be deflationary in the first instance, he states: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Structural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth, but it is difficult to see how they could spur growth significantly in the next two years, especially when the current problem is lack of global demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We agree, and it is refreshing to see the ECB acknowledge this so openly. Why the bound at -0.4%? Having argued that monetary policy has had to step into the void left by other policies, Constancio argues that monetary policy has boosted growth by around two-thirds of a percentage point over the last two years. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all policies have limits. In the case of the instruments, we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility. The reasons are more fundamental than just the effect on banks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At this point Constancio cites a recent blog by Cecchetti and Schoenholtz, before pointing out that bank returns on equity in the Euro area went up in 2015 despite negative rates. But if it is not the impact on bank profitability that sets a limit to the usefulness of negative rates, then what is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reason? Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late recovery overnight - the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down just 5 points after falling nearly 180 points at one stage - was one of the reasons European markets got off to a good start today. And the US futures are suggesting a bright start when trading begins in a couple of hours time, with the Dow forecast to open up around 150 points. Turning to the UK budget next Wednesday lunchtime, the HSBC analysts say that A lot has changed since chancellor George Osborne delivered his upbeat autumn statement last November. The pace of growth has slowed somewhat, nominal GDP is lower than we thought it was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks to revisions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even public sector borrowing looks likely to have overshot in the current fiscal year (possibly by around GBP5bn). Complicating matters further, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum looms large. While we had expected the chancellor to be forecasting a boost to revenues from pensions tax reforms, widespread media reports suggest this will no longer be the case. So, if he is to keep to his own ambitious fiscal goals, he will likely have to introduce further cuts, probably to departmental spending. With oil prices back on the rise, he may also see this as his last chance to increase fuel duties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aside from the budget on Wednesday, the other highlight in the UK next week will be the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly meeting. The decision and the meeting minutes will be released at noon on Thursday. The City is not expecting any changes to the Bank rate at 0.5% and the asset buying programme of \u00c2\u00a3375bn. Investec economist Chris Hare is wondering whether we will see a more dovish tone from the monetary policy committee. Analysts at HSBC say: The MPC has been sounding remarkably dovish of late. Not as dovish as the rates market, which is now not pricing-in a rate rise until 2020, but dovish nonetheless. Indeed, since the last meeting, the survey data has been disappointing, suggesting the pace of activity in the UK could be slowing. The most recent releases of CPI inflation (February) and wage growth (December) were actually a touch higher than the BoE had expected, and oil prices in sterling terms are up 18% since the last meeting. But this is unlikely to outweigh the backdrop of a volatile global climate, slowing domestic activity and the imminent referendum on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU membership. We expect all nine MPC members to vote to keep rates on hold. The US Federal Reserve is also meeting next week and will announce its policy decision at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. Again, no change is expected. Not only has Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder Mike Ashley berated a parliamentary committee for trying to force him to give evidence, accusing MPs of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately antagonistic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he has also sacked Newcastle United coach Steve McClaren (Ashley owns the football club). Oil giant BP has scrapped its long-term sponsorship of Tate Britain, in light of the recent oil price rout. Meanwhile, the Economist has looked at a kitschy animated video about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest five-year economic plan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every five years in China, man; They make a new development plan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd goes the country-style ditty. You can read the piece here. Time for a look at the markets. The FTSE 100 in London is holding on to its gains, trading 1.6% higher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a gain of nearly 100 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 6134.35. All the main European stock markets are recording strong gains. The Dax in Frankfurt and the CAC in Paris are both 2.8% ahead while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bounced 2.9%, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped more than 4%. The continued recovery in oil prices has helped, with Brent crude up 2% to $40.85 a barrel. The International Energy Agency said today that oil prices may have bottomed. Traders also seem to have concluded that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was overdone. It is worth noting that the European Central Bank sought to mitigate the impact of negative interest rates banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets by offering to pay them for lending to companies in the eurozone. Back to the ECB. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good (and fun) explanation of what happened yesterday from Jim Reid, head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank. I suppose if I was trying to explain yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting to a child it might go something like this. Imagine you were expecting a trip during school holidays in a caravan around the country but instead you can take 2 weeks off school, fly first class to Disneyworld, have a go in the cockpit on the way, stay at a hotel made of chocolate, and then be able to go on every ride every day without queuing and have a private play session with the real Mickey Mouse as each day draws to a close. However if the market was the same kid its reaction yesterday was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do I not get unlimited spending money, and where are we going for our summer holidays then?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given that Draghi over-delivered on most measures one can only wonder what the market reaction would have been if he had under delivered and stuck to the caravan trip. In reality he probably didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help matters by suggesting the ECB saw no need to cut rates further early in his press conference... However to give that comment some perspective when does a central banker ever say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure if this will work so we may have to do more further down the road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? So that specific reaction was a little surprising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Royal Statistical Society also welcomed the final report of the independent review led by Bean, and called on the chancellor to implement its recommendations in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget to ensure gaps in the official statistics are plugged. Mike Hughes, chair of the RSS national statistics advisory group, said: The Bean Review is a substantial and important piece of work. It shows how the UK can have the data we need to drive our economy. We now look to the chancellor to allocate the resources in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget to make this happen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sir Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, welcomed Bean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations. The Authority welcomes Sir Charles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations, which set out a compelling vision for economic statistics and alongside the Authority strategy Better Statistics, Better Decisions, will help to deliver high quality economic statistics The Authority will now take time to read and consider the report and its findings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth rate would be higher if its official statistics fully captured all the activity in the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the digital boom, according to former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Take economic statistics back to the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says in his review of government statistics. He recommended that the Office for National Statistics set up a new research centre to come up with better ways of measuring digital activity. Bean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions, published here, build on his interim findings from last year. Current statistics were designed over 50 years ago when the economy was dominated by goods, not services. It argues that the digital revolution has changed the way many businesses operate such as Amazon and Skype; given rise to new ways of exchanging and providing services (Airbnb, TaskRabbit); and has muddied the waters between work and leisure, and made it far harder to accurately measure economic output. Many businesses also operate across national borders and depend on intangible assets, which makes it harder to capture their output. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has said it had reached a preliminary agreement with the London Stock Exchange on a framework for a planned stock trading link. The two exchanges will now conduct more detailed studies into the feasibility of a Shanghai-London scheme. Over in Greece, industrial output rose 4.6% in January from a year earlier, following a 6.2% increase in December, according to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics service ELSTAT. Manufacturers boosted output by 5.% but mining output slumped 13.6%, while electricity production went up 6.8%. Here is some reaction to the UK trade data from Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who says trade is likely to be a drag on overall economic growth again in the first quarter. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures show that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery remains worryingly unbalanced. The volume of goods imports in January was 0.4% above its Q4 average, while the volume of goods exports was 1.1% below it Q4 average. Admittedly, imports have been very volatile from recently, and the 20.8% month-to-month surge in food, beverage and tobacco import volumes in January likely will be reversed in February. But we expect the trade deficit to remain bloated this year. Past experience suggests it will take at least a year for sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent depreciation to boost exports. By contrast, the weaker exchange rate will boost import prices relatively swiftly, thereby worsening the trade deficit in the near-term. With global trade flows weak too and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery likely to remain heavily dependent on consumers, we expect net trade to continue to impede the economic recovery this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top public auditor has branded EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a318bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset as potentially risky. The Cour des Comptes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the French equivalent of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Audit Office \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said EDF, which is 85% state owned, should take a close look at the risks associated with the \u00c2\u00a318bn project to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. The auditor said: Even though the [Hinkley Point] deal has not been finalised, the complexity of the deal and especially the way it could impact the responsibility of EDF suffice to raise serious questions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can read more here. Meanwhile, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry had a bad start to the year. Output unexpectedly dropped by 0.2% in January after rising 2.1% in December, confounding expectations of an increase. However, in the fourth quarter of last year construction output grew by 0.3%, rather than falling 0.4%, according to revised figures from the statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office. The UK trade figures are out. They are a mixed bag: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit shrank to \u00c2\u00a33.5bn in January from a revised \u00c2\u00a33.7bn in December, according to official figures. However, the shortfall with the European Union ballooned to a record high of \u00c2\u00a38.1bn from \u00c2\u00a37.4bn as Britain imported more from Europe. The Office for National Statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 website has all the details. Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder Mike Ashley has accused MPs of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately antagonistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, claiming they are abusing parliamentary procedure by trying to force him to give evidence to a committee, my colleague Sean Farrell writes. In a letter to Iain Wright, chairman of the business, innovation and skills committee, Ashley said he was disgusted by the MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. On Wednesday, the committee warned Ashley publicly that he risked being in contempt of parliament if he failed to appear. Ashley wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was disgusted to learn that you have adopted a stance that is deliberately antagonistic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He accused Wright of trying to create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153media circus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by summoning him. The letter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contents were reported in the Times on Friday and confirmed by Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman. The British Chambers of Commerce has cut its forecasts for UK economic growth, blaming the weaker global economy, and described Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mediocre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd compared to the past. The BCC now expects GDP to rise by 2.2% this year and 2.3% in 2017k similar to growth in 2015 and down from its estimates of 2.5% for 2016 and 2017 in December. Other forecasters have made similar downgrades this year. The business lobby group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting director general Adam Marshall said: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance is reasonably good when measured against our main competitors, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only mediocre when compared against long-term trends.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BCC urged UK chancellor George Osborne to use his budget next Wednesday to boost investment in transport and digital infrastructure. It made no mention of the referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU on 23 June. The organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director general John Longworth quit this week after saying he wanted Britain to leave the EU, which the BCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president said breached its neutral position on the EU. The International Energy Agency has called the bottom of the oil price rout, in a significant shift from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook. There are signs that prices might have bottomed out. For prices there may be light at the end of what has been a long, dark tunnel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Paris-based organisation added in its monthly market report that market forces are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working their magic and higher-cost producers are cutting output.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last month, it was still predicting that crude had further to fall, arguing that the market remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153awash in oil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The agency is now forecasting that oil production outside the Opec cartel will fall by 750,000 barrels a day this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 150,000 barrels a day more than it estimated last month. Output losses in Iraq and Nigeria will also underpin markets, it said, and also noted that Iran is restoring production more slowly than planned after sanctions were lifted. Oil prices are up 50% from the 12-year lows hit in January. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained 1.4% today to $40.62 a barrel. David Kohl, chief currency strategist and head economist Germany at Swiss private banking group Julius Baer, has concluded: The ECB delivered as much as it could do and even managed to surpass expectations. The unconvincing financial market reaction points to a diminishing power of central banks over asset prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FTSE 100 index is now some 90 points ahead at 6127.21, a gain of more than 90 points, underpinned by a recovery in oil prices. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC have jumped more than 2%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Effectively wiping the slate clean after its last minute plunge on Thursday evening the FTSE surged 1.5% this morning, lifted by a recovery from Brent crude that sees the commodity back nearing its recent highs after plunging past the $40 mark following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakdown in talks between OPEC and non-OPEC members. That left the oil and mining stocks in a healthy shade of green, the usual 2016 pre-requisite for the FTSE posting any growth. Still to come are the UK trade deficit figures, expected to widen to \u00c2\u00a310.3 billion from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a39.9 billion, something that could slightly knock the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning confidence as the day goes on. Much like the FTSE the eurozone indices had a disastrous end to Thursday; investors fled the region after Draghi stabbed his own stimulus package in the back by suggesting that there is no more room to cut the benchmark interest rate, leaving many to question what the ECB has left in its arsenal if this round of measure doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Friday morning, however, has seen something of a rebound; the DAX and CAC both rose around 1.8% after the bell, with investors seemingly reassessing their previously schizophrenic reaction to the ECB announcement. Eurozone bond markets have stabilised after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off, triggered by ECB president Mario Draghi saying he did not anticipate further rate cuts, which rapidly dampened enthusiasm for the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big package of stimulus measures. The ECB sprang a surprise on markets by cutting all main interest rates and boosting its quantitative easing programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn a month. It said it would start buying corporate debt and offered to pay banks for lending to companies in the eurozone in an attempt to boost economic growth and ward off deflation. But then Draghi sent markets into a tailspin with the comment that rates may have reached the bottom. Today, two-year German government bond yields are on course for their biggest weekly rise since early December, although ten-year German Bund yields fell. On a light day for corporate news, Old Mutual has said it would split up the company into four main units to save money. Shares in the Anglo-South African financial services group have risen 1.5% on the news. British pubs group JD Wetherspoon has seen first-half pretax profits dip nearly 4% and chairman Tim Martin complained once again that government tax policy was penalising pubs and restaurants, struggling to compete with supermarkets selling cheap booze. Watkin Jones, which builds student accommodation in the UK, is eyeing a London float. It is expected to be valued at \u00c2\u00a3255m when it lists on the Alternative Investment Market later this month. The firm wants to expand into the booming private rented sector. It said it had the capacity to deliver at least 10 student halls each year. It has 31 developments with 11,300 beds in the pipeline at the moment. As we reported recently, investors have been piling into student housing and student rents are rising steadily. A record \u00c2\u00a36bn was invested in purpose-built housing in the UK last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than in north America. Investors are attracted by the high income returns due to strong demand: students numbers are rising every year and there is a shortage of adequate accommodation. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. The FTSE 100 in London has jumped nearly 1.7% to 6136.84 in the first few minutes of trading, a gain of about 100 points, no doubt helped by the rise in oil prices. Brent crude has gained 1.6% to $40.69 a barrel. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any fallers on the UK benchmark index at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only risers. European shares are also up strongly. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 1.9%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is up 1.7% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has leapt 2.1%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a light day for economic news. The highlight will be UK trade and construction data for January at 9.30am GMT. In December, the goods and services trade deficit shrank to \u00c2\u00a32.7bn, from \u00c2\u00a34bn in November. But Investec economist Chris Hare said: Despite the narrowing in the overall deficit last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers do not fill us with optimism, at least for the near term. In part, that is because the turnaround was driven by a 3.6% fall in import values, while exports fell by 0.8%. Within that, services exports fared particularly poorly. Lingering effects of past rises in the pound could be playing a role here, as could the challenging global environment. Recent falls in sterling should help boost net trade going forward, but this might take a few months to come through meaningfully. He is expecting the goods and services shortfall to widen to \u00c2\u00a33.2bn, with the goods deficit rising to \u00c2\u00a310.3bn from \u00c2\u00a39.9bn. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the day after the European Central Bank unveiled an unprecedented package of growth-boosting measures, including rate cuts and a boost to its asset-buying programme. Stock markets initially surged and the euro plunged as ECB president Mario Draghi \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overdelivered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only to go into reverse when he suggested that interest rates may have hit the bottom. Analysts termed it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi shoots down his own bazooka\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Investec) or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bazooka misfires\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (CMC Markets UK). After a rollercoaster ride, European stock markets ended the day lower, with London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index losing 1.8% to 6036.70, its lowest close since late February. The euro dropped by a cent and a half to $1.0825 against the dollar, but then jumped more than 3% from its lows. Wall Street was flat yesterday after a volatile session. In Asia, traders were unsure how to react and stocks initially followed European shares lower but then rose across the board. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei rose 0.5% and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng gained 0.8%. European markets are expected to take their cue from Asia and open higher as traders digest the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures. Stock futures suggest that the FTSE 100 could rise as much as 1.5% at the open, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC are also seen rising by 1% or more. But following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls, European stock markets could well finish the week lower for the first time since mid-February.",

Growth slows (recession possible), unemployment rises, the Bank of England (BoE) loosens monetary policy and fiscal deficits rise.</p> <p>\u00c2\u00b7 <strong>Our key tail risk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a sterling crisis:</strong> A loss of confidence by markets leads to a run on sterling. This remains a low-probability event. But we cannot rule it out given the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious twin deficits. It would probably require the BoE to hike, despite weak demand, in order to support the pound, counter inflation and keep capital in the country.</p> <p>\u00c2\u00b7 <strong>In the long run, we are still alive: </strong>Eventually, growth would return to more-normal patterns. But slower population growth, weaker investment and limits on free trade would likely reduce the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential growth rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the size of this shock would depend on the new trade agreements with the EU and other countries.</p> <p>\u00c2\u00b7 <strong>Boris for Prime Minister: </strong>David Cameron would likely resign as Prime Minister, creating turmoil in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson would likely win a leadership battle against other prominent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Conservative Party. Anti-UK parties in pro-EU Scotland would push for another referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a modest to high chance that a new vote ends in Scotland leaving this time.</p> <p>\u00c2\u00b7 <strong>Norway style? </strong>The UK will likely try to strike a deal for preferential access to the EU market. Of the three most likely options, Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Association (EEA) would be the least bad. But this might not be on offer.

                "bodyText":"Despite weak Chinese data over the weekend and a drop in the oil price, investors pushed stock markets higher ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raft of central bank meetings. The poor Chinese retail sales and industrial production figures only served to suggest there could be further stimulus measures from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to boost its economy. So for the moment we are in bad news is good territory once more. As for the oil price, the slide below $40 a barrel for Brent did not upset the generally positive mood. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today has marked a positively tranquil start for European markets, which have been grinding higher following on from the post-ECB rally seen last week. Tentative signs of weakness in the crude markets have sent jitters across the commodity space, with energy, precious metals and base metals all suffering on the day. This decoupling of commodity prices and equity markets highlights a possible end to the direct linkage between crude and stocks which has dominated the trading landscape over recent months. The upbeat mood follows last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than expected stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, but now all eyes are on the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, all of whom meet this week. So more volatility is likely in the coming days, but for the moment, the final scores for the day showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.78 points or 0.57% at 6174.57 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 1.62% to 9990.26 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.31% higher at 4506.59 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was virtually unchanged, down just 0.03% at 18,981.77 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.57% at 9142.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 566.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 18 points or 0.11% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The negative news for the oil price continues. After Opec said excess supply would be higher than previously thought this year and Iran dashed hopes of a co-ordinated cut in output, came reports that US crude stockpiles continued to rise. Information firm Genscape said inventories at Cushing in Oklahoma, the delivery hub for US crude, rose by 585,854 barrels, according to Reuters. So Brent crude continues to sit in negative territory, down 2.6% to $39.32 a barrel, although off its worst levels of the day of $38.82. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down nearly 4% at $36.97. Oil continues to slide: Anyone waiting for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor announcement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Bangladesh after cyber thieves stole $81m from the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts.....will have to wait a little longer it appears. To recap, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has heavily criticised Bangladesh Bank for not alerting the government to the theft earlier, and said a statement concerning the central bank would be made shortly. However Reuters is reporting that the announcement will now be made on Tuesday rather than today. It says central bank governor Atiur Rahman has been in India for a conference and arrived back late on Monday. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly oil report has kept its overall forecast for growth in crude demand unchanged at 1.25m barrels a day for 2016. But it has cut its estimate for demand for the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own crude, and says its forecast that supply from non-Opec producers will decline by 700,000 is becoming more uncertain. It said rival producers were still trying to maintain output despite low prices. So it expects excess supply in 2016 to increase to 760,000 barrels a day from the previously anticipated 720,000. Some Opec producers have proposed freezing output at January levels, with a meeting between its members and other producers such as Russia reportedly planned for Doha in April. But Iran, which has just returned to the world stage following the lifting of sanctions, is believed to be reluctant to agree to a freeze. Overall Opec said its output fell by 175,000 barrels a day in February to 32.28m barrels compared to January. The Opec report comes after the International Energy Agency said last week it believed oil prices - which have slumped on a glut of supply and falling demand - might have bottomed out. Brent crude is currently down 3% at $39.17. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank announcement included - as well as a further rate cuts - the proposal to buy bonds through its QE programme issued by companies and not just financial institutions. Here is a note of what has been bought so far through the QE programme: Another big share mover today is GW Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical business which develops cannabis-based treatments. Its shares have more than doubled after news that its Epidiolex drug had significantly reduced seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a type of epilesy for which there are currently no treatments approved in the US, compared to a placebo. The full story is here: The Starwood news has also prompted thoughts of further consolidation in the sector, helping push up shares in UK-listed InterContinental Hotels by more than 4% to \u00c2\u00a328.45. Shares in hotel chain Starwood have soared in early New York trading, after a Chinese consortium launched an audacious $13bn takeover bid. Chinese insurance group Anbang is leading the group, which is proposing to pay $76 per share in cash for Starwood, which owns the Sheraton, St Regis and W Hotels chains. That may have come as a nasty shock to Marriott, which reached an agreement to acquire Starwood last November at an estimated $63.74 a share. Starwood has said this new offer is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly conditional and non-binding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But Wall Street reckons it is serious, sending the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares up 6.6% to over $75... The US stock market has just opened for the week, surprising any European who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise America put its clocks forward yesterday (ahem). Shares are dipping in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 26 points or 0.15%. Investors may be cautious ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-day Federal Reserve meeting, which culminates with a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the Fed faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delicate balancing act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this week. They will want to sound cautious about the economic outlook, without causing panic, while also probably predicting three rate rises this year. The fact that markets only discount a 20% chance of a rate hike in April, and a 43% probability of a June move, highlights that this delicate balancing act will be no easy task. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berenberg has become the latest bank to predict turmoil if Britain votes to leave the European Union. In a new report, Berenberg identified the usual risks, including a weak pound, slower growth, and a sharp hit to business confidence. It also floated the prospect of London mayor Boris Johnson ending up in Number 10 Downing Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from Berenberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kallum Pickering: \u00c2\u00b7 In the short-run, a vote for Brexit would be a demand-side shock: A sharp rise in uncertainty would harm business and household confidence, causing investment and spending to decline. Growth slows (recession possible), unemployment rises, the Bank of England (BoE) loosens monetary policy and fiscal deficits rise. \u00c2\u00b7 Our key tail risk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a sterling crisis: A loss of confidence by markets leads to a run on sterling. This remains a low-probability event. But we cannot rule it out given the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious twin deficits. It would probably require the BoE to hike, despite weak demand, in order to support the pound, counter inflation and keep capital in the country. \u00c2\u00b7 In the long run, we are still alive: Eventually, growth would return to more-normal patterns. But slower population growth, weaker investment and limits on free trade would likely reduce the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential growth rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the size of this shock would depend on the new trade agreements with the EU and other countries. \u00c2\u00b7 Boris for Prime Minister: David Cameron would likely resign as Prime Minister, creating turmoil in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson would likely win a leadership battle against other prominent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Conservative Party. Anti-UK parties in pro-EU Scotland would push for another referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a modest to high chance that a new vote ends in Scotland leaving this time. \u00c2\u00b7 Norway style? The UK will likely try to strike a deal for preferential access to the EU market. Of the three most likely options, Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Association (EEA) would be the least bad. But this might not be on offer. And, even if it were, the UK might have to accept serious concessions that are far worse than those which Mr Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd terms avoid. EEA membership would give the UK autonomy over its external trade policy towards non-European Union countries, which it does not have currently as an EU member. But the UK on its own may lack the clout to strike better deals with Asia and the US than the much bigger EU can. Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has soared by 6% following the surprise devaluation of the Egyptian pound this morning. Investors are confident that the move will help Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, by attracting overseas capital back to the country. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also likely to be inflationary, so Egyptian businesses and consumers should expect higher borrowing costs soon. Jason Tuvey, a Middle East economist at Capital Economics, told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inevitably there will be short-term pain as inflation rises, and the central bank will hike rates at its meeting on Thursday, probably in the order of 100 basis points. But in time the devaluation will bring benefits to Egypt...and encourage foreign investors back to the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A former top Irish banker appeared in a Dublin court today, to face charges relating to the collapse of one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen lenders. David Drumm, former CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, was arrested in the early hours of Monday after arriving at Dublin Airport. He had fought attempts to extradite him from the US for several months, before dropping his legal challenge in February. Prosecutors are arguing that Drumm should not get bail, as our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald reports: The 49-year old was formally charged at a north Dublin police station after arriving at Dublin airport from Boston on Monday morning . Drumm is accused of forgery, conspiracy and false accounting for loans in 2008 designed to rescue Anglo Irish Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. The Dublin-born banker denies any wrongdoing. The charges carry prison sentences ranging from a maximum of five years, up to an unlimited term of imprisonment. Anglo Irish played a crucial role in the Irish property boom, which collapsed after the financial crisis. The bank was nationalised in 2009, after sinking under billions of euros of bad property debts. Henry explains: After the rescue of Anglo Irish Bank, it was nationalised and renamed the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic boom, when it became the major financier for overstretched Irish developers and investors playing the global property market, caused national outrage in Ireland. European stock markets are all comfortably higher as City traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds turn to lunch. After a fairly quiet (ok, dull) morning, the FTSE 100 is up 20 points, with mining stocks still among the biggest risers. And the German DAX is still the standout performer, as Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state elections fail to spark a panic in Frankfurt. The prospect of more stimulus measures out of China soon are pushing shares higher, says Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG. Monday is likely to be the calm before the storm as a dearth of corporate and economic data will see traders scratching around for a sense of direction ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK budget and the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Confirmation that China is set to return to its policy of infrastructure spending and equity market support has been as good an excuse as any to see the bulls hold the early morning upper hand. Unsurprisingly, as the Asian beast looks to be awakening from its slumber, the mining sector has been the major beneficiary in the FTSE. Morgan Stanley have also scrapped its prediction that the US central bank would raise interest rates three times in 2016. It now only expects a single hike from the Federal Reserve, in December, reflecting the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker growth prospects. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, they say: In the US, our economists look for the Fed to delay its next rate hike until the December 2016 FOMC meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a big change from their previous expectation of three hikes this year. Our economists expect quarterly real GDP growth to stay below 2.0% through 2017. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out on Wednesday if Fed policymakers have changed their own expectations, when the results of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting are released. Morgan Stanley has slashed their forecasts for global growth, and warned that the risks of a global downturn have increased. In a new report, analyst at the Wall Street bank cautioned that: Growth remains weak and the probability of a global recession has risen..... Our economists are below consensus on global, emerging markets and developed markets growth and have raised their probability of a global recession within the next 12 months to 30%. They cut their prediction for growth across the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 largest countries to just 1.5%, down from 1.8%, and halved its forecast for Japanese growth. MS also forecast much deeper recessions in Brazil and Russia this year, reflecting gloom over emerging market prospects. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timely reminder for global central bank chiefs in the UK, US and Japan as they gather to set monetary policy this week. Indeed, MS warns that central bankers are losing the power to keep economies on track. Central banks hold a declining number of less effective policy tools. Their latest foray, negative rates, may do more harm than good. How bad is it if central banks are powerless to boost the economy? Well, it clearly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good. But it also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (and therefore bad) as often portrayed. Prior to 2010, central bank easing was usually unable to stop market declines (2002, 2008). And this makes sense; policy can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the course of the underlying economy, it can only nudge it one way or the other. Bloomberg agrees that this is a big week for monetary policy, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any interest rate hikes or cuts: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the surprisingly decent eurozone factory data, from Howard Archer. There were widespread gains in output across sectors in January. In particular, capital goods output jumped 3.2% month-on-month while there were also healthy month-on-month gains for consumer non-durables (2.4%), durables goods (1.3%) and intermediate goods (0.9%). Additionally,energy output rebounded 2.4% month-on-month in January after a dip of 3.4% month-on-month in December when the weather was unseasonably mild. Among the major Eurozone countries, industrial production saw large month-on-month increases in January in Germany (2.9%), Italy (1.9%),France (1.4%) and the Netherlands (2.1%). There was also a mightily impressive jump of 12.7% in Ireland. However, Spanish output edged down 0.2% month-on-month in January. Boom! Eurozone factories have reported a surprisingly strong increase in factory output. Industrial production across the single currency region surged by 2.1% month-on-month in January, and was 2.8% higher than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging signal for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lacklustre economy, which appeared to slow at the start of this year. City economists, such as IHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Howard Archer, are impressed: No immediate market reaction, though - with shares still comfortably up this morning. Over in Bangladesh, the government has lashed out at the central bank after cyber thieves pinched $81m from its accounts. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has promised a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor announcement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shortly, and heavily criticised Bangladesh Bank for not alerting the government to the theft earlier. As we covered last week, the funds were lifted from an account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last month. The hackers nearly stole $1bn, but authorities noticed they had misspelled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfandation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and halted the transfer. Muhith is fuming about the affair, telling reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bangladesh Bank has the audacity not to inform me..... I am very unhappy about it. The handling of the matter by Bangladesh Bank is very incompetent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude oil has fallen back below $40 per barrel this morning, after Iran sank hopes of a co-ordinated production cut. Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates, explains (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil is down because Iran said they would only join the output freeze group once they reached production of 4 million barrels a day (bpd).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent had hit a three-month high last week, partly due to speculation that producers might agree to slow their pumps. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall is good news for consumers, but worrying for central bankers as they struggle to get inflation up. Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has just fired another shot in the currency wars, by devaluing its currency. In an unexpected move, the Egyptian Central Bank cut the value of the Egyptian pound by around 13%. That means one US dollar is now worth 8.85 Egyptian pounds, up from 7.73 before. The move follows a worrying drop in Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange reserves. The Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cairo correspondent, Heba Saleh, explains why that matters: Falling foreign currency inflows have been strangling businesses and threatening imports of basic necessities including medicines. A terrorist bomb that downed a Russian airliner caused a sharp drop in tourist numbers exacerbating already dollar shortages. Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank also announced it would follow a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more flexible exchange rate policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - which looks like an admission that it will allow the currency to keep weakening. In Frankfurt, traders have responded to Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drubbing at the polls...by sending shares soaring. The DAX index has jumped over the 10,000 point mark for the first time since mid-January, making it the best-performing stock market today. Every share is up, with semiconductor firm Infineon Technologies and carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler all up 2.5%. You might have expected shares to suffer from the news that the governing CDU party lost two state elections yesterday. But some analysts argue that those defeats don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect too badly on its leader. Our Berlin bureau chief Philip Oltermann explains: During the campaign, CDU candidates in all three states had distanced themselves to varying degrees from their leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for the refugee crisis. The politician who won in Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Green state premier Winfried Kretschmann, had passionately defended the German chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open-borders stance, stating in one day that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153praying every day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for her wellbeing. A breeze of optimism has pushed shares higher in London this morning. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 44 points, or 0.75%, to 6184 points. That adds to the 103-points jump recorded on Friday, as traders (belatedly) welcomed the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stimulus package. Mining stocks are leading the rally, which is usually a sign of optimism about growth prospects and the (slowing) Chinese economy. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says traders are expecting Chinese authorities to deliver more stimulus measures - after last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor industrial production and retail sales figures. At odds with the old adage \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no news is good news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it would appear it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all news is good news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to China. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has also enjoyed a solid day, with the Shanghai Composite index closing 1.7% higher. The rally was sparked by hopes of fresh intervention from Beijing, after a Chinese regulator said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to consider withdrawing government bailout funds from the market. That helped traders to ignore the latest disappointing Chinese economic data, which showed a sharp slowdown in retail sales (to +10.2%, from +11.1%). Industrial production growth also weakened, to 5.4% from 5.9%. Shares have pushed higher across Asia as the rally that began in Europe last Friday continues. In Japan, the Nikkei jumped by 1.75% to close at 17,233, a one-week high. There were similar gains at other bourses, as investors begin the week in good spirits ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of central bank meetings. Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG in Singapore, says traders are hopeful that US interest rates remain unchanged for a few more months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors seemed more confident that there is little chance of a March Fed hike this week, but they are anticipating some sort of guidance at the press conference.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fireworks from the European Central Bank, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other top central banks get their time in the spotlight this week. The Bank of Japan (Tuesday ), the US Federal Reserve (Wednesday) and the Bank of England (Thursday) will all ponder how to set monetary policy to guide their respective counties forward - through the malaise of the global economy. Mario Draghi has set the bar pretty high, by announcing rate cuts and fresh stimulus measures last week. Could the BoJ follow suit? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible, given Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s persistent deflation and low growth problems. Alastair Winter, chief economist at City bank Daniel Stewart, explains: Recent developments have suggested Prime Minister Abe is applying pressure for even more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrowth-friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interventions, especially as Consumer Confidence last week added to the list of dismal data. BoJ Governor Kuroda has become quite skittish of late and his recent remarks that all was going well could presage a further bout of easing, albeit perhaps not this week. A few month ago, investors had expected the Federal Reserve to raise rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now unlikely, given the recent signs of weakness in the global economy. As this chart shows, economists expect the first rate hike in June - but they have been wrong before.... Either way, Fed policymakers will provide new economic forecasts and rate hike predictions, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get an insight into their mood. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect too much from the Bank of England; its likely to leave interest rates at just 0.5%, extending a pattern that began in March 2009. Winter again: Meanwhile, Governor Carney has in the past also been criticised for sending out false signals but he has been more consistent recently and, having resisted negative rates and more QE hitherto, is most unlikely to announce any changes on Thursday. So the long period of record low borrowing costs is likely to continue: Also coming up today... OPEC, the oil cartel, is due to publish its latest monthly report today (probably before lunchtime) In the UK, chancellor George Osborne should be putting the finishing touches to his budget, due on Wednesday. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be a gloomy affair, with Osborne already admitting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make \u00c2\u00a34bn of fresh cuts. And yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German state elections may have some impact on the markets. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU party lost two state seats, with both pro and anti-refugee parties making ground. Not much corporate news or economic data to look forward to, alas, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do our best.....",

Economist Mattias Bru\u00c3\u00a9r said:</p> <blockquote> <p>In all likelihood, the Fed will hold rates steady at the March meeting. The current low probability of a hike \u00e2\u20ac\u201c four percent according to future market pricing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is relevant since the Fed wants to avoid big policy surprises at the current juncture. While the recent easing in financial conditions should have eased the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic growth concerns, policymakers probably want to see real GDP growth picking up before hiking rates.</p> <p>The Fed is most likely to be still looking for policy normalisation. While a number of officials may well vote for only two hikes in 2016, the median of the dot plots [the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indicators of possible rate rises] will likely suggest three hikes in 2016 and four hikes in 2017. Our view is that the Fed likes to see better growth before hiking rates; real GDP growth slowed to just one per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter but seems to have picked up to above two per cent in the first quarter. Recession risks have certainly abated in recent weeks as US data has surprised to the high side and financial conditions have improved substantially, thus reversing the tightening seen in January and February. Moreover, the industrial sector is probably at an inflection point too; the most recent ISM manufacturing survey increased substantially and is expected to move back above the 50 level. However, with respect to the policy meeting currently underway, officials may still want to take more time to assess the spill-over effects from financial conditions tightening earlier this year.</p> <p>The global growth outlook is a cause for concern too and as such we do not expect tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement to reintroduce the balance of risk assessment that was taken out of the January statement. By contrast, if the statement says that the balance of risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnearly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, it would be a strong indication that the Committee is paving the way for an interest rate hike within the next few meetings. While we suspect that the Fed is currently eying the June 2014-2015 policy meeting, this is just a week ahead of the Brexit referendum.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e82e79e4b00ee214c7b2df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-15T15:55:08.737Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two big events coming up on Wednesday, the UK budget and the outcome of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting.</p> <p>It is unlikely the Fed will raise rates this time round, with the latest US data in the form of <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/15/china-tobin-tax-stock-markets-central-bank-business-live?page=with:block-56e803ece4b00eb3a28f7970#block-56e803ece4b00eb3a28f7970\">a fall in retail sales</a></strong>. But that does not mean rate hikes will not happen later in the year. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the Federal Funds futures market there is no likelihood of another rate hike to follow on from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to deliver a hawkish statement and talk up the probability of a rate rise at its June meeting. This may or may not lead to a rally in the US dollar. Given how the yen and euro reacted to recent monetary policy adjustments from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and European Central Bank, nothing can be certain. At the end of January the BOJ took interest rates into negative territory. This was completely unexpected. Yet despite making a move designed to undermine the attraction of the Japanese yen, the BOJ was caught off-guard when the currency rallied sharply following their decision. </p> <p> Last week the ECB took its deposit rate deeper into negative territory... Despite this, together with a trolley-load of stimulus measures, the euro (like the yen) defied expectations and rallied strongly. Investors inferred that the ECB had reached the limits when it came to easing monetary policy. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17b66286b0b54eb61c28d063c2e509fda4c6dc82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b66286b0b54eb61c28d063c2e509fda4c6dc82/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>So now we have the Fed. Back in December the FOMC projected an additional 100 basis-points of hikes for 2016. The dollar rallied as investors repositioned themselves for the widening divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and the rest of the developed world central banks. But the greenback fell sharply in early February as market turbulence, the ongoing sell-off in oil and concerns over high yield bonds led to a big risk-off move. Investors became convinced that the FOMC would have to dial back on its plan for tighter monetary policy, or even reverse its December hike.</p> <p>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a big rally in risk assets since Janet Yellen delivered her testimony in Washington on 11 February. She managed to convince everyone that the US economy was steaming along at a decent clip, but there were sufficient global concerns for the central bank to be restrained when it came to tightening monetary policy. The FOMC will want to keep the upside momentum going, so expect something similar from its statement and summary of economic projections tomorrow.</p> <p>However, it may prove harder to keep things going this time round. The bounce-back in oil and equities looks to be losing momentum. The dollar is the key to where we go next. Conventional wisdom says that the dollar should strengthen as the Fed looks to tighten as other central banks continue with loose monetary policies. But this seems an obvious trade and one which is probably priced in to a large extent. If the dollar were to weaken now then it would take a lot of pressure off oil, other dollar-denominated commodities and emerging markets with dollar-denominated debt. It would also help the sales and earnings of US multinationals. Of course, the markets will do whatever they do. But no one is ready yet for an all-out currency war and January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 meeting could have provided a venue for discussing a coordinated approach to future FX moves. After all, the BOJ Governor appears to have changed his mind on negative interest rates after meeting up with G20 colleagues.

This one has been partly predicated on hopes that China is stabilizing, which helps explain the sharp rise in commodity prices given that China is the biggest commodities consumer.</p> <p> Unfortunately, signs of real improvement in China are scant. While the U.S. appears to be stabilizing, the Chinese economy remains challenged. The latest evidence came in the form of a 25% plunge in Chinese exports. This was the largest single-month drop since 2009. The government is likely to try to stem the decline with some palliative measures, but a large stimulus package remains unlikely. Furthermore, the drop in Chinese exports calls into question not just the state of the Chinese economy, but the global trade picture as well.</p> <p> Against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in the global economy, the recent rally is beginning to look a bit excessive. This is particularly evident in the sharp drop in volatility. The VIX Index, a key measure of equity market volatility, has fallen to about half of its February peak.

It could pose serious problems to Chinese firms, at a time when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coping with a slowing economy and market turbulence.</p> <p><strong>Jones</strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tobin taxes have had a chequered past, with powerful examples of unintended market disruption and genuine concerns about how a Tobin tax can be effectively operated in a global economy. Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiment with a Tobin tax in the 1980s ended disastrously, with significant trading activity moving from Sweden to other markets. More recently, the attempts by the EU to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have floundered, a key problem being the design of an effective system that discourages migration from the market while avoiding extra-territorial taxation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Currency trading in China represents a different, more focused target than other Tobin taxes and it may be that such a tax will have the desired effect of dampening yuan speculation. However, history has shown that the knock-on effects of such a tax can be significant and unexpected, and the legal and administrative framework of such taxes are often complex and burdensome. Ultimately, both outcomes are likely to create a more challenging business environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>Also.... <strong>Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik</strong> questions whether a levy would deter all speculative attacks. </p> <p>He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted this chart, showing that the gap between buying and selling the yuan is already wider than for other currencies. A Tobin tax would make that gap wider still.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TomOrlik/status/709695776721514497\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">China&#39;s central bank mulling a Tobin tax.

                "bodyText":"A continuing fall in the oil price as well as gloomy comments from the Bank of Japan about the economic outlook combined to help sent markets lower. With worries about growth after weak Chinese data over the weekend, mining shares were among the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers. And in the UK a poll giving a lead to the campaign to leave the European Union also helped unsettle investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 34.60 points or 0.56% to 6139.97 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax also dipped 0.56%, to 9933.85 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.75% lower at 4472.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.14% to 18,765.37 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.69% at 8988.3 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the falling trend, adding 2.31% to 579.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged ahead of the US interest rate decision on Wednesday evening, down just 0.61 points. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow with the UK budget and the US rate news. Earlier, the Serious Fraud Office has ended a long-running investigation into rigging of the \u00c2\u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets without any charges being issued against banks or individuals. Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story is here: And in the currency markets: Back with oil, and an interesting chart on US production: On the fall in equities today, Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Markets around the globe lost ground on Tuesday as investors again became consumed by global growth fears. The FTSE was dragged lower by miners as Japan got a week of central bank announcements off to the worst possible start. The Bank of Japan opted to keep monetary stimulus unchanged, instead it said it wanted to study risks to growth for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest economy, refusing to feed to investors insatiable appetitie for monetary stimulus. US retail sales then reignited concerns about economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects, while investors were spooked by a report that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is considering a tax on currency transactions to try to curb speculation in the foreign exchange markets. It all contrived to dent investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite. Crude oil prices are slipping lower for the second day, on fears of a continuing supply glut amid falling demand, as the recent rally runs out of steam The latest economic data from China, the US and elsewhere, as well as a gloomy outlook from the Bank of Japan earlier today, have combined to reinforce the view that the global economy is slowing down. At the same time there is no sign that oil producers have the ability to cut or even freeze production, especially with Iran keep to boost its output now sanctions have been lifted. Even the prospect of a meeting with Opec and Russia to discuss the oversupply situation has done little to support the price. Analyst Phil Flynn at Price Futures Group told Reuters: The rally is now retreating on fears that Opec will continue to flood the market with oil in a world where demand may falter. And investors are also wary ahead of US data due on Wednesday which could show crude inventories at record highs for the fifth week. So Brent crude is down 2.5% at $38.54 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has dropped 2.9% to $36.10. Nordic bank SEB is expecting a summer hike from the Fed. Economist Mattias Bru\u00c3\u00a9r said: In all likelihood, the Fed will hold rates steady at the March meeting. The current low probability of a hike \u00e2\u20ac\u201c four percent according to future market pricing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is relevant since the Fed wants to avoid big policy surprises at the current juncture. While the recent easing in financial conditions should have eased the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic growth concerns, policymakers probably want to see real GDP growth picking up before hiking rates. The Fed is most likely to be still looking for policy normalisation. While a number of officials may well vote for only two hikes in 2016, the median of the dot plots [the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indicators of possible rate rises] will likely suggest three hikes in 2016 and four hikes in 2017. Our view is that the Fed likes to see better growth before hiking rates; real GDP growth slowed to just one per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter but seems to have picked up to above two per cent in the first quarter. Recession risks have certainly abated in recent weeks as US data has surprised to the high side and financial conditions have improved substantially, thus reversing the tightening seen in January and February. Moreover, the industrial sector is probably at an inflection point too; the most recent ISM manufacturing survey increased substantially and is expected to move back above the 50 level. However, with respect to the policy meeting currently underway, officials may still want to take more time to assess the spill-over effects from financial conditions tightening earlier this year. The global growth outlook is a cause for concern too and as such we do not expect tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement to reintroduce the balance of risk assessment that was taken out of the January statement. By contrast, if the statement says that the balance of risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnearly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, it would be a strong indication that the Committee is paving the way for an interest rate hike within the next few meetings. While we suspect that the Fed is currently eying the June 2014-2015 policy meeting, this is just a week ahead of the Brexit referendum. Two big events coming up on Wednesday, the UK budget and the outcome of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting. It is unlikely the Fed will raise rates this time round, with the latest US data in the form of a fall in retail sales. But that does not mean rate hikes will not happen later in the year. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: According to the Federal Funds futures market there is no likelihood of another rate hike to follow on from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to deliver a hawkish statement and talk up the probability of a rate rise at its June meeting. This may or may not lead to a rally in the US dollar. Given how the yen and euro reacted to recent monetary policy adjustments from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and European Central Bank, nothing can be certain. At the end of January the BOJ took interest rates into negative territory. This was completely unexpected. Yet despite making a move designed to undermine the attraction of the Japanese yen, the BOJ was caught off-guard when the currency rallied sharply following their decision. Last week the ECB took its deposit rate deeper into negative territory... Despite this, together with a trolley-load of stimulus measures, the euro (like the yen) defied expectations and rallied strongly. Investors inferred that the ECB had reached the limits when it came to easing monetary policy. So now we have the Fed. Back in December the FOMC projected an additional 100 basis-points of hikes for 2016. The dollar rallied as investors repositioned themselves for the widening divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and the rest of the developed world central banks. But the greenback fell sharply in early February as market turbulence, the ongoing sell-off in oil and concerns over high yield bonds led to a big risk-off move. Investors became convinced that the FOMC would have to dial back on its plan for tighter monetary policy, or even reverse its December hike. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a big rally in risk assets since Janet Yellen delivered her testimony in Washington on 11 February. She managed to convince everyone that the US economy was steaming along at a decent clip, but there were sufficient global concerns for the central bank to be restrained when it came to tightening monetary policy. The FOMC will want to keep the upside momentum going, so expect something similar from its statement and summary of economic projections tomorrow. However, it may prove harder to keep things going this time round. The bounce-back in oil and equities looks to be losing momentum. The dollar is the key to where we go next. Conventional wisdom says that the dollar should strengthen as the Fed looks to tighten as other central banks continue with loose monetary policies. But this seems an obvious trade and one which is probably priced in to a large extent. If the dollar were to weaken now then it would take a lot of pressure off oil, other dollar-denominated commodities and emerging markets with dollar-denominated debt. It would also help the sales and earnings of US multinationals. Of course, the markets will do whatever they do. But no one is ready yet for an all-out currency war and January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 meeting could have provided a venue for discussing a coordinated approach to future FX moves. After all, the BOJ Governor appears to have changed his mind on negative interest rates after meeting up with G20 colleagues. Who knows what else was discussed? The slump in Valeant Pharmaceuticals is continuing, as investors react to the news that failing to file its annual report could trigger a default. Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is being pummelled today by the latest twists in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corruption scandal. Former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was dramatically arrested two weeks ago, has reportedly accepted a position as a government minister. Pleasingly for Lula, that will give him some immunity against prosecution. Last week, prosecutors accused him of money laundering and tax misrepresentation, but a judge has not yet accepted the charges. Lula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock detainment in early March sent Brazilian assets soaring, as investors anticipated political change and a more market-friendly government potentially taking control. Live is never that simple in emerging markets, of course. The clouds of worry swirling over US drugs firm Valeant Pharmaceuticals have darkened today. Shares in Valeant have plunged by a third in early trading, after the company slashed its revenue forecast by 16% before the market opened. It has also warned that it could default on its debts if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t file its annual report soon (it is already delayed). Valeant has already promised to restate some historical financial results, following claims that it has over-inflated its sales figures. Chief executive officer Mike Pearson has just held a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conference call, in which he admitted that the company is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not operating on all cylinders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This drove shares down to a new three and a half-year low. Pearson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for Valeant was to focus on drug distribution, rather than the costly business of research and development. But a series of critics have blasted the company for hiking prices. accusing it of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgouging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profits out of vulnerable patients Its links with mail-order pharma firm Philidor are also under scrutiny, amid allegations that some Valeant staff worked for Philidor using false names. Fortune Magazine has a good timeline of how things unravelled at Valeant in recent months. Jitters over the oil price and persistent growth worries are hitting stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Shares are falling on Wall Street at the start of trading, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down by 98 points or 0.6%. New York traders are disappointed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that retail sales fell in January and February. The weakening oil price is another concern, with Iran determined to boost its production levels despite oversupply fears. European markets are also in the red. In London the FTSE 100 is down 43 points, or 0.7%. Mining companies continue to be worst hit, after copper producer Antofagasta posted a 34% plunge in profits and scrapped its dividend this morning. And there are heavier losses across Europe, with the French CAC and Italian FTSE MIB both down over 1%. Investors are in gloomier mood after the Bank of Japan downgraded its view of the economy overnight (as covered in the opening post). Some investors are also warning that the recent recovery in share prices simply went too far. Russ Koesterich, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global chief investment strategist, predicts trouble ahead. The equity rebound of the past month is a classic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relief rally,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where investors are relieved conditions are not as bad as they previously feared. This one has been partly predicated on hopes that China is stabilizing, which helps explain the sharp rise in commodity prices given that China is the biggest commodities consumer. Unfortunately, signs of real improvement in China are scant. While the U.S. appears to be stabilizing, the Chinese economy remains challenged. The latest evidence came in the form of a 25% plunge in Chinese exports. This was the largest single-month drop since 2009. The government is likely to try to stem the decline with some palliative measures, but a large stimulus package remains unlikely. Furthermore, the drop in Chinese exports calls into question not just the state of the Chinese economy, but the global trade picture as well. Against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in the global economy, the recent rally is beginning to look a bit excessive. This is particularly evident in the sharp drop in volatility. The VIX Index, a key measure of equity market volatility, has fallen to about half of its February peak. Meanwhile, the VVIX, which measures the volatility of volatility (or, more precisely, how frequently volatility spikes occur), is back to its lowest level since last August. Given the still uneven pace of global growth and tighter financial market conditions, this may too be low. This, in turn, suggests the potential for a rise in volatility \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which would imply another bout of stocks selling off. March may have come in like a lamb, but the lion may be lurking. Back to the main story of the morning, reports that China is considering imposing a financial transaction tax on foreign exchange trading. As explained earlier, the move could potentially deter speculators from targeting the yuan. But Ben Jones, partner and tax expert at law firm Eversheds, has warned that such a levy could backfire on Beijing. It could pose serious problems to Chinese firms, at a time when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coping with a slowing economy and market turbulence. Jones writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tobin taxes have had a chequered past, with powerful examples of unintended market disruption and genuine concerns about how a Tobin tax can be effectively operated in a global economy. Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiment with a Tobin tax in the 1980s ended disastrously, with significant trading activity moving from Sweden to other markets. More recently, the attempts by the EU to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have floundered, a key problem being the design of an effective system that discourages migration from the market while avoiding extra-territorial taxation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Currency trading in China represents a different, more focused target than other Tobin taxes and it may be that such a tax will have the desired effect of dampening yuan speculation. However, history has shown that the knock-on effects of such a tax can be significant and unexpected, and the legal and administrative framework of such taxes are often complex and burdensome. Ultimately, both outcomes are likely to create a more challenging business environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also.... Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik questions whether a levy would deter all speculative attacks. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted this chart, showing that the gap between buying and selling the yuan is already wider than for other currencies. A Tobin tax would make that gap wider still. As chairman of relegation-threatened football team Newcastle United, Mike Ashley is no stranger to difficult away fixtures. But the Sports Direct owner now faces another clash - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be summoned before MPs on the Business committee to answer concerns over how workers are treated. The committee want to quiz Ashley about the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent revelations that staff at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse are searched after each shift - eating into their own time. They will also quiz him about the use of zero-hours contracts, and claims of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgulag\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working conditions. Ashley has proved a tricky man to pin down, but the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patience has now run out - they want to see him on June 7th. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has a good story - one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest private equity firms is plotting a \u00c2\u00a31bn takeover for the Land Registry. The Land Registry holds the official details of who owns Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property and real estate. Chancellor George Osborne is pushing to privatise it, to help tackle the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. And Advent International is waiting in the wings, it seems. However, a sale could provoke union anger, as Kleinman explains: The move could attract renewed opposition from trade unions which have warned previously that a sale of the Land Registry could undermine homebuyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in its data. Advent, whose investment portfolio includes stakes in companies such as DFS, the furniture retailer, and the FTSE-100 payments group Worldpay, is among a substantial number of private equity groups casting their eye over the Land Registry. Consumer spending across the US dipped last month, suggesting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is a little fragile. Retail spending dropped by 0.1% in February, the Commerce Department says. And January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data has been revised down to show a 0.4% fall, not the 0.2% rise that was initially recorded. It could mean that the financial turmoil that hit world markets at the start of 2016 may have hit the real economy. And that would mean even less chance of a US interest rate rise being announced tomorrow, or possibly for several months. Back in the markets, oil is seeping deeper below the $40 per barrel mark. Brent crude has shed 2% so far today, to around $38.65 per barrel - its lowest since March 4th, on renewed oversupply fears. Traders are calculating that the recent rally went too far, as predictions that oil producers would agree cutbacks haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come true. Instead, Iran is insisting it will raise its output to 4 million barrels per day. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intransigence could push the oil price lower, as FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga explains: This commodity is heavily bearish and the pain over the unrelenting oversupply in the oil markets has periodically diminished investor attraction while fears over a potential decline in demand continue to sabotage any solid recovery in price. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executives could be tucking into some Taste The Difference champagne, after announcing their first rise in profits in two years. The results strengthen CEO Mike Coupe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, as he ponders whether to launch a higher takeover bid for Home Retail, owner of the Argos chain. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gloomy picture at French Connection. Shares have fallen 4%, after it posted another full-year loss following weak demand for its spring and summer clothes last year. That means no dividend for the long-suffering FCUK shareholders. Online supermarket Ocado beat expectations, with a 15.3% jump in sales. But analysts are disappointed that the company still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t landed major partnerships abroad, leaving it struggling to turn a decent profit in the UK. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the UK web grocery market, through a tie-up with Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, is a looming threat too. Steve Clayton, Head of Equity Research, Hargreaves Lansdown, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound very impressed with Ocado: The market wants to see deals. Big deals, with upfront licence fees and lovely, lovely royalties ever after. But so far, Ocado has not been able to get anyone to sign on the dotted. CEO Tim Steiner thinks they will, but, we feel compelled to point out, to go ahead and start a venture such as Ocado in the first place, one has to be a bit of an optimist. Ocado is a technological triumph, hamstrung by the difficulties of persuading customers to pay the full cost of delivering the goods. In theory, shorn of the costs of a store estate, highly efficient customer fulfillment centres (CFCs), churning out hundreds and thousands of orders each and every day, largely without human intervention, ought to make good margins. But the cost of getting the goods to the doorstep always seems to outweigh the starting advantage. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running jobs crisis has eased a little. Employment across the eurozone rose by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015, new Eurostat figures show, and was 0.1% higher across the wider European Union. That means there are now 151.9 million people employed in the eurozone, but 10.3% of adults are out of work./ Eurostat reports that employment rose in most countries in the last three months of 2015, but not in the UK. They say: Among Member States for which data are available, Malta (+1.7%) and Croatia (+0.8%) recorded the highest increases in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the previous quarter, followed by Spain, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal and Sweden (all +0.7%). Estonia (-2.4%), the United Kingdom (-1.0%) and Lithuania (-0.3%) recorded decreases. A new opinion poll showing that Britain is more likely to vote to leave the European Union has hit the pound. Sterling has shed around 1% this morning, from $1.43 to $1.416 against the US dollar, after the Daily Telegraph reported a narrow lead for the Brexit campaign. Their latest opinion poll showed Leave on 49% of the vote, with Remain holding 47%. But once people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likelyhood to vote is included, Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead swells to 52% vs 45%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story. The pound first tumbled three weeks ago, when London Mayor Boris Johnson backed the Leave campaigh, but then recovered most of its losses (until today). Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leggings, coffee pods, microwave rice and computer game downloads have all been added to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbasket of goods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 used to measure UK inflation, while CD Roms and nightclub fees are out. This is the Office for National Statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual attempt to better reflect the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending habits. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes show the popularity of Nespresso-style drinks machines, and rising demand for rice packs which can be quickly blasted in the microwave. Readers who enjoy a cheeky shot of Bailey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will be better represented, as cream liquors are now in the basket. And women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leggings, which the ONS magisterially calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a type of casual clothing not currently covered but widely purchased\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd also get in. The ONS has also reacted to the latest changes in technology by adding computer game downloads, and ditching rewritable media (as people increasingly use personal video recorders and download services instead). But the days of shivering in the cold to get into a nightclub are waning, apparently. The ONS has decided to stop counting entry fees, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collection difficulties and reduced expenditure as the number of nightclubs is declining.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full list of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out. European stock markets are fallen by around 0.6% in early trading, after Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank struck a gloomier tone after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 41 points or 0.7% to 6133. Mining shares are doing the damage, with Antofagasta plunging by 9% after it slashed its dividend. It also reported that profits had tumbled by 34% last year, due to the commodity rout. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reports that investors are more worried about the mining sector and oil prices. The up-trend that had become established off those mid-February lows is looking set to fail and this is knocking confidence in the natural resources sector in general, although the miners are finding themselves under added pressure this morning as Antofagasta becomes the latest in the sector to axe dividend payments. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in Bangladesh this morning too, where the central bank governor has resigned following one of the biggest cyber thefts ever. Atiur Rahman fell on his sword today, six weeks after online thieves made off with $101m from the central bank. Back in February, they backed into its computer systems of BangladeshBank and transferred the money from its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to casinos in the Philippines. $20m has been recovered, but investigators are still struggling to locate the missing $81m Rahman told Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bureau in Dhaka that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I resigned and the prime minister accepted it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, Bangladesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry said it was furious that it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been immediately informed about the breach and blasted the central bank for being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very incompetent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Amazingly, the thieves could have escaped with $1bn, but they blundered by mis-spelling \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on a web form - triggering a security alert. Rahman, who left school because of financial hardship, is known for fighting poverty in Bangladesh and has won several awards for his work. Experienced City analyst George Magnus believes China would lose any hopes of challenging the supremacy of the US dollar if it imposed a levy on financial transactions. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, believes Beijing could be preparing to weaken the yuan again. American macroeconomist James Tobin first pitched the idea of a transaction tax in the 1970s. He suggested a small levy on every financial transaction to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthrow sand in the wheels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of reckless speculation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a popular idea in among critics of the current financial system, who believe it could raise funds to pay for the financial crisis and avoid a repeat. However, a Tobin tax on currency trading would undermine China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to get the yuan fully accepted in the financial system. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael McDonough explains: China is reportedly planning a new transaction tax on currency trades, in a new attempt to tighten control of its financial system. According to Bloomberg, a levy could be imposed on foreign exchange transactions. It would be pitched as a way of curbing reckless currency speculation. However, it could also effectively act as a capital control, as it would make it more expensive to shift yuan deposits into other currencies. Bloomberg explains that the new tax would be imposed carefully: The initial rate of the so-called Tobin tax may be kept at zero to allow authorities time to refine the rules, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The tax is not designed to disrupt hedging and other foreign-exchange transactions undertaken by companies, they said. Imposing a levy on foreign-exchange trading would be the most extreme step yet by policy makers to prevent speculative bets against the Chinese currency, after state-run banks repeatedly intervened to support the yuan and the government intensified a crackdown on capital outflows. A Tobin tax would complicate plans by China to create an international reserve currency and could undermine the leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to increase the role of market forces in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: China Drafts Rules for Tobin Tax on Currency Transactions I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers are in the limelight again today. Overnight, the Bank of Japan has left monetary policy unchanged while it watches the impact of its recent move into negative interest rates. Any hopes (or fears) of fresh fireworks were dashed when the BoJ simply maintained its commitment to raise the monetary base by 80 trillion yen per year, and continued to charge commercial banks 0.1% for reserves left in its vaults. The BoJ also sounded gloomier about economic prospects, which might weigh on markets this morning. Chris Weston of IG explain why: The focus of the session was the Bank of Japan, who ultimately delivered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. very little. It certainly seems that the BoJ have little desire to lower the deposit rate deeper into negative territory. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno change\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sets the tone for the US Federal Reserve, which begins its own two-day meeting. Inflation, or the lack of it, is dogging policymakers around the globe. And Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office is going to make the whole thing more interesting by shaking up the contents of the basket used to measure price changes. Usually it ditches a few dusty old relics that no-one buys any more, and chucks in a few trendy new items (last year it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153craft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beers). And on the corporate front, supermarket group J Sainsbury has just announced its first quarterly sales growth in two years (more on that later). The City are also getting results from online supermarket Ocado, engineering firm Balfour Beatty and retailer French Connection. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"After a volatile day, the London stock market has closed higher tonight thanks to a surge in natural resource companies. Silver produced Fresnillo, mining giant Antofagasta and commodity trading group Glencore all surged almost 10% today. They were following a pick-up in the prices of metals, thanks to the weaker dollar which remains on track for its worst day against the British pound since 2009. So the FTSE finished 25 points higher, at 6,201 points. Chris Beauchamp of IG says miners saved the day: Were it not for the mining sector, the FTSE 100 would be firmly in the red, but with commodity prices looking perkier thanks to a weaker dollar, the index has been able to hold close to its recent peak around 6200. European markets have finisher in the red, with the French CAC losing 0.5% and German DAX down almost 1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to alarm over the strength of the euro against the US dollar tonight. The oil price is also pushing higher, with US crude hitting a three-month high tonight. Traders will have plenty to chew on as they travel home, particularly about central banker. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed announcements set the scene for a day in which two central banks cut interest rates (Norway and Indonesia), while two more held rates steady but issued gloomy statements (Switzerland and the UK). Can central banks really keep bailing us out? Or as Justin Trudeau point out, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it really time for fiscal policy to do more?..... On that note, thanks for reading and goodnight. Amid choppy trading in New York, the Dow Jones index has quietly hit its highest level of the year. The Dow is currently up 93 points, or 0.5%, at 17,418, as traders ponder the implications of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new gloomy view of the global economy and the financial markets. The pound is on track for its biggest one-day jump against the US dollar since October 2009, according to Reuters data. Sterling is currently up 1.7%, or 2.4 cents, at $1.4494 , thanks to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden dovishness last night. Ever felt like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re languishing in the wrong job, toiling away at the coalface as your glittering talents go to waste? Me neither. But according to the UK stats office, one in three workers are either over or under-qualified for their roles. As Katie Allen explains, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great sign: In another blow to hopes that the UK can lift its productivity growth out of the doldrums, data from the Office for National Statistics shows the proportion of workers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153matched\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to their job has dropped in recent years. At 68.7% in the three months to December 2015, the percentage of those in employment with a level of education close to the average of their job was down compared with 69.9% two years earlier. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Justin Trudeau, has flashed his Keynesian credentials today. Speaking to Bloomberg, the newly-ish elected leader said that Canada can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply rely on central bankers for growth. Fiscal measures must do their bit too, Trudeau insisted, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should be using fiscal levers a little more and not just expecting monetary policy to have to fix the challenge we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re approaching the limit of the impact of monetary policy alone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is due to present a budget next week, and analysts expect they will lay out plans for a larger deficit. During the interview, Trudeau also diplomatically suggested he could work with Republican front-runner (and global threat-in-waiting) Donald Trump. The fall in the dollar is helping to push the oil and gold prices higher. Brent crude has gained 1.6% so far today, to $41 per barrel. As usual, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatter about a possible agreement to freeze output; producers are due to meet in April. Gold is also enjoying a little romp, up 0.3% to $1,266 per ounce, having surged by 3% yesterday when the Fed decision was announced. The Economist Intelligence Unit is sticking to its forecast that UK interest rates will remain at record lows for another four years. Art Cashin, a legendary figure on Wall Street, reckons the Federal Reserve is still too hawkish about monetary policy when it predicts two rate rises this year. Cashin, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of floor operations at the New York stock exchange, told CNBC that Janet Yellen will be lucky to manage one hike before Christmas. (That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a St Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day hat) The US dollar continues to be thumped today, and has shed more than 1% against other currencies. The greenback continues to suffer from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, when the Fed said it will probably only raise interest rates twice this year, not four times. It has tumbled by almost two cents against the British pound, sending sterling up to $1.4452. And the euro is almost one cent higher, at $1.1316. Christopher Vecchio, Currency Analyst at DailyFX, says traders are racing to get out of the US dollar. The US Dollar may still be the greenback, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green in the face now that the Fed has all but stamped out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153divergence trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carried the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reserve currency for the past two years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, no matter where you turn, US Dollar charts are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpuking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - most everyone was on one side of the trade, and now everyone is rushing for the exits at the same time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPuking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in City jargon, occurs when an asset plunges rapidly, as seen in this chart of the dollar against other currencies today South Africa has bucked the trend and raised interest rates, by a quarter-point to 7%. Worries about the global economy are likely to weigh the New York stock market when trading begins, in 30 minutes time. Reuters explains: Wall Street was set for a lower open onThursday, a day after the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lowered expectations of two interest rate hikes in 2016 pushed the S&amp;P 500 to its highest close this year. The Fed, which left rates unchanged, pointed to moderateU.S. economic growth and strong job gains but cautioned about risks from an uncertain global economy. While markets across assets cheered the move, the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish tone raised some concern about the prospects of the weakness in the global economy impacting the U.S. economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this little bit of rethinking and so, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at a softer opening as some questions arise to the prospects of future growth impacting earnings,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest opening calls: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, believes UK interest rates will remain at record lows for at least another year. He cites weak demand in the eurozone, and weakness in the UK economy too: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prospect of a hike in the Bank Rate remains one for the dim and distant future. The euro-zone - the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single largest source of imports - fell into deflation in February. Moreover, a backdrop of further falls in factory gate prices, subdued wage growth, and February seeing cuts in gas bills, also points to UK inflation rising very modestly this year. In addition, the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget plans imply a slightly more severe fiscal squeeze over the next five years than previously planned, which should further caution the MPC against a tighter policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England announcement: Back to the Bank of England..... and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes show that the MPC is concerned about the global economy. They say: Over the medium term, growth in the advanced economies should continue to be supported by the boost to real incomes from low commodity prices, and to some degree by fiscal and monetary policy. But emerging market economies are likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and the risks to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central projection of only modest global growth lie to the downside. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the financial markets -- the Bank of Japan appears to have intervened to weaken the yen. The BoJ would have been unhappy to see the yen appreciate sharply against the US dollar today, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve was so dovish last night. Financial traders are continuing to protect themselves against sterling plunging around June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, the Bank of England says. Options prices continued to indicate that the price of protection against the risk of a sterling depreciation against the dollar compared with the price of protection against an appreciation was higher than in the second half of 2015. That negative skew had increased over the period since the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous meeting. However, there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little evidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that other UK asset prices have been hurt by Brexit fears, the minutes say. The Bank of England has warned that rising Brexit uncertainty could hit economic demand in the UK. In the minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting, it says that the issue has already weakened the pound. There appears to be increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union. That uncertainty is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling [which has fallen by 9% since last November]. It may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth of aggregate demand in the near term. On the upside, though, the Bank believes that the underlying growth of private domestic demand remains solid. A tighter labour market and rising productivity are expected to support real incomes and consumption. Consumer confidence and most surveys of business investment are above historical averages. Breaking! Britain has entered its eighth year of record low interest rates. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee has voted unanimously to leave borrowing costs at their current record low of 0.5%, extending a run dating back to March 2009. The MPC also voted 9-0 to leave the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00c2\u00a3375bn. Details and reaction to follow.... With Donald Trump tightening his grip on the Republican nomination, the Economist Intelligence Unit has warned that President Trump would be a serious threat to the global economy. As serious, indeed, as a resurgence of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy. In a new report, the EIU argues that if Trump wins November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, he would trigger a trade war and incite fresh turmoil in the Middle East Brexit, Grexit, a Chinese hard-landing and fresh conflict between Russia and Eastern Europe are also significant threats, they say: New data has confirmed that the eurozone has fallen back into negative inflation. Eurostat reports that prices dropped by 0.2% across the single currency bloc in February, in line with its earlier flash estimate, and justifying the stimulus measures announced by the European Central Bank last week And there are now 11 eurozone countries in deflation, up from six in January, as cheap oil pulls down energy costs. Howard Archer IHS Global Insight says: Renewed members of the deflation club in February included Germany, France and Italy. Furthermore, Spanish deflation widened markedly to 1.0% from 0.4% in January.... He believes price pressures will remain weak for some months. The Eurozone may well edge in and out of deflation in the near term, before consumer prices gradually edge up due to reduced year-on-year drops in energy prices helped by base effects, the weak euro and ongoing Eurozone growth. Please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get excited if you receive a message from the Bank of England governor, offering you millions of dollars. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fraud, despite the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcID Card\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offered as proof that it really, really is Mark Carney (it really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) The Bank of England are on the case: Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says City traders are nervous ahead of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big announcement in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. While rates will surely remain at 0.5%, the minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could add to the pessimistic mood, he says. With the BoE due to release its latest monetary policy outlook, fundamental risk remains at the forefront of trader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minds, despite little likeliness of any policy shift. Given yet another OBR growth downgrade yesterday, the chances of a rate hike are slim to none, as reflected by the fact that the rates market currently sees a cut as more likely than the much vaunted hike. Indonesia just followed Norway by cutting interest rates. In its case, from 7% to 6.75%. The early optimism in the stock markets is fizzling out, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s double-dose of central bank gloom. The major European indices are all now in the red, after the pessimistic statements from the Swiss and Norwegian central banks earlier today. They have reignited concerns over weak global growth, and worries that central bankers may be ill-equipped to handle it. Shares in French and German exporters are being hit, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in the value of the euro against the US dollar (making their goods less competitive). Erica Blomgre of Nordic corporate bank SEB says the Norwegian central bank was more pessimistic than expected today, as it lowered interest rates and predicted further cuts ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new rate path is more dovish than what market was pricing ahead of the meeting.... The main reason for the lower path is weaker private and foreign demand, lower rates abroad and lower wages and prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has just cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.5%, and issued its own warning about the economic outlook. Governor \u00c3\u02dcystein Olsen says: Growth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened somewhat and inflation is expected to moderate further out. The Board has therefore decided to lower the key policy rate. And with wage growth weak, and unemployment expected to rise, Olsen says that rates could be cut again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the course of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Nordes Bank even hints that it could even cut interest rates below zero! Should the Norwegian economy be exposed to new major shocks, the Executive Board will not exclude the possibility that the key policy rate may turn negative. More central bank action, this time in Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank has just left interest rates unchanged at minus 0.75%, and warned that the country faces deeper negative inflation too. The SNB also struck a downbeat tone, saying: The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly in recent months and the situation on international financial markets remains volatile. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden dovishness could yet backfire if they are caught out by US inflation pressures, says Jan Von Gerich of Nordea Markets. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets reckon that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates at all this year. They suspect that the looming US election could help keep borrowing costs on hold through 2016 (even though policymakers expect two rate hikes). The Fed chair cited global risks to the US economy and inflation uncertainty, rather than the US economy itself which is performing well, as reasons for a) standing pat in March and b) just maybe standing pat for the rest of the year. We still think (b) is the most likely outcome given what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the menu in the US in the latter half of 2016 (i.e. a presidential election the build-up to which is proving even more of a circus than usual), not to mention that the FOMC needs to keep market sentiment in check. The dollar is continuing to weaken this morning, driving the euro up to a five-week high of $1.1279. The pound has also risen against the US dollar, to $1.429. Brexit fears are taking a back seat today. And India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee has also strengthened: Mining companies are leading the rally in London this morning, with Anglo American surging by almost 10%. They are benefitting from the slump in the US dollar, after the Fed said it only expects two interest rate hikes this year, not four. A weaker US currency pushes up the cost of commodities (as they are priced in dollars), and should also prevent capital from pouring out of emerging markets into US assets. Shares are rallying in Europe, and across Asia, after the US Federal Reserve was surprisingly dovish at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank tore up its previous forecasts for four interest rate rises this year, and now expects to only hike American borrowing costs twice in 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recognition that inflationary pressures are rather weaker than policymakers previously realised. The Fed struck a somewhat downbeat tone, given it had hiked borrowing costs back in December, cautioning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And chair Janet Yellen was at pains to insists that monetary wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on a pre-set course, and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was needed. This dovish approach to rate hikes was cheered on Wall Street, and Asian markets followed suit. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index has closed 1.2% higher, and Australia gained almost 1%. And in London, the FTSE 100 has gained 33 points in early trading to 6210 points. Investors are calculating that the era of ultra-easy monetary policy could be with us for longer than expected, with Japan and the eurozone now operating negative interest rates and British borrowing costs likely to stay low for many years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era of record low interest rates will continue into its eighth year today, as the Bank of England meets to set monetary policy. In a busy period for central bankers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn to consider how to tackle the weak growth and low inflation that is bedevilling the global economy. At noon today the monetary policy committee will announce their decisions, and almost certainly leave interest rates at 0.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be more interesting, showing how worried policymakers are the global economy, the recent turbulence in the financial markets, and even the upcoming EU referendum. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always the possibility that one, or more, of the nine MPC members will vote to change monetary policy today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely, though, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Market explains: Expectations are for another 0-0-9 vote to keep interest rates unchanged. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to imagine accompanying BOE meeting minutes turning more hawkish before the June Brexit vote given Governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings about the risks of uncertainty. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Berkeley said that higher stamp duty has hit the luxury London housing market, sending its shares and other housebuilding stocks lower. The upmarket housebuilder, which focuses on London and the south-east, said reservations for new homes were 4% lower between November and February, compared with the same period a year earlier. It sold 62 homes worth more than \u00c2\u00a32m each, a similar number to a year earlier, when the market slowed in the run-up to the general election. Berkeley warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing supply could be hit by what it called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest property taxation regimes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd along with planning issues, pointing to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sometimes conflicting policies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transaction levels at the upper end of the housing market have been affected by the significant increase in transaction taxes over the past 18 months, which will have consequential effects on both social mobility and the supply of new homes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Purchases of homes costing more than \u00c2\u00a3937,500m became more expensive after an overhaul of the stamp duty regime in December 2014. For example, the effective tax rate on a \u00c2\u00a32.1m property went up to 7.9%, an increase of \u00c2\u00a318,750. And from April, buyers of second homes and buy-to-let properties face a further 3% stamp duty surcharge. The news sent Berkeley shares down over 2% to \u00c2\u00a331.85. Others have warned about a bubble at the top end of the London property market that is about to burst. Investment bank Morgan Stanley and investment firm LCP are predicting that prices for luxury flats will fall amid a glut of new-built properties. However, Berkeley remains confident of achieving \u00c2\u00a32bn of pre-tax profits for the three years to 2017-18, and expects profits this year to be at the top end of forecasts. Analysts have pencilled in \u00c2\u00a3509m, down from \u00c2\u00a3540m last year. The group stressed that despite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global macro uncertainty, including the impending UK European Referendum, underlying demand has remained strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This week it reported progress on plans to build 1,100 homes for private rental as part of a 3,500 home development in partnership with the Greater London Authority in Newham in east London, Berkeley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest rental scheme to date. Shore Capital analyst Robin Hardy said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is clear that Berkeley is repositioning for a very different business profile, buying sites for flats in outer London boroughs and increasingly it would appear more sites for mainstream family housing with sites such as Ascot or Winchester. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would still expect the group to have a bias towards the more expensive end of the market, and these locations support that, and good margins can be made but the super-normal margins that London has produced and the very rapid pace of sales is likely to be very hard to repeat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another sign that luxury housing schemes are struggling to attract buyers, more than 80 apartments on sale at Battersea Power Station in south-west London have had their asking prices slashed since the start of the year, according to the property firm Propcision. Investors are particularly concerned about the Nine Elms and Battersea area, which is receiving a \u00c2\u00a315bn revamp, with new towers being built that critics have derided as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hong Kongification\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of London. But analysts at Jefferies said those selling Berkeley shares were picking the wrong stock: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main argument of those shorting Berkeley shares is that there is an oversupply of high-value homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those with a selling price greater than \u00c2\u00a32m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the Nine Elms and Battersea area \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Our position is that Berkeley is not overly exposed to that particular local market.

But, apart from the UK market, they still managed to end the day in positive terrirtory after a strong start on Wall Street. The recent rally follows the revival in the oil price on hopes that major producers will agree an output freeze, and the dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve about the prospect of further interest rate rises, which has in turn weakened the dollar. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE-100 may have come within 5 points of those highs for the year, but the upward momentum failed to last as a lack of good news continues to plague the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least in London.

But this speculation makes no sense on close inspection.</p> <p>The speculative story runs something as follows. Central bankers in the advanced economies are worried about the market volatility that might be caused by further strength in the US dollar. Specific concerns presumably include the impact on US corporate earnings, additional weakness in commodity prices, financial strains in emerging markets with large external debts, and a greater risk that the [Chinese central bank] would undertake a major devaluation of the renminbi. In this narrative, central bankers have agreed to coordinate monetary policies to cap the dollar against other major currencies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ad0cb5fbe165782bbf1743ffdd769432fcf833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ad0cb5fbe165782bbf1743ffdd769432fcf833/0_0_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Consistent with this, the communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 said a little more than usual on currencies, adding a new commitment to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consult closely on exchange markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the dollar has indeed weakened against both the euro and the yen since the meeting concluded in late- February. In turn, this has allowed the renminbi to fall slightly further on a trade-weighted basis, despite a small appreciation against the US currency.</p> <p>However, we doubt that Shanghai marked a lasting turning point. For a start, the new language in the communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 went only very slightly further than previous warnings about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and commitments to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrain from competitive devaluations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moreover, the dollar had peaked against both the euro and (particularly) the yen some months earlier. Above all, since the G20 the ECB has unveiled a package of bold stimulus measures that might have been expected to weaken the euro.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c254b49a1f748dfc488d010bbde243ea50cb9f5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c254b49a1f748dfc488d010bbde243ea50cb9f5f/0_83_4168_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The European Central Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The European Central Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Roland/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Admittedly, the euro still rebounded after President Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remark that ECB interest rates have may have bottomed out, but it is hard to believe that was the outcome he intended. Indeed, the equity markets of both the euro-zone and (especially) Japan have stuttered as a result of the appreciation of their respective currencies. ECB officials have since reinforced the message that policy could be loosened further if required. And while the Bank of Japan did opt to leave monetary policy settings on hold in March, it left plenty of room for additional easing next month.</p> <p>We also think that the markets have read too much into the [Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] latest projections. The median forecast of participants implies that they only expect to raise rates twice this year, but the mean forecast is still consistent with up to three hikes. Either outcome would be a faster pace of tightening than currently priced into fed funds futures. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent dovishness could also soon evaporate if inflation pressures continue to build, even if this means renewed dollar strength.</p> <p>The upshot is that we continue to expect the US currency to resume its climb against the euro and the yen in the coming months, as monetary policy divergence comes back to the fore. The latest survey shows that around 80% of foreign-owned UK financial assets were held in either the euro-zone or the US in the middle of last year, up from around 70% a decade or so ago.

                "bodyText":"After a bright start European shares came off their best levels, as the crude price slipped back from its highs after the Baker Hughes rig data. But, apart from the UK market, they still managed to end the day in positive terrirtory after a strong start on Wall Street. The recent rally follows the revival in the oil price on hopes that major producers will agree an output freeze, and the dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve about the prospect of further interest rate rises, which has in turn weakened the dollar. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 may have come within 5 points of those highs for the year, but the upward momentum failed to last as a lack of good news continues to plague the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least in London. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting to note that markets on mainland Europe and in North America continue to wriggle higher, but with factors like oil failing to extend its gains also in play and a resurgent pound hitting sterling-denominated assets in general, the mood is decidedly muted. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 11.48 points or 0.19% to 6189.64, but still ended up 0.8% on the week Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.59% to 9950.80 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.44% higher at 4462.51 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.02% to 18,611.34 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.81% better at 9051.1 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 88 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Baker Hughes rig count showing oil rigs up by one, but gas rigs falling: The number of oil rigs drilling in the US has climbed for the first time in 12 weeks, according to the Baker Hughes rig count, albeit by just one rig. The news has sent crude prices falling again after their early gains. Brent crude is now down 0.2% at $41.45 a barrel, well down on its earlier level of $42.54. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is 0.5% lower at $39.96 a barrel. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings agency S&amp;P on Russia: S&amp;P said Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings remained constrained by the weak political institutions which are impeding the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness. On sanctions, it expected them to remain in place over its forecasting period. Earlier we reported the idea that central bankers meeting in Shanghai last month may have made a secret deal to prevent the dollar strengthening any further. But economist Julian Jessop at research group Capital Economics is not convinced: The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further slide since this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [US Federal Reserve] meeting has increased speculation that G20 officials meeting in Shanghai last month came to some sort of deal to end the US currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength. But this speculation makes no sense on close inspection. The speculative story runs something as follows. Central bankers in the advanced economies are worried about the market volatility that might be caused by further strength in the US dollar. Specific concerns presumably include the impact on US corporate earnings, additional weakness in commodity prices, financial strains in emerging markets with large external debts, and a greater risk that the [Chinese central bank] would undertake a major devaluation of the renminbi. In this narrative, central bankers have agreed to coordinate monetary policies to cap the dollar against other major currencies. Consistent with this, the communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 said a little more than usual on currencies, adding a new commitment to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consult closely on exchange markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the dollar has indeed weakened against both the euro and the yen since the meeting concluded in late- February. In turn, this has allowed the renminbi to fall slightly further on a trade-weighted basis, despite a small appreciation against the US currency. However, we doubt that Shanghai marked a lasting turning point. For a start, the new language in the communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 went only very slightly further than previous warnings about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and commitments to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrain from competitive devaluations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moreover, the dollar had peaked against both the euro and (particularly) the yen some months earlier. Above all, since the G20 the ECB has unveiled a package of bold stimulus measures that might have been expected to weaken the euro. Admittedly, the euro still rebounded after President Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remark that ECB interest rates have may have bottomed out, but it is hard to believe that was the outcome he intended. Indeed, the equity markets of both the euro-zone and (especially) Japan have stuttered as a result of the appreciation of their respective currencies. ECB officials have since reinforced the message that policy could be loosened further if required. And while the Bank of Japan did opt to leave monetary policy settings on hold in March, it left plenty of room for additional easing next month. We also think that the markets have read too much into the [Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] latest projections. The median forecast of participants implies that they only expect to raise rates twice this year, but the mean forecast is still consistent with up to three hikes. Either outcome would be a faster pace of tightening than currently priced into fed funds futures. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent dovishness could also soon evaporate if inflation pressures continue to build, even if this means renewed dollar strength. The upshot is that we continue to expect the US currency to resume its climb against the euro and the yen in the coming months, as monetary policy divergence comes back to the fore. The latest survey shows that around 80% of foreign-owned UK financial assets were held in either the euro-zone or the US in the middle of last year, up from around 70% a decade or so ago. (See Chart.) It also reveals that the amounts of UK financial assets that are held in the euro-zone and the US are broadly similar, even though the UK does approximately four times as much trade with the euro-zone than it does with the US. Breaking news Just ahead of the bid deadline, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has unveiled its \u00c2\u00a31.4bn offer for Home Retail Group, including a special dividend. It values the Argos owner at 173.2p a share. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says that after due diligence it expects a higher level of synergies from the deal, up from \u00c2\u00a3120m to \u00c2\u00a3160m. Wall Street is moving sharply higher, German and French markets are in positive territory but the FTSE 100 has fallen back into the red. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Risk appetite is fading as the session heads to its close, with the FTSE 100 back in the red, ten points lower from the open. The 6200 level continues to stand in the way of the FTSE 100, with the five-week rally stymied for lack of good news. European markets are still in positive territory, although they are also off their highs. A rally needs momentum, and the lack of it on the FTSE over the past few sessions sends a warning that the last two weeks of March may not see the same bullish atmosphere that dominated of late. Looking forward, however, a weaker US dollar, stronger commodity prices and supportive central banks would seem to bode well for more gains into April and May, particularly given the way dips in oil continue to be furiously bought. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest Home Retail story, from Sarah Butler: Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is on course to take over Home Retail Group for \u00c2\u00a31.4bn after South African retail group Steinhoff said it had ditched plans to make a rival bid for the Argos owner. Steinhoff, which owns furniture chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK, released a statement to the stock exchange in London confirming its withdrawal on Friday afternoon. Home Retail Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares dived about 11% and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell just over 3% on the news that Steinhoff had withdrawn. Markus Jooste, CEO of Steinhoff, said Home Retail was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compelling business with unique attributes that remains attractive on many fronts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and expressed appreciation for the professional manner in which the company had handled the bid process. But he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having concluded our due diligence review and ancillary discussions, we have evaluated our findings against our investment criteria and today come to a decision not to proceed with a firm intention announcement and offer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: Steinhoff did have other things on its plate - its French business Conforama has agreed to buy electrical retailer Darty. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Butler on the South African group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other deals from our story earlier: Steinhoff, which has an international retail empire, is currently working on a number of other deals. Some analysts believe Steinhoff may lose interest in Home Retail if the price gets too high as it also currently bidding for electrical goods retailer Darty in France and is also rumoured to be looking at Australian electronics chain The Good Guys. It is also backing the expansion of Pep &amp; Co, a new budget clothing chain being developed by Andy Bond, the former boss of UK supermarket chain Asda. Home Retail shares have fallen 6% after the sudden end to the bid battle for the Argos owner. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares, by contrast, have climbed 0.3%, on the basis that it may not now have to raise its offer to \u00c2\u00a31.5bn. Breaking news: South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steinhoff has just announced it will not make an offer for Argos owner Home Retail ahead of a 5pm deadline., clearing the way for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. As well as weak consumer confidence figures from the US, there has also been downbeat data from Belgium and the Netherlands. In Belgium confidence fell for the third month to a five month low of -7 in March, while in the Netherlands it slipped to a 13 month low of -4. Economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: Early signs for consumer confidence across the Eurozone in March are not good, with declines in the Netherlands (to a 13-month low) and in Belgium (to a 5-month low). This will fuel concern over whether consumers will help Eurozone GDP growth to pick up in the near term from current lacklustre levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though the fundamentals for consumers still look pretty decent. With the race to the White House well underway, politics could be playing a part in the US confidence figures, says James Knightley at ING Bank: Both the current conditions and the expectations components dropped, which is a bit disappointing given the rebound in equities and the strength in the labour market It could partially be down to the rise in gasoline prices from around $1.70 a gallon as the mid-point for the national average for February versus $1.97 a gallon as it stood yesterday (AAA data). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that politics may also be weighing on sentiment given the preponderance of negative sound-bites. Nonetheless, we expect consumer spending to hold up given positive real wage growth and rising employment. Interestingly one year and 5-10 year inflation expectations rose to 2.7%, which is supportive of the Fed rate hike story. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said: Consumer confidence eased in early March due to increased concerns about prospects for the economy as well as the expectation that gas prices would inch upward during the year ahead.... While consumers do not anticipate a recession, they no longer expect the economy to outperform the 2.4% rate of economic growth recorded in the past two years. US consumers were less confident in March than expected, according to the latest University of Michigan survey. Its index fell from 91.7 in February to 90, down on the expected figure of 92.2. Positive signs from the Chinese economy are also giving some support to markets, particularly commodity companies as metal prices move higher. Copper climbed to a four month high after Chinese house prices rose at their fastest rate for almost two years in February. According to Reuters figures, prices climbed 3.6% compares to 2.5% in January. Wall Street has carried on where it left off on Thursday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average turned positive for the year. The Dow is up another 53 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.15% higher and Nasdaq 0.22% better. Rising oil prices, along with the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish comments on interest rates this week, is helping sentiment among investors. At the moment however, oil prices are far from sliding. Quite the reverse. Brent crude is up more than 2% at $42.43 a barrel, its highest level since December. Investors are hoping that Opec and other oil producers can agree to freeze output, despite reluctance from Iran which has just returned to world markets. At the same time there are signs the supply glut may be stabilising. The US Energy Information Administration said this week that crude inventories rose by 1.3m barrels last week, but this was less than the 3.4m increase analysts had been expecting. Also helping crude is weakness in the dollar following the US Federal Reserve trimming its expectations for further interest rate rises this year. A fall in the dollar makes oil more affordable to holders of other currencies. The slide in the oil price has driven down Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Prices were 1.4% higher year-on-year in February, down from 2% in January, and 0.2% higher month-on-month. Back in the markets, shares in developing countries have hit their highest levels since last December. The benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets index (MSCIEF), is up 0.8% on track for its third third weekly gain in a row. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general relief that the US Federal Reserve is pledging to be cautious when normalising monetary policy; calming fears of capital outflows from emerging markets [EM] into the dollar. Per Hammarlund, chief EM strategist at SEB, explains: This latest rally has been driven by renewed appetite for EMs due to fewer rate hikes in the U.S Speaking of Russia.... Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new rating agency is now open for business. The venture, called ACRA, is Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to hit back at the Western rating agencies which recently downgraded Russia to junk status. Russian officials say ACRA will give valuable new insight into the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporations, at a time when Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch are reducing their monitoring of the country. However.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable cynicism about ACRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. As Paul McNamara of asset management firm GAM puts it (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any Russian agency would undoubtedly be regarded as being in the pocket of the Kremlin.... [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] a standard response to being downgraded. Nobody in the market cares.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Newsflash from Moscow: The Russian central bank has left interest rates unchanged at an eye-wateringly high 11%. With inflation around 7%, the Bank of Russia clearly felt unable to ease monetary policy even though the country is in recession. In a statement, it warns that inflation risks remain high, despite recent stabilisation in the financial markets. And inflation could get a kick higher this summer due \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbase effects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (because the oil price will no longer be lower than a year ago). So rates could remain high for longer than expected. This chart shows how the ECB has already driven interest rates down to record lows, putting a radical move like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchelicopter money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the agenda: A senior European Central Bank policymaker has excited the markets by hinting that eurozone interest rates could be cut again. Peter Praet, an ECB executive board member, told the La Repubblica newspaper that further stimulus measures are possible. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new package of interest rate cuts, cheaper credit and quantitative easing is not the final throw of the dice, Praet insisted. He said: This re-composition of the tool-box does not mean that we have thrown away any of our tools. If new negative shocks should worsen the outlook or if financing conditions should not adjust in the direction and to the extent that is necessary to boost the economy and inflation, a rate reduction remains in our armoury. And if all else fails, Praet says the ECB could even embark on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchelicopter money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and physically press cash into the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands, to force inflation up. Asked if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in principle the ECB could print cheques and send them to people?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Praet says: Yes, all central banks can do it. You can issue currency and you distribute it to people. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helicopter money. Helicopter money is giving to the people part of the net present value of your future seigniorage, the profit you make on the future banknotes. The question is, if and when is it opportune to make recourse to that sort of instrument which is really an extreme sort of instrument. There are other things you can theoretically do. There are several examples in the literature. So when we say we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the limit of the toolbox, I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true. This commitment to fresh stimulus has weakened the euro, sending it down 0.3% to $1.127, and also pushed shares higher in France and Germany. Europe still has a deflation problem, according to the latest measure of prices charged by German manufacturers at the factory gate. German producer prices fell by 3% year-on-year in February, a bigger fall than expected, partly due to a 9.4% slump in energy prices. Marilyn Watson at fund manager BlackRock told Bloomberg TV this morning that the US dollar should stabilise as traders take stock of recent developments. She believe investors are less worried about a slump in the Chinese yuan, and have also taken the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent cautious tone on board. Tony Cross, Trustnet Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market analyst, agrees that the Fed is supporting the markets: Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish note by the Federal Reserve may be continuing to lend support to global equity markets, with a weaker US dollar encouraging a risk-on mindset amongst many. European markets are pretty stable this morning, after seeing Wall Street hit 2016 highs last night. Mining companies are continuing to push higher, due to the weaker US dollar pushing up commodity prices. Money is still pouring into Japanese government debt today, following the recent imposition of negative interest rates. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sending the rate of return on 10-year bonds to a new record low, further below zero. Speculation is swirling that central bankers have made a secret deal to prevent the US dollar strengthening any further. The theory is that global policymakers cooked up a plan when they met in Shanghai in last month, amid worries that the surge of money into the greenback was destabilising markets and fuelling deflation (by driving commodity prices downwards). Chris Weston of IG explains: To any conspiracy theorists it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all become quite clear. There is a global coordinated central bank effort to weaken the US dollar in play. He points out that many central banks have surprised the markets with fresh stimulus in the past few weeks (hello, Mario Draghi), or been much more dovish than expected (take a bow, Janet Yellen): Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China easing the Reserve Ratio Requirements (RRR) by 50 basis points, the RBNZ cutting its cash rate by 25 basis points (very much out of consensus), or the ECB moving to a focus on credit markets and going significantly above and beyond expectations. Of course, then we also have the Fed, who missed the economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 modestly hawkish playbook by about as wide a margin as we will likely see. Joachim Fels, global economic advisor at bond-trading firm PIMCO, also suspects something is afoot. He told Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There seems to be some kind of tacit Shanghai Accord in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The agreement is to roughly stabilize the dollar versus the major currencies through appropriate monetary policy action, not through intervention.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The promise of stimulus measures and easy monetary policy is sending world stock markets rallying. Last night, the Dow Jones industrial average turned positive for the year, putting the turmoil of January and February behind it. And that has fed through to Asia, where most markets have posted gains. The weaker US dollar is helping. It suffered its biggest losses since 2009 yesterday, after the US Federal Reserve admitted on Wednesday that it only expects to raise interest rates twice this year, not four times as previously pencilled in. Reuters has the details of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian action. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8%, entering positive territory for the year for the first time. It is up 2.3% this week,and has surged 10.4% this month. The Hang Seng index was up 0.6 percent, heading for a weekly rise of 3.6%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index and CSI 300 climbed about 1.9%,and were set for gains of about 6.4% for the week. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is missing out on the rally, though. Shares are being dragged down because the yen has risen against the US dollar, hurting Japanese exporters and hurting hopes of higher inflation. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by talk about the global economy, and central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to improve the situation and ward off a crash. But Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, has given world leaders a clear message -- don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on us for everything. Speaking to reporters in Brussels last night during an EU summit on the refugee crisis, Draghi revealed he had told politician to do their bit and reform their economies. The ECB chief said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I made clear that even though monetary policy has been really the only policy driving the recovery in the last few years, it cannot address some basic structural weaknesses of the eurozone economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For that you need structural reforms, mostly driven to raise the level of demand, public investments and lower taxes. Even more importantly, one needs clarity on the future of our ... monetary union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi is notorious for avoiding reporters on these occasions; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a great ability to move like a cat through the press who doorstep these summits. So when he stops to talk, he really wants his message out there. And perhaps he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried that the new stimulus package announced by the ECB last week is going to encourage EU leaders to take their eye off the ball. Also coming up today.... UK supermarket chain Sainsbury, and South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steinhoff International, both have until 5pm GMT to launch a new takeover bid for Argos, the British catalogue retailer: Theres not much in the economic calendar, but we do get the latest count of US oil rigs this afternoon. That may show that more producers bailed out, due to the pressure of lower crude prices. 12.30pm: Canadian inflation for February 2pm: The University of Michigan survey of US consumer confidence 5pm: The US Baker Hughes US rig count We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the events through the day",

                "bodyText":"A trading week shortened by the Easter break got off to a fairly uninspiring start. European markets ended slightly lower in the main, despite a strong performance from the Chinese market overnight. Weaker commodity shares proved a drag on the markets as metal prices steadied after recent gains, and oil drifted lower before turning higher again after comments from Opec. There was little economic data to distract investors, although what there was - US home sales, UK factory output and European confidence figures - proved disappointing. The pound continued to fall after the resignation of work and pensions minster Ian Duncan Smith raised new Brexit concerns. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 5.06 points or 0.08% at 6184.58 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.02% to 9948.64 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.78% lower at 4427.80 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.46% to 18,696.93 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.33% at 9021.0 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.25% to 541.70 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 22 points or 0.13% after an earlier decline. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again tomorrow. Oil prices are moving higher again after Opec secretary general Abdalla Salem el-Badri said all members of the oil producing group will be invited to a meeting on April 17. A number of producers want to freeze output at January levels in order to deal with a supply glut that has pushed crude prices sharply lower. El-Badri said Iran had no objection to the April meeting but has some conditions on its production. He said the only problem in the market at the moment was an overhang of 300m barrels, reports Reuters. Brent crude is currently up 0.29% to $41.32 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has climbed 1.3% to $39.99. As markets drifted lower Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a disappointing start to the week for the FTSE-100, with sentiment not quite seeming able to keep pace with the fundamentals. Oil prices had been seen as weighing on the commodity stocks in trade earlier this morning but despite WTI crude breaking back above $40/barrel, the reaction in London has been rather muted. Admittedly we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re scraping a finish that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as good as unchanged, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a spring-like hop towards fresh highs for the year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on troubled pharmaceutical group Valeant: The chief executive of Valeant resigned on Monday, after the embattled Canadian drugmaker admitted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improper conduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by senior management caused the company to misstate its financial results. Michael Pearson, who had returned to the helm last week after more than two months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sick leave with pneumonia, said he regretted the controversies the company has caused and will leave as soon as a successor is found. The company has also appointed the activist hedge fund investor William Ackman to its board. Valeant was a stock market darling under Pearson, who developed a strategy of buying up companies and dramatically increasing the price of undervalued drugs. However, such a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153price gouging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy has been attacked by both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and Valeant was called before Congress to explain. Two state attorney generals have opened investigations into the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drug pricing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I regret the controversies that have adversely impacted our business over the past several months, I know that Valeant is a strong and resilient company, and I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure a smooth transition to new leadership,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pearson said in a statement. While Pearson was on leave, Howard Schiller, former chief financial officer and a board member, took over as interim CEO. On Monday the company said Schiller had been asked to leave the board but had refused. The full story is here: The confidence figures are a worrying sign since consumers are key to future growth in the eurozone, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. He said: A blow for Eurozone growth hopes as the European Commission reported overall consumer confidence weakened for a third month running in March - to be at a 15-month low. This will fuel concern over whether consumers will help eurozone GDP growth to pick up in the near term from current lacklustre levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though the fundamentals for consumers still look pretty decent. No breakdown is available yet of eurozone confidence in March but it seems significant that sentiment was yet again brought down in the Netherlands (to a 13-month low) and, to a lesser extent, in Belgium (to a five-month low) by increased concerns over the economy. Job worries were also up modestly in Belgium as were concerns over personal financial situations. Interestingly though, the index measuring consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to buy rose in March in the Netherlands. Consumer confidence in Europe has fallen back so far in March, according to an initial survey by the European Commission. It slipped 0.9 points to -9.7 in the eurozone, and dipped 0.7 points to -7.3 in the wider European Union. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: With more than half of the members of the eurozone now in deflation, including Germany, France and Italy, it is little surprise that consumer confidence is plummeting. ECB president Mario Draghi is quickly running out of options, and the looming UK referendum on EU membership in June is serving up a large dish of insecurity across Europe. Uncertainly looks set to stay, as many observers predict another summer of increased economic migration, while pivotal upcoming elections in Germany and France could drastically change their political stances. Consumers may not be too confident for some time. Peter Praet, an executive board member of the European Central Bank, said last week that if other stimulus measures failed, the bank could even embark on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchelicopter money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and physically press cash into the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands, to force inflation up. Unsurprisingly, this idea seems to have gone down badly with the Bundesbank. Jens Weidmann, president of the German central bank, has reportedly warned of the dangers of helicopter money on bank balance sheets. Bloomberg reports: Weidmann warned against starting a discussion about handing out cash to stimulate growth, Funke Mediengruppe reported, citing an interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Helicopter money isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manna falling from heaven, but would rip huge holes in central bank balance sheets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weidmann, who heads Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bundesbank, said, according to the newspaper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The euro area states and taxpayers would pay the bill in the end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ECB President Mario Draghi expanded the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond purchases and offer of cheap loans to banks this month to help stoke inflation. While monetary conservatives, including those at the Bundesbank, have warned against such steps, other ECB policy makers suggest they could go further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of suggesting ever more reckless monetary policy experiments, it would make sense to pause,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weidmann was cited as saying in German. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monetary policy is not a panacea, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replace the necessary reforms in individual countries and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve all of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth problems.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said: Sales took a considerable step back in most of the country last month, and especially in the Northeast [down 17.1%] and Midwest [13.8%,lower]. The lull in contract signings in January from the large East Coast blizzard, along with the slump in the stock market, may have played a role in February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of closings. However, the main issue continues to be a supply and affordability problem. Finding the right property at an affordable price is burdening many potential buyers. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some bad news from the US housing market with existing home sales falling sharply in February. The National Association of Realtors said home sales (excluding newly built houses) dropped by 7.1% to an annual rate of 5.08m, which is the lowest level since November. That compares to expectations of a fall of around 3% to 5.31m. Home sales have been volatile since the introduction of new mortgage regulations in October intended to help buyers shop around for the best loans suited to their financial circumstances. The new figures follow the US Federal Reserve deciding last week not to raise interest rates again after its December hike. Also on the way up in the US are Starwood Hotels, up 4% after an increased $13.6bn offer from Marriott, and business research group IHS, nearly 6% higher following news of a deal to buy data group Markit. With European markets edging down after a mixed morning, Wall Street has followed suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 11 points lower, as last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally ran out of steam. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.16% while Nasdaq has dipped a similar amount. But controversial pharmaceutical company Valeant has jumped 5% after news its chief executive was being replaced, although its finance director has refused a request to leave. Drama on Wall Street! Valeant, the trouble pharmaceutical company which has admitted misstating its financial results, has just announced that CEO Michael Pearson is stepping down. The search for a successor is underway, adding further uncertainty to Valeant just days after it delayed the publication of its annual report. In a statement, Pearson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I regret the controversies that have adversely impacted our business over the past several months, I know that Valeant is a strong and resilient company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another development, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is joining the board. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a big investor in Valeant, and has suffered huge losses since the company began facing charges of price-gouging and sales mis-practices. But perhaps the most surprising news is that Valeant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board have accused former chief financial officer Howard Schiller of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improper conduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They have asked Schiller to resign as a director, but he has not followed this request (!) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nifty GIF, showing how the UK government could raise \u00c2\u00a34.4bn to replace the abandoned cuts to disability benefits: With the pound still down, analysts are wondering if Iain Duncan Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock resignation could seriously dent confidence in the government. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the crisis could highlight David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaknesses: Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget is looking increasingly troubled too. MPs are due to vote on it this week, even though the Treasury has pulled a a screeeeeching u-turn and abandoned plans to cut disability payments by \u00c2\u00a34bn. Chancellor George Osborne has even been given a vote of confidence.... French business chief Henri de Castries has moved a step closer to becoming the next chairman of banking giant HSBC. De Castries resigned as chief executive of insurance group AXA this morning, where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worked for the last 27 years. And that has heightened speculation that he could replace Douglas Flint at HSBC. Our City editor Jill Treanor reports that de Castries was already in the frame, having recently become a director at the bank: The 61-year old was appointed to the board of HSBC last year as a non-executive director and is now cited a candidate to replace Douglas Flint who revealed on Friday that a search was underway for his successor. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank has already promised that its next chairman will not be selected from its top management team - breaking with tradition - and appoint an outsider to the role. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector suffered another drop in March, according to the latest CBI Industrial Trends Survey. The survey found that output volumes over the three months to March fell at the fastest pace since September 2009, with 8 of the 18 manufacturing sub-sectors posted a decline in output. Some factories are also struggling to win new orders; 20% of firms reported total order books to be above normal, and 34% said they were below normal, giving a balance of -14%. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Director of Economics, sees signs of improvement, though, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153March has been a mixed month for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers. Whilst total order and export books remained steady, a drop in output reflected some volatility in the food and drink sector. Reassuringly, manufacturers expect a swift turnaround in activity. European stock markets have shaken off their early losses, sending Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX up by 0.7%. Sterling is still suffering from the political tensions in Britain, says CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Lawler: The British pound was an underperformer in currency markets after the resignation of MP and former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith. A bit of internal party bickering doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally impact Sterling but this time it has because of the possible implications for Brexit. Two data companies that we quote a lot in this liveblog are merging. IHS Global Insight, home of Jane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Defence Weekly and the ever-quotable analyst Howard Archer, is buying UK rival Markit in an all-share deal. Markit are probably best known for their Purchasing Managers Indices, or PMIs, which provide a regular snapshot of how The deal values Markit at $5.9bn; the combined company will be worth $13bn. A hefty sum, which shows the value of economic data. The CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses, has also waded into the EU referendum debate. In a new report, it warns that Brexit could cost....\u00c2\u00a3100 billion pounds (a figure which is crying out for a Dr Evil impression) Moneyweek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editor in chief, Merryn Somerset Webb, argues that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to be totally confident about such a forecast: Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart, is hopeful that Britain will avoid a sterling crisis. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, he predicts the pound will hover at current levels until June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum is much closer. He tells me: I would expect sterling to loiter around $1.40 unless and until Brexit really looked like winning. A recent Reuters poll found that City economists were split 50:50 over whether the pound would really slump if the public vote to leave the EU. A total of 35 out of 69 predicted a full blown sterling crisis, which would have very serious implications for the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to handle its balance of payments deficit. Winter also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe Iain Duncan Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation will shake the City too much. IDS was a disaster as Tory leader and is no firebrand. Many people believe he was out of his depth in implementing Universal Credits. I also doubt he is a market-mover. George &amp; Dave are undoubtedly wounded, but this profits Boris* more than Labour (except Sadiq Khan who was set to win the London mayoralty race anyway). I think investors will keep calm as they know Boris does not really believe in Brexit! * - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor George Osborne, prime minister David Cameron and outgoing London mayor Boris Johnson (a Brexit supporter and front-runner to succeed Cameron one day) Richard Benson, head of portfolio investment at currency managers Millennium Global in London, also believes the pound is suffering from the aftermath of Iain Duncan Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. He told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling does not normally react strongly to UK politics so this is probably due to Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The referendum is just making people focus on issues like this a lot more. It is down in response this morning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling has been falling this morning, after work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith sensationally resigned late on Friday. The pound fell by almost one cent against the US dollar, hitting a low of $1.4377. It is also down 0.4% against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2803. Although the moves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge, the City is taking note of Duncan Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock decision to quit, and his attack on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeeply unfair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 budget announced last week. It has exposed serious splits at the heart of the government, with some MPs supporting his criticism. IDS has denied that his resignation is motivated by June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union. But he is one of the most senior Brexit supporters, so his move to the back benches could intensity the battle over the EU. Kit Juckes, top foreign exchange strategist at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, says the Tory infighting could hurt the pound (which had rallied last week). The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, will simply add another layer of political risk to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to dominate conversations, and the most alarming comment I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard so far was from a business student at a talk I gave last week: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d quite like the Uk to leave the EU, just to see what happened\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Young educated Londoners are natural in favour of Europe and if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re torn between rebelling and not bothering to vote at all (older voters are much more likely to turn up at the ballot box, but also more likely to vote to leave the EU), that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well. The row has also put Chancellor George Osborne under particular scrutiny. The opposition Labour party are calling for his resignation, after he cut disability benefit while also offering tax cuts to wealthier citizens. Our politics liveblog will have all the action, here: European Central Bank policymaker Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 is urging eurozone politicians to create closer economic and monetary union, or risk seeing the European project unravel. Speaking in Paris right now, C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 says European member states much achieve closer convergence, and create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a euro area treasury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to manage financial stability and implement fiscal tools. He also warns that the ECB can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be expected to solve Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic problems on its own - something ECB chief Mario Draghi has been repeatedly warning too. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 concludes his speech by warning that public against Europe is growing. The progress of European integration has increased interdependence between Member States. But we still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drawn all the necessary conclusions and European politicians still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools that would allow them to respond to the expectations placed on them. This shortcoming feeds popular frustration with European policies, sometimes to the point that they question European integration itself. There is nothing inevitable about the status quo, but, to move forward, we need to redefine a common project. It will take many years to implement this project. It is all the more urgent to start defining it. The rally in Chinese shares has not fed through to Europe. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 dropped by 30 points, or 0.3%, at the start of trading. Natural resource stocks are leading the fallers, with Glencore and Anglo American losing 2.8%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suffering because the US dollar has recovered some strength (pushing down commodity prices). Commodities has already been a good way of losing money over the last decade: IMF chief Christine Lagarde has offered Beijing some support over the weekend. Speaking at the start of the China Development Forum, Lagarde said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest five-year plan would help rebalance the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Lagarde also said China was going through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a historic transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good for China and good for the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the official Xinhua news agency. Xinhua: Lagarde backs China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 13th Five-Year Plan China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new encouragement for speculative stock market borrowing is part of a broader stimulus push, argues Chris Weston of IG. He writes: The Chinese government is clearly pining for the days of yore when domestic stocks and property investment both moved up in tandem. The China Securities Finance Corporation loosened controls on margin lending on Friday and Chinese markets have responded in kind, rallying aggressively as soon as they reopened. Heavy fiscal spending on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part has helped restart property construction in 2016, while monetary easing and weakening home purchase downpayment requirements have helped spur property sales. Weston suspects some policymakers have their own careers in mind... One wonders whether part of the reason behind this stimulatory push is due to the fact that top members of the Chinese leadership are positioning themselves for the five out of seven Politburo Standing Committee seats that will become available at 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19th Party Congress. A flurry of buying activity has ripped through China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market today, after Beijing relaxed rules designed to prevent a bubble. The Shanghai composite index has spiked by over 2% to close at 3,020 points, a gain of 64 points, despite concerns over the Chinese economy. The trigger was news that Beijing will resume offering cheap loans to stock brokerages, which they can pass onto traders looking to invest in Chinese companies. Bloomberg has the details: China Securities Finance Corp., the state-backed agency that provides funding to brokerages for margin trading, will restart offering loans to securities firms for periods ranging from 7 days to 182 days, according to a statement posted on its website Friday. The agency will cut interest rates on the debt to as low as 3 percent, it said. So the scent of cheap money has its predictable effect on the trading floors. But investors perhaps shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away. Over the weekend, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China governor, warned that corporate debt levels are too high. A hint of defaults and debt restructurings to come? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the recent drama from central bankers, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a calmer feeling in the markets this morning. And with not much data in the calendar, it could be a bit of a drag. Still, all isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost, as two European Central Bank policymakers are out and about this morning. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top man at the ECB, Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9, is talking about governance in the eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a cause of perennial worry for those who fear that politicians aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing enough to tackle the debt crisis. And vice-president V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio is in a cloudy London, discussing ways of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expanding market-based finance for sustainable growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So that might yield some news. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 7.45am GMT: Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 speaks in Paris 9am: Eurozone current account for January 9.30am: Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio speaks in London 11am: CBI survey of UK industrial trends We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching for any signs that investors are worried about the civil war raging in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative party: And there could be action in Greece, too, where negotiations over its bailout programme are dragging, again....",

It will be difficult to put an exact figure not just on the cost of lost tourism, the heartbeat of most cities, but of the extra security needed to combat the terrorists. Airlines and tour operators, the likes of TUI, IAG, Intercontinental Hotels and Carnival, all fell.</p> </blockquote> <p>So after recovering from their immediate falls, the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 finished up 0.13% or 8.16 points at 6192.74</li> <li>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.42% to 9990.00</li> <li>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.09% at 4431.97</li> <li>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was virtually flat, up just 0.01% to 18,698.89</li> <li>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8992.0</li> <li>In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 544.30</li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 9 points or 0.05%.</p> <p>Gold has added $4 an ounce to $1247 as investors sought havens amid the uncertainty, while Brent crude is up 0.46% to $41.73, recovering from earlier falls.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

The OBR confirmed before the budget last week that the chancellor would miss his target of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament.</p> <p>It also said the welfare cap would be breached in every year under the current projections for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. But Osborne remains on target to create a surplus in five years, achieving his third target. However, as a result of the PIP U-turn, it might not be as large as the \u00c2\u00a310m indicated in the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections.</p> <p>Chote said there was still a 55% chance of the budget surplus being achieved.

                "bodyText":"Despite falls in travel and leisure shares in the wake of the explosions in Belgium, stock markets managed to hold firm amid the latest terrorist attacks. Even the hard hit holiday and airline companies managed to recover from their lows, and Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The sad reality is that the more frequent these kinds of events become, the more markets become immune and the response in prices becomes less dramatic. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The FTSE 100 showed some resilience on Tuesday following the latest terrorist atrocities to befall a major European city... Stockmarkets immediately came under pressure, but having falling sharply after the attack London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index managed to recover.. its losses. Amid the chaos, however, uncertainty lingered over how much this attack would disrupt travel across Europe. It will be difficult to put an exact figure not just on the cost of lost tourism, the heartbeat of most cities, but of the extra security needed to combat the terrorists. Airlines and tour operators, the likes of TUI, IAG, Intercontinental Hotels and Carnival, all fell. So after recovering from their immediate falls, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.13% or 8.16 points at 6192.74 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.42% to 9990.00 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.09% at 4431.97 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was virtually flat, up just 0.01% to 18,698.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 8992.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 544.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 9 points or 0.05%. Gold has added $4 an ounce to $1247 as investors sought havens amid the uncertainty, while Brent crude is up 0.46% to $41.73, recovering from earlier falls. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the appearance of Robert Chote of the Office for Budget Responsibility before the Treasure Select Committee. Phillip Inman writes: The Treasury will breach its self-imposed welfare cap by \u00c2\u00a320bn over the duration of the current parliament following the U-turn on disability benefits, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending watchdog has confirmed. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the reversal of a cut in personal independence payments (PIPs)would add another \u00c2\u00a31.3bn a year to a welfare budget that was already \u00c2\u00a32.7bn over a limit set by George Osborne before the general election last May. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said the move would increase the deficit but would not prevent the chancellor from delivering a budget surplus in the year before the next general election. The welfare cap is one of three targets set by Osborne to measure the success of his economic management. The OBR confirmed before the budget last week that the chancellor would miss his target of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament. It also said the welfare cap would be breached in every year under the current projections for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. But Osborne remains on target to create a surplus in five years, achieving his third target. However, as a result of the PIP U-turn, it might not be as large as the \u00c2\u00a310m indicated in the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections. Chote said there was still a 55% chance of the budget surplus being achieved. He also denied that a cut in migration after a possible exit from the EU would throw the chancellor off course. The full story is here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMIs: Preliminary PMIs published by Markit today suggest that, having slowed sharply in February, manufacturing growth in advanced economies remained very weak in March. The flash manufacturing PMIs rose slightly for the euro-zone and US, but fell in Japan. As a result, a weighted average of the three edged down from 51.0 to 50.9, its lowest level since June 2013. On past form, this is consistent with GDP growth in advanced economies of just under 1%. Oil is have a volatile day, falling back following the news of the Brussels attacks before steadying again on hopes that a meeting in April could come to a deal to freeze output at January levels. Brent crude is currently up 0.29% at $41.66 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $40.97. On services, the Richmond Fed said: Activity in the service sector improved in March following February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness... Growth in revenues, employment, and wages strengthened across the board, with particular intensity in the retail subsector. Retail sales rose sharply compared to a month ago, along with gains in big-ticket sales and heavier shopper traffic. Retail inventories increased dramatically. At other services firms, revenues grew modestly. Survey respondents anticipated good business prospects during the six months ahead. The Richmond Fed manufacturing index reading of 22 was the highest since April 2010. The Fed said: Shipments and the volume of new orders increased this month. Employment advanced at a slightly faster pace in March, while average wages grew moderately and the average workweek lengthened. Prices of raw materials and finished goods rose at a faster pace compared to last month. Manufacturers anticipated robust business conditions during the next six months. Firms expected faster growth in shipments and in new orders in the six months ahead. Additionally, survey participants looked for increased capacity utilization and expected order backlogs to grow. Producers looked for vendor lead times to lengthen modestly. Survey participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outlook for the months ahead also included faster growth in average wages and the average workweek, with a pickup in hiring during the next six months. Over the next six months, manufacturers expected faster growth in prices paid and received. Minutes after the Markit manufacturing PMI came in lower than expected, another survey paints a more optmistic picture. The Richmond Federal Reserve composite manufacturing index has jumped to 22 in March compared to -4 in February and an expected level of -1. And the services revenues index was 9 compared to -2 in February. As for US jobs: US manufacturing improved in March but slightly less than expected, according to a new survey. The initial manufacturing PMI index from Markit has come in at 51.4 compared to 51.3 in February and a forecast of 51.9. The new orders index was up from 52.3 to 52.8. Following the attacks in Brussels, US markets have fallen in early trading as investors worry about geopolitical risks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 44 points or 0.24% lower, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.28% and Nasdaq dropped 0.53%. European shares have been gradually falling further during the day, with the FTSE 100 now down 22 points or 0.37%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.57% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.04% lower. But, as is usual when riskier assets are out of favour, gold and silver have both moved higher. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking in parliament now, in the 2016 Budget debate. Andrew Sparrow is covering all the action in his Politics Liveblog: Iain Duncan Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come up, but the former Work and Pensions Secretary was the elephant in the Thatcher Room today. MPs from both sides quizzed the Office for Budget Responsibility over the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U-turn over disability benefits (called PIPs) following IDS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, and the impact on the public finances. And they may be quite happy with the results. 1) Robert Chote has not changed his view that Britain has a 55% chance of achieving a surplus by 2019-2020. The OBR chief confirmed that a \u00c2\u00a34.4bn black hole has now opened up in the budget, after the government confirmed last night that the abandoned PIP savings will not be filled by further cuts to welfare. However, he insists that the impact on the long-term outlook for the UK is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in fiscal terms. 2) Under questioning by John Mann MP, Chote did concede that the \u00c2\u00a34bn black hole will slightly cut the chances that George Osborne hits his fiscal rule. But Chote later agreed that the \u00c2\u00a34bn black hole could be wiped out if the UK grows a little faster than currently forecast. 3) Chote stuck to his statement that George Osborne has shuffled revenue and spending around, helping to keep Britain on track for a surplus in 2019-20. However, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it is actually an accounting wheeze, even though corporation tax changes have been delayed to deliver \u00c2\u00a36bn in revenue in that financial year. 4) The PIP u-turn means the UK government will breach Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare cap by an even wider margin than before, the committee heard. Chote agreed with Rachel Reeves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment that it will blow through the cap by \u00c2\u00a320bn over a five-year period. 5) Chote said that Osborne had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153selectively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quoted the OBR over the EU referendum question. [The chancellor didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell MPs the OBR hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually included Brexit risks in its forecasts]. 6) The committee also exposed some uncertainty over how changes to business rates will hit local councils. They could lose \u00c2\u00a31.7bn once more small firms stop paying rates. 7) The OBR also conceded that households will be running unprecedentedly deeper deficits by 2020. That could raise the risks of a sterling crisis. 8) And finally, Chote also touched on the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track-record of spending the occasional fiscal windfalls provided by OBR forecast changes. Others must judge whether this fine-tuning is sensible, Chote hinted. Committee chair Andrew Tyrie reckons it is not. And finally, Andrew Tyrie turns to the impact of the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasting changes. Are you surprised that the chancellor has decided to change his plans twice a year, in response to your revisions?? George Osborne spent the \u00c2\u00a327bn \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwindfall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which the OBR handed him in the autumn statement, and is now trying to plug a gap at some political cost.... Chote says that there is inevitably some noise in the forecasts OBR produce for the Chancellor. Last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revision was relatively small, compared to previous changes [and has been reversed by the gloomier new forecasts]. So a chancellor must decide how to handle this noise. It has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the revealed preference recently\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for most of those changes to be offset, Chote puts it diplomatically. Only an economist could give that answer, Tyrie response. Chote then explains that it is a consequence of fiscal targets. The Chancellor has clearly seized a \u00c2\u00a310bn surplus as 2019-20 as a desirable feature of successive forecasts It is for others to judge whether the degree of fine-tuning required is a sensible response to the noise in the pre-measures forecasts, or not. We are an environment when many counties are setting fiscal rules, so there is a question about how quickly policymakers respond to forecasting changes. It seems to me, Tyrie replies, that there is a good degree of logic to taking a longer-term view. Chote can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, quite, be persuaded to agree. He says: I can see the logic of your position, but it would be inappropriate of me [to comment]... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not our job to say how policy should be set. Oh Robert, Tyrie sighs. Is there not even the hint of an emotional response? I will save it for my farewell appearance, the OBR chief giggles. And with that, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up and off. Tyrie will surely hold him to that pledge. The hearing is over. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll post a summary now. Jacob Rees-Mogg then turns to the sugar tax. Why do you think there is a \u00c2\u00a31bn set-up cost, before a saving of \u00c2\u00a3500m per year? That \u00c2\u00a31bn cost comes from the inflationary impact of the move. More expensive sugary drinks will raise the inflation rate by 0.25% in the first year, which pushes up the interest rate Britain pays on inflation-linked gilts (called linkers). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small transfer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from drinkers to linkers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Chote says. So will it significantly reduce the consumption of sugar? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something we can answer, Chote says. The OBR has considered how the move will affect customer behaviour, but not exactly what they will drink more and less of. Rees-Mogg: If the sugar tax pushes inflation up, then won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t people on inflation-linked benefits get more money which they can then spend on sugary drinks? Chote suggests that many benefits could still be frozen, rather than rising inline with inflation. Not pensioners, though, thanks to the triple-lock (pensions rise in line with inflation, or by at least 2%) So that means pensioners can still afford tonic with their gin, but young people won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to afford coke, Rees-Mogg concludes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacob Rees Mogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn. The Conservative MP and Brexit supporter turns to the EU referendum: He asks if Chote is happy about the way that George Osborne only quoted part of your statement on the impact of the referendum. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the chancellor rather over-egg the pudding by quoting your line about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative implications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Brexit, but not mentioning that you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually judged the impact? Chote confirms that long-term impact of staying in, or leaving, the EU does not fall within the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-year forecasting horizon. But we have to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153realistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Chote continues. The chancellor only devoted 230 words to our statement - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 230 words in it. But anyone who read the whole statement would understand our position. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first or the last time that things are selectively quoted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Chote continues, but the chancellor didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t misrepresent us. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like when the prime minister misrepresented the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position [by claiming that the OBR said that austerity had not harmed growth] So is being quoted out of context one of the risks of political life, Rees-Mogg asks? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historically not unprecedented, Chote replies. Stephen Hammond then asks about the \u00c2\u00a34bn in disability payment cuts that have been dropped. What sort of improvement to growth figures would we need to cover that? Chote replies that it would only need a very small change to cover \u00c2\u00a34bn, given the size of the UK economy. Conservative MP Stephen Hammond turns to the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccocktail of risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 facing Britain. How much impact did they have on the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts? Most of the downward movement in our forecasts was due to our downgraded view of UK productivity, says Robert Chote, rather than the risks from overseas. Steve Baker then asks what discussions the OBR had with the Treasury over its treatment of the EU referendum, and the Brexit question. We met with the chancellor on the 7th (March) and explained our approach, Robert Chote replies. As usual we sent a draft for checking, they pointed out that we had misinterpreted something Deutsche Bank had said. But that was all. Steve Baker then asks why the OBR thinks government borrowing costs are going to rise, when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve actually been falling steadily. Chote says that the OBR has used financial market expectations What happens if sovereign debt costs keep falling, as much as they can do? Will that affect your forecasts? That will depend why it happens, Chote replies, and whether it is because the global economy is weaker than expected. [Britain can currently sell 10-year gilts at around 1.5% per year, which is close to a record low] Steve Baker MP asks whether Bank of England governor Mark Carney is making the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job harder, when he talks about possible interest rate moves. Robert Chote says that the ability of central bankers to actually move the curve of interest rate expectations is a matter for debate..... Over to Steve Baker, Conservative MP, who thanks the OBR for another excellent report. He then asks why the OBR expects interest rates to dip and not to rise until 2019, while the Bank of England governor has told the committee that the next move is probably up. How do you feel about the Bank of England saying your forecasts are wrong? Robert Chote repeats his earlier point, that the OBR has taken market expectations for interest rate rises. Baker points out that the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that interest rate forecasts, productivity forecasts and oil price forecasts have all been wildly wrong in the past. Is there any value in them? Chote explains that the OBR uses the same approach at the IMF on oil - to use futures prices for the next couple of years. That works sometimes, but not always [not for oil recently] Baker then slips in a jibe about those flawed forecasts: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend them to any student of economics, and indeed astrology.... SNP MP George Kerevan asks the OBR to justify its forecast that UK productivity growth will rise from 0.1% to 2%. A twenty-fold increase! Robert Chote argues that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an unrealistic forecast, as 2% is close to the pre-crisis trend. And his colleague Stephen Nickell explains that productivity was badly hit by the financial crisis and should now recover. However, the OBS has also revised down its productivity forecasts, given improvements since 2008 have been disappointing. Chote says the OBR is trying assess two very different periods - a pre-crisis time of solid productivity, and a post-crisis time of weak productivity. You have to make a judgement about where to draw the line and judge the proper long-term average average. He then points out that US forecasters have subsequently come up with very similar forecasts for productivity. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a defence, argues Kereven. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just picking data that matches your case. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a defence, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fact, Chote says. Rachel Reeves MP is also tweeting the answers to her questions: Helen Goodman MP is tweeting from the hearing: Andrew Tyrie asks Steve Nicholls to clarify his warning about interest rate rises possibly triggering recession. If there was a sharp rise in interest rates, brought about by a large trade deficit hitting the pound, that would have a negative impact on household consumption, Nicholls repeats. Define \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sharp rise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd please. Up to 5%, from 0.5% today, in a year, Nicholls explains. Mark Garnier MP focuses on the risk of a sterling crisis. Could we see a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbad scenario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when the Bank of England is forced to raise interest rates to prop up the pound, just as the economy is deteriorating? The OBR Stephen Nicholls confirms that such a rise in interest rates would cut household consumption. The benefit to some households would be outweighed by the negative consequences - overall consumption would fall, and that would probably lead to a recession. That danger is not in the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central forecast, though. So is there a sniff of the financial crisis? That is certainly not a phrase I would use, Chote. But you can look at the various scenarios we have considered. Conservative Mark Garnier goes next. You are predicting a current account deficit will be 3.5% of GDP in 2010, a surplus of 0.5% of GDP, but a 3% deficit for households. Is that really sustainable? Chote say that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that sort of household deficit in the historical data - so to that extent, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unprecedented. But the current picture of record low interest rates is also unprecedented, leading to various sectoral imbalances. Some economist could look at that picture, and suggest it is a recipe for problems - perhaps a fall in the value of sterling. OBR committee member Stephen Nickell points out, though, that households look in very good shape if you look at the value of their assets against their debts. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had an asset price boom, chairman Andrew Tyrie responds. Rachel Reeves then points out that the OBR has cut its estimate of the household savings ratio from 4.2% to 3.9% -- does that mean that the new ISA changes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to boost saving? Chote suggests this is not a verdict on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes. He says the OBR expects higher consumer spending over the parliament, which will have a knock-on effect on the amount they save. Rachel Reeves turns to the changes to ISAs, which are due to cost \u00c2\u00a32bn. How much of that is due to raising the annual allowance limit from \u00c2\u00a315,000 to \u00c2\u00a320,000, and how much is from the new lifetime ISA? The OBR doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know for sure, but estimate that most (perhaps 80%) is from the new lifetime ISA (designed to encourage under-40s to save by giving then \u00c2\u00a31 for every \u00c2\u00a34 they put in). Reeves explains that she believes the ISA limit changes will really only help the wealthiest. The OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Graham Parker confirms that it will only help those who already save the maximum. Conservative MP Steve Baker, a committee member, is tweeting some charts from the OBR: Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rachel Reeves goes next, with an instruction from Andrew Tyrie to get some more joie de vivre out of Chote. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do my best, she replies, and asks about the welfare cap. Chote confirms that the government is on track to miss its new welfare cap by around \u00c2\u00a320bn over the lifetime of the parliament, due to its u-turn on the personal independence payments (PIP) disability benefit. Mann turns to migration. The ORB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are based on net migration of 900,000 - so can we hit the surplus target if this changes? [perhaps if Britain leaves the EU] Out comes the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts again. Chote explains that they used three different estimates for migration - high, medium, and low. That raises or lowers the surplus by \u00c2\u00a34.5bn, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to take it below zero. Robert Chote breaks into a smile as John Mann turns to the corporation tax \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshuffle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Tyrie calls him up on it - you seem to show particular emotions when this issue comes up, he teases the OBR boss. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just my natural joie de vivre, Chote twinkles. Anyway, what is the chances of the government getting the \u00c2\u00a36bn corporation tax windfall in 2019-20, asks Mann. We give it a medium-low uncertainty, the OBR team explain. Companies have to pay corporation tax*; many other fiscal measure have much higher uncertainty. * - even Google, these days..... Your report predicts that the Bank of England will cut interest rates, John Mann continues. Chote replies that the OBR has looked at what the financial markets are predicting. And those \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswaps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suggest a chance that borrowing costs will come down to a fresh record low this year. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Mann goes next, and returns to the issue of the chances of hitting the surplus by 2019-2020 now that the PIP disability cuts have been ditched. Surely it is less than 55% now, given these savings have been cut? There is still a 55% chance, when measured to the nearest 5%, Chote explains, adding: But yes, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got less money the chance is lower, but not materially lower. But the PIP u-turn creates a \u00c2\u00a34bn black hole, Mann points out. Surely that takes the chances of a surplus down to 50%? Not given the scale of the budget and the various uncertainties, Chote insists. He points to the fan-chart in the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts, which show that the PIP changes will not materially shift the odds. So are you saying yes, or no, asks Tyrie? Chote says: The probability of achieving a surplus is lower. But to the nearest 5% it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still 55% but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closer than 50% than before. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still closer to 55% than 50%, the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Graham Parker adds. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Yes Minister-style \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes and No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd answer. Helen Goodman then asks about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to make extra welfare cuts in this parliament, as part of the disability cuts u-turn. Is it really credible for the government to hit its budget targets, as so many government departments are now ringfenced from cuts? Robert Chote replies that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not up to to the OBR to say if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credible or not. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply a matter of arithmetic that savings must come from the unringfenced areas. Within any given amount, the more you protect the more the unprotected bit is affected, he adds. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helen Goodman asks if the government is compensating local councils for changes to business rates (which mean more small firms will be exempt from paying rates). This prompts a long, and confusing, discussion and much flicking through the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest forecasts. Chote concludes that these changes will cost \u00c2\u00a31.7bn -- and are part of the \u00c2\u00a33.5bn of undefined spending cuts and efficiency changes. But the OBR will report back on exactly whether local councils are being compensated, or not, by the latest budget decisions. Chote gets to the nub of the issue: How are public sector pensions contributing \u00c2\u00a32bn to the fiscal consolidation in 2019-20? Chote says the budget shows that the Treasury will not compensate departments for the cost of public sector pension rises, so the money must come from existing spending. How did the OBR handle the \u00c2\u00a33.5bn of future undefined welfare spending in the budget? Chote says that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to assess exactly how this will effect departmental spending in several years time. So the OBR assumed that some of the money would come from departmental underspending. He also points out that the savings are coming from an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153efficiency review\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not our role to say if they are actually efficiency savings or cuts, he explains, whether you are getting more bang for your buck, or simply less buck. So did the government simply add these undefined savings to make the numbers work? Chote says that governments always set the full envelope of public spending. Have you come under pressure from the government over your forecast, asks Tyrie. Not at all, Chote replies. Tyrie points out that Chote has reported being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd under pressure from the Treasury in the past. He hopes that efforts to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeef up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s memorandum of understanding with the government have helped. The attention that you have brought to this issue has already discouraged that traffic, Chote smiles. Why did you say that the chancellor had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shuffled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd some revenue around in the budget, asks Andrew Tyrie. Chote explains that the government has given UK companies more time to adjust to a new system of quarterly corporation tax changes. And that effect is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c2\u00a310bn of revenue from 2017-18 and 2018-19 to 2019-20 and 2010-2021. Chote says that the biggest change is an extra \u00c2\u00a36bn in 2019-2020 (when the government is aiming for a surplus) Q: So you are calling it a shuffle, not an accounting wheeze? Yes, the treatment is straightforward, Chote says, due to the way that Britain treats corporation tax. Tyrie says that the OBR should assess its policy of only publishing new forecasts before the budget and the autumn statement, rather than reacting when the government changes policy. Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, begins the hearing by asking about the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus target. You attached a 55% probability of the fiscal surplus rule being met by 2019-20, but that was before the government decided to drop plans for PIP disability cuts, says Tyrie. So what is the new probability? Robert Chose says the OBR uses a fan chart to assess the probability of hitting various targets. And given the size of the UK budget, if you take away the \u00c2\u00a31.3bn in PIP payments, you still get a 55% probability of a surplus before the end of the parliament. But clearly if you drilled right down into the numbers, it would be a slightly lower probability. So are you arguing that this is De minimis for the purposes of the 55% probability, asks Tyrie? Yes, the \u00c2\u00a31.3bn is not large in the context of other probabilities, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to downplay the importance of that sum, Chote replies. Over in parliament, the Treasury committee is taking evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility about the 2016 budget. They will hear from: Robert Chote, the OBR chairman Stephen Nickell, a member of the OBR budget responsibility committee Graham Parker, the third member of its budget responsibility committee It is being streamed live here. While consumer inflation is still low, UK house price inflation has hit a 12-month high. UK house prices climbed 7.9% in January compared with the same month last year, the Office for National Statistics says. London and the South East led the way: Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that Osborne is going to miss his budget target, unless there is some tweaking of the data... Chancellor George Osborne is on the brink of breaking his borrowing target for the current financial year. The latest public finance figures, just released, show that Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a37.1bn in February, more than expected. That pushes total borrowing since April 2015 up to \u00c2\u00a370.7bn. Osborne is aiming to borrow \u00c2\u00a372.2bn in the overall financial year, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very likely that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing will push him over the limit. According to the Office for National Statistics, March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing would have to be the lowest since 2004 for Osborne to keep within his target. Fraser Munro of the Office for National Statistics has tweeted the key details: He also flags up how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt is still steadily rising. This chart from the UK inflation report shows that food, drink and transport costs are still cheaper than a year ago, although the pace of the declines is falling. The Office for National Statistics explains: Since the start of 2015, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees. Breaking: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline inflation rate remained at 0.3% annually in February, weaker than economists had expected. Analysts at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investor Services have warned that the budget unveiled by George Osborne last week is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They are unimpressed by the latest economic forecasts, showing weaker growth, and the fact that Britain will borrow more than \u00c2\u00a330bn more than planned between now and 2019. They say: Firstly, the budget incorporates a significant downward revision to the economic growth outlook for the coming years compared to just a few months ago, with real GDP growth now expected to average 2.1% over the 2016-19 period, 0.3 percentage points lower than in the November budget statement. \u00c2\u00bb Secondly, the budget revises deficit forecasts upwards (by between 0.4% and 0.8% of GDP) for each of the next three years.... Hence, compared to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier targets, the pace of fiscal consolidation is now markedly slower, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances will remain weaker for a longer period of time. This is credit negative, given that the UK still has one of the largest budget deficits among its EU peers, such as Austria, Finland (both rated Aaa negative) and comparable to France (Aa2 stable). This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a formal rating decision from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, who stripped Britain of its prized AAA rating in 2013. It does suggest, though, that another downgrade is possible if economic conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improve.... German think tank IFO has reported a rise in economic confidence across Germany. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index has picked up to 106.7 this month, from 105.7 in February. New UK public sector borrowing figure are also released at 9.30am, alongside the inflation numbers. They are expected to show that Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a35.4bn to balance the books in February, following an \u00c2\u00a311.8bn surplus in January. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is growing steadily this month, according to the latest data from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest member. However, there are also signs that demand may be waning. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German composite PMI has come in at 54.1, unchanged from February. As with France, service sector firms reported faster growth while factories are lagging. The flash \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcServices Activity Index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rose to a three-month high of 55.5. The flash Germany Manufacturing PMI, though, dipped to 50.4, from 50.5, showing the slowest growth in 16 months. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, cautions: It looks as if momentum in the German economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead, as slowing new order growth was accompanied by the weakest increase in backlogs of work since the summer of last year. Furthermore, there are signs that subdued demand is now also affecting the labour market, as the rate of job creation eased to a near one-year low. Back to the economic data. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in five months. Strong service sector growth made up for a weaker performance from France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, according to data firm Markit. A much-needed rise in new business helped to push up activity. Its French composite output index, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 51.1 this month, up from 49.3 in February (any reading over 50 = growth). The services sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI jumped to 51.2, from 49.2, but manufacturing dipped to 49.6 from 50.2. \u00ef\u201a\u00a7Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The French private sector economy ended the first quarter on a more positive note, reversing the dip in output seen during February.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are falling in early trading, led by a sharp selloff in airline and holiday firms. That follows an explosion at Brussels Airport around an hour ago, injuring passengers and reportedly causing fatalities (this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t officially confirmed yet, though). Tony Cross of TrustNet Direct explains: The dark cloud of terrorism appears to have returned to haunt European markets this morning with reports of fatal explosions at Brussels airport weighing heavily on sentiment. Companies reliant on tourism are, understandably, leading the stock market fallers. Shares in Thomas Cook slumped by 4.8%; it had already warned today that bookings are down this year, partly due to lower demand for Turkish holidays following a terrorist attack in Istanbul. Rival firm TUI fell by 2%. EasyJet, IAG (owner of British Airways) and Lufthansa are all down over 3%, with hotel groups such as Intercontinental Hotel losing 2.5%. My colleagues are covering the latest developments in Brussels here: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also predicts that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data could raise the chances of UK borrowing costs rising soon. He writes: Unlike the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England has been much more dovish in recent months in respect to its own rate message. This is despite UK economic data being much better than US data, with average earnings in particular rising on a par with those in the US. Furthermore, CPI Inflation has also been rising steadily since November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -0.1%, with another rise expected to 0.4%, from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3%. The rebound in oil prices as well as recent sterling weakness has knocked the scenario of rate rises sometime in 2017. This chart from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report shows how prices finally turned positive recently: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK inflation report could reignite talk of a UK interest rate rise in the not-too-distant future. David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX, believes the consumer prices index could put could show signs of stronger price growth, perhaps to 0.4% from 0.3% in January. Another uptick in the U.K. Consumer Price Index accompanied by stickiness in the core-rate of inflation may boost the appeal of the sterling as it puts increased pressure on the Bank of England to normalize monetary policy sooner rather than later. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target is an inflation rate of 2%, which appears some distance away. Many economists reckon interest rates will remain on hold until 2017, or later, but Song agues that conditions could change. The BoE looks poised to retain its current policy ahead of the U.K. Referendum in June as the Monetary Policy Committee remains unanimous in keeping the benchmark interest rate at the record-low, but increased price pressures may encourage Governor Mark Carney to adopt a more hawkish tone over the coming months as the central bank sees a risk of overshooting the 2% inflation-target over the policy horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet, too quiet, as they say in the old Westerns. But the edgy calm that has broken out in the markets recently could be shaken by a splurge of economic data this morning. The day kicks off with new PMI reports from France and Germany, from 8am GMT. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll show how private sector firms are faring this month; whether output is up or down, exports rising or falling, and employment up or down. Then at 9.3am, the latest UK inflation data could show that prices rose at a faster pace last month. Economists expect the Consumer Prices Index to rise to 0.4%, from 0.3% in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be followed by two new surveys of German business confidence: Traders expect a quiet start to trading, even though several companies are reporting results. In the City, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting financial results from holiday firm Thomas Cook, housebuilder Bellway, building materials group Wolseley, retailer Majestic Wine and City trading firm IG. There will be drama in the UK parliament too. Robert Chote, the head of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, is testifying about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget from 10am GMT. Few would argue the Budget was chancellor George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best work, so Chote should be quizzed about the questionable way Osborne claims he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll reach a surplus by 2019-20, and the \u00c2\u00a34bn black hole created by the disability payment cuts u-turn. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"As the long weekend approaches, stock markets had little inspiration to move in either direction so ended up virtually unchanged, with a couple of exceptions. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE close on Wednesday replicated the atmosphere on trading floors across Europe as London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index finished flat on the day. With little in the way of corporate news or economic data to guide them, most investors decided to stay away, possibly eager not to get left exposed ahead of the long Easter weekend. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 6.37 points or 0.1% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.33% to 10,022.93 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac dipped 0.18% to 4423.98 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.26% to 18,462.88 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.72% at 8927.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.29% to 551.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 33 points or 0.19% lower. Meanwhile with rising US crude inventories again, Brent is down 2.5% at $40.74 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The pound continued to come under pressure on growing uncertainty over the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union. A new poll showed the lead of the Remain campaign slipping, helping push sterling to a one month low against the euro and down more than a cent at $1.4094. The US currency was also supported by a number of hawkish comments from members of the Federal Reserve, who suggested rate rises were still on the cards - perhaps even in April - despite the current market volatility. Low oil prices have failed to give the global economy a lift and could cause serious problems, suggest IMF economists in a new blog post: Oil prices have been persistently low for well over a year and a half now, but as the April 2016 World Economic Outlook will document, the widely anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shot in the arm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the global economy has yet to materialize. We argue that, paradoxically, global benefits from low prices will likely appear only after prices have recovered somewhat and advanced economies have made more progress surmounting the current low interest rate environment.... Persistently low oil prices complicate the conduct of monetary policy, risking further inroads by unanchored inflation expectations. What is more, the current episode of historically low oil prices could ignite a variety of dislocations including corporate and sovereign defaults, dislocations that can feed back into already jittery financial markets. The possibility of such negative feedback loops makes demand support by the global community\u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a range of country-specific structural and financial-sector reforms\u00e2\u20ac\u201call the more urgent. After the select committee meeting with EDF on a new nuclear plant at Hinckley Point, one of its MPs James Heappey has called on the French government to formally confirm the timetable for them to refinance the business. Heappey said: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence session was hugely frustrating. EDF CEO Vincent de Rivaz opened by saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccategorically\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that Hinkley C would go ahead and seeming to confirm that a final investment decision would come in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcearly May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But when pressed to confirm that date, he refused to do so. It is clear from his responses to our questions that despite EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubted commitment to Hinkley, the final decision on the project is entirely in the hands of President Hollande and the French Government. Whatever EDF might want to do, they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the cash to do this unless the French Government agree to their re-capitalisation. EDF clearly expect this to be agreed by May but the UK Government must now seek further assurances from Paris that this timeline is realistic. Here is our report on the committee hearing: Crude prices, which have been supported by hopes that a meeting of producers next month can agree to freeze output to cope with the supply glut, have slipped back after new US inventory figures. US crude inventories rose by a much larger than forecast 9.4m barrels last week, more than three times higher than expected. Refineries cut output and imports jumped, adding to the crude stocks. But gasoline stocks fell by 4.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 1.5m decline. And crude stocks at the Cushing delivery hub in Oklahoma dropped by 1.26m barrels, the first fall in seven weeks. The news has helped send Brent crude down 2.5% to $40.73 a barrel. Over in the US , and new home sales rose 2% in February after a 7% fall in the previous month. But this was lower than the expected 3% rise, and sales fell in three of the main regions, with only the West seeing an increase, which took some of the gloss off the figures. February sales rose to an annual rate of 512,000 compared to 502,000 in the previous month. The January figure was revised upwards from 494,000. On Wall Street, markets have taken the data in their stride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just 20 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the opinion poll that is hitting sterling: The polling was taken last week, on 16 March. Sterling has just hit its lowest level against a basket of other currencies in more than two years. Thats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Reuters, who are citing data from the Bank of England. Back to the other story of the morning... worries about the UK EU referendum. The pound is continuing to drop today, now down almost one cent against the US dollar at $1.4113. This latest weakness is triggered by a new telephone poll from Comres, just released, which shows the Remain campaign with 48% of support, and Leave on 41%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the narrowest lead since the general election of May 2015, according to Reuters. That follows the spike in sterling volatility we covered this morning, driven by new worries about Brexit. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the UK courts today Tom Hayes, the only person jailed in the UK for conspiring to rig the Libor rate, has been ordered to pay $1.25m, or \u00c2\u00a3878k, after a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproceeds of crime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hearing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that Hayes, and wife Sarah, will now be forced to sell their house in Surrey. Over at Westminster magistrates court, the alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flash crash trader\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Navinder Singh Sarao has been told he can be extradited to the US. Sarao is accused of causing market turmoil on Wall Street in 2010, which briefly wiped 1,000 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. From court, Rob Davies has the details: District judge Quentin Purdy at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday ruled that Sarao\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged actions constituted a crime in the UK. The ruling means Sarao, 37, can be sent to the US to answer 22 counts of wire fraud, commodities fraud and market manipulation carrying a maximum sentence of 380 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 imprisonment. Sarao\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer Richard Egan said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very disappointed. We definitely will be appealing. We think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a strong argument.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Energy and climate change committee member James Heappey shares our view of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing: Good news for fans of British Home Stores. The UK retailer has been rescued from closure, after its creditors voted in favour of the department store chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survival plan. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the details: Landlords, suppliers and other creditors approved the 88-year-old retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure, at a vital meeting in a hotel in west London on Wednesday. The approval of the CVA secures the short-term future of BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10,000 staff and 164 stores. However, the company still needs to restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00c2\u00a3571m and is likely to enter the Pension Protection Fund, and raise \u00c2\u00a3100m so it can continue trading and fund a turnaround plan that includes modernising its shops and product range. The CVA involves landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 164 shops. As many as 40 of these shops could close in the next few months if a deal on the size of the rent reduction cannot be reached with property owners. Greenpeace chief scientist Doug Parr, who pointed to flaws in the Hinkley C project this morning, has issued a statement heavily criticising the situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This morning the committee began to come to terms with the fact that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy policy has been annexed by EDF. It became very clear that Hinkley is dependant on the French state and the enthusiasm of the French and Chinese nuclear industries. This has distorted our national infrastructure planning, and has led to the UK government undermining our nascent but booming renewable energy businesses and scaring off investment. It is unconscionable that in reality the decisions pending about the future of our energy system and whether the UK meet our future carbon targets are in the hands of the French Economy Minister.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What have we just learned about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest nuclear power project in decades? 1) EDF are still committed. Despite the shock resignation of its CFO, and concerns over its own finances, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy company is still planning to build Britain a new nuclear power station at Hinkley. CEO Vincent de Rivaz insists that the controversial project is a good deal for all sides, and can be delivered. In a prepared statement, he said: I will start by saying, clearly and categorically, that Hinkley Point C will go ahead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for the UK. It has been a long road. The project has successfully passed a huge number of regulatory, commercial and operational milestones. EDF has already invested \u00c2\u00a32.4bn, and is spending another \u00c2\u00a355m per month. 2) But the project is in the French government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands, rather than MPs in Westminster. De Rivaz consistently failed to commit to signing a final investment decision in May. Why? Because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting for French ministers to agree a bailout for the company. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, is effectively deciding whether Britain embarks on the Hinkley project. Conservative MP James Heappey summed the situation up, in this exchange. If the French government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to that recapitalisation [of EDF], you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t build us a power station because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not got the cash. 3) Confidence isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. The committee shone a light on the nuclear industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s black spots - plants are very difficult to build safely, and expensive to decommission afterwards. Committee chair Angus MacNeil pointed to other projects where executive confidence has been followed by problems on the ground. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled Flamanville nuclear project loomed over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, given the problems with its reactor vessel. De Rivaz insisted that lessons have been learned, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier to say than prove..... 4) The climax is looming. While uranium has a half-life of 4.468bn years, the Hinkley C drama could be intensifying in just a few weeks. If EDF doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign on the dotted line to build Hinkley in early May, then the whole future of the project will be in serious doubt. That would please many campaigners - such as the three experts who told MPs this morning that Hinkley is a bad deal and best abandoned. But I suspect it would prove career-limiting for de Rivaz. Our environment editor Damian Carrington sums up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing: The session ends with chairman Angus MacNeil saying the committee has heard EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence about Hinkley \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loud and clear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But they want to see action \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a final investment decision on Hinkley by early May. So it that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, and the Hinkley project isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the Queens speech on May 18, Vincent de Rivaz and colleagues could be hauled back to parliament to explain themselves. The committee turn to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Taishan nuclear power station, which is using similar technology as Hinkey C. Q: When will Taishan be up and running? China General Nuclear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zhu Minhong says it will definitely start operations in 2017. Q: So why is it moving so much faster than Hinkley? EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson says Taishan has benefitted from some of the lessons learned at France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Flamanville. The committee are concerned about problems at the Flamanville nuclear power plant in France - will they affect Hinkley? Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson, managing director for Nuclear New Build at EDF, says that engineers are already addressing concerns about Flamanville. Lessons can be learned for Hinkley. [Background: back in April, the French nuclear regulator discovered flawed steel in EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reactor in Flamanville] The Hinkley reactor pressure vessel is not made yet, so chances can be made if necessary, Cadoux-Hudson adds. Q: Has a power station similar to Hinkley C been build before? Cadoux-Hudson says not; Hinkley has taken lessons from Flamanville, and also from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fukushima. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Pennycook MP isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed with what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing this morning. He tells the energy chiefs that: If this power station was fuelled on confidence and passion it would be up and running, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. The committee ask Zhu Minhong of China General Nuclear, EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner in the project, when he expects Hinkley to be signed off. Zhu explains that CGN are happy to be involved in Hinkley, concluding that: We are confident to say that this project will go ahead. Angus MacNeil, the committee chairman, nails it: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the future of Hinkley Point C in the hands of the French government? De Rivaz says the project is in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good hands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (sparking some tittering in the committee room). He argues that the French government should be closely involved, as he is EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major shareholder. Conservative MP James Heappey moves in for the kill. Heappey tells Vincent de Rivaz that he knows why EDF can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a categorical pledge to make the final investment decision in early May. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the French government is set to decide in early May on whether to recapitalise EDF. Heappey says: If the French government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to that recapitalisation, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t build us a power station because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not got the cash. De Rivaz repeats that he is fully confidence that the project will go ahead. Heappey says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given that confidence, that EDF won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to make the final investment decision in early May. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense to anyone, he adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story about the possible recapitalisation of EDF: The committee are concerned about the cost of (eventually) decommissioning Hinkley Point C. Is enough money being put aside? De Rivaz says this cost is fully recognised in the contract -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an example of us and the UK government behaving in a responsible way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But MPs point out that the cost of cleaning up previous projects, such as Windscale/Sellafield has been massively higher than expected. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in as different world today, De Rivaz insists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What has been done badly in the past will not be done badly again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: How much is Hinkley Point C actually going to cost? EDF say \u00c2\u00a318bn, but other estimates say \u00c2\u00a324.5bn De Rivaz says the construction cost is \u00c2\u00a318bn. The larger figure comes from the European Union, and relates to another way by which the project could have been financed. Q: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us more about the discussions with the French government about new financial support for EDF. Can you assure us that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be passed onto UK taxpayers in some way? De Rivaz says various options are being discussed, including: raising more capital, paying dividends in shares rather than cash selling non-core assets. None of them would impact the UK taxpayer, he promises. Q: Did EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief finance officer resign over the Hinkley project? De Rivaz declines to comment on the reasons for Thomas Piquemal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock resignation in early March. But he insists that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top executives support the project. Q: Your shares fell 6% when your CFO resigned; won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the impact be terrible if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the early May deadline? The project will go ahead, de Rivaz insists. De Rivaz insists that EDF is being responsible by sorting out its finances before making the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinal investment decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Hinkley. MPs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too impressed, though. The energy and climate change committee want to know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holding EDF back from a final decision on the Hinkley project. De Rivaz points says the fall in the oil price has put added strain on its finances, so it is in talks with the French government (its major shareholder) to finding a solution to these challenges. We are a great company, 70 years old, finding ways to tackle these challenges he continues. Q: Given EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence, when will it actually take the final investment decision to build Hinkley? It will be taken very soon, insists CEO Vincent de Rivaz. Q: When exactly? The French minister of economy and finance, Mr Macron, said early May. Q: If there is no decision by 15th May, the UK government and public should be worried? No-one should be worried about our commitment to a project in which we have spent more than \u00c2\u00a32bn. Q: So, which day? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give a precise day, de Rivaz insists... We cannot be more commited and more confident than we are. But the committee remain unconvinced -- they want a firmer commitment, and are going to ink in 15 May are their own deadline. The committee question Vincent de Rivaz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Hinkley Point C is a good deal for the British public. Q: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard that Hinkley is only economically fair if oil was $230 per barrel [it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $40 today], so how can it be fair to customers? De Rivaz replies that the project is seen as too financially risky in France, and too expensive in the UK, so on balance it is probably fair. Greenpeace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Doug Parr (who testified earlier) isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced. The EDF CEO also points out that his company are taking the risks to build the plant. UK consumers will pay nothing until electricity is produced in 2025, he adds. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has declared that the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant will proceed, despite concerns about the project. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading a statement to the energy and climate change committee now, which begins I will start by saying, clearly and catagorically, that Hinkley Point C will go ahead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for the UK. It has been a long road. The project has successfully passed a huge number of regulatory, commercial and operational milestones. De Rivas says EDF has the expertise needed, and a team and supply chain set up to build Hinkley C \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on time and on budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says that EDF is confident that the project will deliver the highest standards of safety, and has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the strong support of the UK and French governments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. De Rivas also touches on those concerns about the price of the project, saying: We are confident and proud to be able to deliver this project, as it meets the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need for reliable, affordable, low-carbon electricity. It is a fair deal - fair for customers, fair for investors. A group of energy experts have told UK Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy and climate change committee today that the Hinkley Point C nuclear project is very bad value for money, and should be scrapped. The future of the new nuclear power plant was thrown into doubt last month when the finance chief of EDF, the state-controlled French energy company, resigned. And Simon Taylor, lecturer in finance at Cambridge University, said, the best hope for most people concerned is that the French government decides to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pull the plug\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the deal. It would preserve the rest of the nuclear options in the UK, as it would not cast any doubt on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying commitment But if the UK cancels the project it could jeapodise all the other projects in the pipeline. Douglas Parr of Greenpeace told MPs that such a project could only be built by a huge slab of public money, and political will. Parr also heavily criticised the project, arguing that the cost of solar power and energy storage will both fall drastically in the next couple of decades, meaning Britain will be overpaying for Hinkley. Peter Atherton of investment bank Jefferies predicted that Hinkley should prove highly profitable to EDF, thanks to the contract agreed with the UK government. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a great, great deal, if they can build it on time and on budget.....Once it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operational, that power station is going to be gold. The committee will hear from EDF shortly.... The chairman of Lloyds of London has warned that Brexit would hurt its business. John Nelson told Reuters this morning that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153About 90 percent of our capital and business comes from outside the UK,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would diminish our attraction as a market to invest in if we were not part of the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyds is already finding conditions tougher - it posted a 30% drop in pre-tax profits this morning, partly due to record low interest rates cutting returns on its assets. Sports Direct has confirmed to the City this morning that its profits this year will be at the bottom end of the guidance issued in January. The announcement came a day after The Times published an interview with founder Mike Ashley, in which he warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the same profit we made last year....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That sent SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down 12% at one stage yesterday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down another 2% today. Boris Johnson, mayor of London, has begun testifying to the UK Treasury committee about the Eu referendum question. Boris, who supports Brexit, is fielding questions about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the economic and financial costs and benefits of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU membership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begun by arguing that the City would not suffer if Britain left the EU. Our politics liveblogger, Andy Sparrow, says Boris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance is his toughest test yet, in the undeclared contest to succeed David Cameron as PM. Andy is tracking the action in his liveblog. Over in the City, shares in bookmaker William Hill have slumped by 13% after it warned that online profits are below forecasts. The company blamed unlucky results at Cheltenham last week - where it lost money every day. Good news for the punters. William Hill also admits that new rules allowing online gamblers to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-exclude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 themselves from its services are hitting revenues, and could knock \u00c2\u00a320m off profits. That suggests recent moves to help those with gambling problems are working. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another great chart from Jamie McGeever of Reuters, showing how demand for protection against a sterling crisis has soared: Several economists have predicted that the pound would slump against the US dollar if the Brexit campaign win, from $1.41 today to perhaps $1.2 or lower. Brexit concerns will be high on the agenda at the Bank of England today. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with protecting financial stability, is holding its final meeting before the referendum. And the prospect of Britain voting to leaving the EU will be top of the agenda. Two weeks ago, governor Mark Carney told MPs that Brexit was the single biggest domestic risk to economic stability, so officials should be drawing up contingency plans to handle a Leave vote. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, told Bloomberg that the Bank of England will be worried about the impact on the City. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without a doubt, Brexit is the top of everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda until June, and possibly after if we do vote to leave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate is the financial system, so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking at whether banks will be able to continue to do their business if there is a vote to leave. They may also talk about other risks to the financial sector, whether there would be an exodus of firms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City traders may also be reacting to the latest Referendum opinion poll, from ICM. It showed that the Leave campaign are leading by 43% to 41%, with 16% still undecided. The cost of insuring against a sharp fall in the pound is soaring this morning, in another sign of Brexit jitteriness. Three-month sterling volatility (which tracks contracts that protect against wild moves in the pound) has hit levels not seen since the last general election. That shows that investors are expecting a serious shake-up over the next quarter. Reuters has snapped the details: STERLING/DOLLAR THREE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 14.50 PCT, HIGHEST SINCE MID-2010 EURO/STERLING THREE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY ALSO JUMPS TO 13.70 PERCENT, HIGHEST SINCE APRIL 2009 In a sense, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a surprise that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening now - the referendum falls in exactly three month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. But it also shows considerable uncertainty over the result, which could easily feed through to other parts of the economy. The pound is losing ground this morning, as concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming EU referendum swirl through the City. Serling has extended yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, and is down almost a half a cent since trading began in London, to $1.4168 against the US dollar. That wipes out most of its recent recovery, and sends it towards the six-year lows seen last month. Traders are citing the uncertainty over the June 23 referendum, and the possibility that the public could vote to break away from the EU. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrorist atrocities in Brussels could also be adding to Brexit concerns. But as Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale points out, there are other reasons to be bearish about sterling too. We are now exactly three months away from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on EU membership and some \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protagonists have chosen to use the atrocities in Brussels as a campaigning tool. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign is based solely on warnings of how dreadful leaving would be, so the whole debate is thoroughly depressing. Meanwhile, slowing growth is hurting public finances, the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending cuts are in a mess and so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wonder the pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flavour of the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pre-Easter feeling in the City this morning, as traders start to wind down for the long weekend. The market volatility of January and February is but a memory, as investors hunker down and ponder the state of the global economy. From Melbourne, IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Weston sums it up: What we are seeing at present is about as dull as one will see. As detailed yesterday, it could be the shortened week, but it feels like market players have entered the saloon and tumbleweeds are rolling down the street. So European markets are likely to be eerily calm. The economic calendar is disappointingly threadbare this morning too, although we do get the latest US oil reserves count this afternoon. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of corporate news around this morning. Lloyds of London, retail chains Kingfisher and Game Digital, bookmaker William Hill, and furnishings group Laura Ashley are all issuing results. That might shake things up in the Square Mile. And Swiss bank Credit Suisse has already announced 2,000 job cuts, as part of a restructuring plan: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the main events (such as we can find) through the day.....",

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the detail of the rig count: The fall in oil rigs to 372 is the lowest level since 2009, while the overall count of 464 for oil and natural gas rigs together dropped for the 14th week in a row to the lowest since at least 1940, according to Reuters. But analysts expect the rig count to bottom out in a few months and then recover later in the year. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back after the Easter break. Oil prices have pared their losses after the latest US rig count showed a fall last week. The number of oil rigs dropped by 15 to 372, after a rise of 1 the previous week. Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $40.14 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $39.22. It was a downbeat end to the shortened trading week for investors. The main damage was done by commodity companies, with metal prices hit by the stronger dollar (up on the back of hawkish comments on interest hikes by various US Federal Reserve members) and oil lower after US stocks rose on Thursday. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was also hit by the disappointing outlook statement from Next, which lost 15% of its value and helped send fellow clothing retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark-owner Associated British Foods lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 1.49% or 92.63 points at 6106.48 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.71% to 9851.35 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 2.13% lower at 4329.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.61% to 18,165.84 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.54% lower at 8789.8 But in Greece, the Athens market ended up 1.04% at 557.04 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 80 points or 0.47% lower. As markets remain in negative territory heading towards the close, next week could see further falls, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The shortened week is ending on a downbeat note, as markets look to register their first serious losses since mid-February. Even now, the move lower doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really put much of a dent in a remarkable rally off the lows of last month, but if US dollar strength and oil weakness continues, the final week of March could see the downside case accelerate. So far this week markets have been unable to make upward progress, and with Fed commentary becoming progressively more hawkish the coming slew of US data, including the vital non-farm payrolls report, could be the factor that determines whether the rally blossoms into April or withers on the vine The traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstronger dollar, weaker commodities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade is back in action in London today, plus a downgrade of the overall sector by Goldman Sachs is doing little for bullish sentiment. Any rally in miners in April is contingent on Chinese stimulus remaining a valid narrative, and right now the market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that will be the case. The pound has steadied, after its earlier falls on growing fears about the repercussions if Britain votes to leave the EU in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. It fell to its weakest level for two years on a trade weighted basis, but has recovered to trade at $1.4145 and 78.87p a euro, marginally up on the day. The recovery has been helped by the 11% lead for the Remain camp in the latest Brexit poll, as well as the weak US figures denting talk of an imminent rate rise and putting pressure on the dollar. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the poor US durable goods figures: Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After impressive results in January, US durable goods orders have slumped, reflecting a manufacturing sector still in recovery. Fed Chair Janet Yellen wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been expecting another large gain by the sector, but the fall of nearly three per cent will be of a concern to some observers. Many will see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results as just a small bump in the road to recovery, and with retail sales and inflation data coming in better than expected this month, they may well be right. Over on Wall Street, shares are down in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 82 points to 17,420. More gloomy news. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies are suffering from the weakest growth in new orders since the depths of the financial crisis. Data firm Markit reports that activity across the sector has only risen slightly this month, after being hit by bad weather in February. Firms also reported that new orders almost stalled, which is the weakest reading since October 2009. They blamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less favourable economic backdrop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which made some clients too nervous to launch new projects. The overall Service sector PMI crept up to 51.0 in March, up from 49.7 in February, which suggests modest growth this month. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy is going through its worst growth spell for three and a half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of a strong rebound in service sector activity in March is a big disappointment, as bad weather had been blamed for part of the weakness in the first two months of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Combined with the lacklustre performance seen in manufacturing, the subdued services survey points to the weakest quarterly expansion of the economy since the third quarter of 2012. The PMI surveys suggest the economy grew at a worryingly meagre 0.7% annualised rate in the first quarter. Williamson also fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst may be to come\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... City traders have a new Brexit poll to digest, showing that the campaign to stay in the European Union has a smaller lead. According to Survation, the Remain side have 46% support, with Leave on 35%, and 19% of the population still making up their mind. That 11% gap is smaller than last month, as the WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Bird points out: Wall Street is expected to follow Europe and Asia lower, when trading begins in a few minutes: The European stock selloff is accelerating, sending the FTSE 100 down 106 points or 1.7% to 6092. Only a handful of share are up in London, while the mining sector continues to lead the market down. And retailer Next is on track for its biggest one-day loss in 17 years, after warning about tough conditions this morning. A flurry of US economic data is heading our way. First up, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen by 6,000, to 265,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slightly smaller drop than expected, and the 55th week in a row that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been below the 300,000 mark. Separately, orders for durable goods at US factories have fallen by 2.8% in February. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data has been revised down too, from a 4.7% increase to 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the third fall in four months, suggesting American manufacturers are experiencing softer demand. The CBI business group has issued its own healthcheck on the UK retail sector, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomier than the Office for National Statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report [see here]. According to the CBI, 31% of retailers reported rising sales this month, while 24% said they were down. That gives a net balance of +7, down from +10 in February and 16% in January. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern: European stock markets are stumbling towards the Easter long weekend. All the main bourses are in the red, with the FTSE 100 shedding 85 points or 1.4% to 6114 points. In London, Next has plunged by 12% after warning that 2016 will be a hard year. It is followed by a string of mining companies, suffering from weakening commodity prices as the US dollar rises. Investor are worried that a new bout of turbulence could be approaching, as we enter the second quarter of the financial year next week. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, chief global economist at stock brokers Charles Stanley, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sense of crisis has dissipated but has not completely evaporated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a new report, he cautions: Despite the apparently benign outlook for the global economy, risks to that view remain notably elevated. Many (including Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Societe General amongst them) are all urging investors to lock in recent gains. The cost of protecting against a plunge in the value of the pound has hit new six-year highs this morning, as Brexit fears continue to stalk the City. Reuters has snapped the details: THREE-MONTH STERLING/DOLLAR IMPLIED VOLATILITY HITS 15 PERCENT FOR FIRST TIME IN ALMOST SIX YEARS THREE-MONTH EURO/STERLING IMPLIED VOLATILITY ALSO HITS SEVEN-YEAR HIGH OF 13.8 PERCENT UK chancellor George Osborne is testifying to the Treasury committee right now, about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget (and the political fallout it has triggered, I suspect). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here Our Politics Live blog is covering it: A majority of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bankers believe they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be better off if Britain stays in the European Union. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey from the British Bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association, which includes all the major banks. It found that: 60% of BBA members predict Brexit would have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 26% believe the impact would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BBA chief executive Anthony Browne said the surveys disproved suggestions that the City could welcome a victory for the Leave campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our survey shows there is almost no appetite from banks for the UK to leave the EU... However, as the majority of our members have not expressed a position on the matter of UK membership, the BBA will adopt a neutral position in the referendum debate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest UK retail sales figure are out....and they show that demand for new clothes has taken a dive. Spending on textiles, clothes and footwear fell by 2.8% year-on-year in February, with consumers buying 2.4% less stuff than before (because of price deflation). This was the only sub-sector not to achieve higher spending year-on-year, the Office for National Statistics says. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing stores appear to have endured an unlucky run of weather. It was unusually warm in the run-up to Christmas, cutting demand for winter coats. And the wet weather in early 2016 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped, as consumers have been put off from buying spring clothes. According to the ONS, clothing sales are down 3.4% in the last three months - the biggest quarterly fall since December 1990. This rather backs up Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about how tough this year will be. Overall retail sales spending fell by 0.7% in February, a smaller drop than expected after the January sales surge. On an annual basis, total retail spending was 1.4% higher than a year ago. The European Central Bank has warned that the global economic recovery has weakened, meaning 2016 will be challenging - particularly in emerging markets. In its latest economic bulletin the ECB says: Global activity moderated at the turn of the year, and is expected to continue expanding at a modest pace. Low interest rates, improving labour markets and rising confidence support the outlook for advanced economies. By contrast, the medium-term outlook for emerging market economies remains more uncertain. Economic activity in China is expected to continue decelerating, with negative spillovers to other emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, while commodity exporting countries need to adjust further to lower commodity prices. The ECB also points out that global trade seems to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost momentum again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the turn of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a worrying sign. Earnings growth in the eurozone is another concern: The full report is online here The pound is coming under fresh pressure this morning. Sterling has dropped to a 15-month low against the euro, down 0.3% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2584. That means one euro is worth 79.40p. Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning may have heightened concerns over the UK economy, especially with the uncertainty of the EU referendum ahead. Brexit fears have already driven traders to protect themselves against a sterling crisis, as this chart shows: UK engineering firm Renishaw has also disappointed the City this morning by slashing its profit forecasts. Renishaw, which specialises in precision engineering for jet engines, wind turbines and medical equipment, warned that it has suffered a fall in orders from Asian customers. It says: Revenue last year benefited from a number of large orders in the Far East which have not been repeated to the same extent this year, and we have now received information that indicates we are unlikely to achieve the trading levels previously anticipated at the time of our half year results announcement in January 2016. That has heightened concerns over the global economy, and sent Renishaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares sliding 12%. After a delayed start, shares in Next have plunged by over 10% after the retailer warned that trading conditions are the toughest he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In a strikingly gloomy statement, chairman Lord Wolfson told shareholders that the coming year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may well be the toughest we have faced since 2008\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He cautioned: It looks as though we may be set for a challenging year, with economic and cyclical factors potentially working against us. It may well feel like walking up the down escalator, with a great deal of effort required to stand still. Next also cut its sales forecasts, warning that they could fall by 1% at worst, or grow by 4% at best. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sharp downgrade on its last statement, in January, when it predicted sales growth of between 1% and 6%. That has sent investors racing to sell Next shares, sending them tumbling by 690p to \u00c2\u00a359.90p. European stock markets are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 60 points, dragged down by mining stocks. Glencore, Anglo American and Rio Tinto are all being thumped by the impact of the higher US dollar on their profitability, given the slump in iron ore and oil prices this week. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Global markets are moving into the Easter holiday long weekend on a more cautious note.... as a stronger US dollar following some hawkish Fed commentary weighs on the commodities space. Iron ore is also being hammered this morning. Concerns over global growth, allied with the stronger US dollar, wiped almost 6% off the price of a ton of iron ore in Singapore trading. Bloomberg has the details: The SGX AsiaClear contract for May settlement sank as much as 5.8 percent to $49.90 a ton in Singapore.... Iron ore has been on a wild ride in March as investors sought to gauge conflicting economic signals from China against still-elevated port stockpiles and shifts in the U.S. currency. Asian stock markets have hit a one-week low, as those worries over the stronger US dollar rippled through Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul and Hong Kong. The Chinese stock market led the selloff, down 1.7%, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng close behind. The sight of falling commodity prices alarmed investors, despite an optimistic speech from the Chinese premier, who claimed that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains strong. And Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei dropped by 0.6%, even though a weaker yen should be good for Japanese exporters. Angus Nicholson of IG says the markets simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy by the recent dollar rally: The oil price and equity markets are teetering on the verge of a much larger pullback as hawkish Fed officials have lifted the US dollar this week. Markets in Asia look to be rolling over as the whole region suffered steady losses throughout the session. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat speech at the Bo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ao Forum did little to soothe investor concerns as the Shanghai Composite had its worst day in two weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last day before the Easter break, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much springtime cheer in the City of London this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chilly and cloudy (with rain on the way) but mainly because the financial world is getting fretful again, mainly about the US dollar. The dollar has strengthened in recent days, pushing commodity prices down and giving emerging markets fresh reasons to worry about capital flight. This move is being driven by hints from US central bankers that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more aggressively than the markets expect, to keep inflationary pressures in check. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s curious, given the Fed sounded so dovish at last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to worry traders, as a stronger dollar will not be good for global economic growth. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: A succession of Federal Reserve policymakers have come out in recent days suggesting a rate rise in April is a real possibility, which rather begs the question as to why there was so little dissent over the decision itself last week. Granted, the majority of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speakers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got a vote on the committee this year but the level of hawkishness does jar somewhat with last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish message, and could present problems for Janet Yellen if the economic data shows significant signs of improvement between now and the end of April. The change of tone also undermines the credibility and consistency of the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to the markets at a time when sentiment still remains fragile and emerging markets remain vulnerable to the strength of the greenback. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the main European markets are expected to fall this morning: In the corporate world, retailer Next is reporting results right now, and warning that 2016 looks pretty challenging (more on that shortly). And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a splurge of economic data, as statistics bodies clear the decks before Good Friday. Highlights include: 9am GMT: The European Central Bank Publishes its economic bulletin 9.30am GMT: UK retail sales figures for February 12.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless claims (for last week) 12.30pm GMT: US durable goods orders for February 5pm GMT: The Baker Hughes US rig count We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day, and resisting cracking open the chocolate eggs....",

There is a consensus that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Yellen also points to the recent fall in the commodity prices -and cautions against assuming it is unalloyed good news for Americans.</strong> </p> <p>Instead, the world economy could suffer if oil producing nations slash spending or sack workers.</p> <p>The Fed chief says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms. In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail significant financial strains and increased layoffs. In the event oil prices were to fall again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full speech is online here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/boes_/status/714849785824604160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yellen dovish, like two weeks ago: highlights concerns over global growth and inflation expectations <a href=\"https://t.co/7mrAQ6Z8Gv\">https://t.co/7mrAQ6Z8Gv</a></p>&mdash; Matthew B (@boes_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boes_/status/714849785824604160\">March 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56faac40e4b0db49e2ff367f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-29T16:29:42.173Z\">5.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen: Fed must be cautious about rate hikes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking to the Economic Club of New York right now.</strong></p> <p>And Yellen is dropping a hint that US interest rates are likely to only rise modestly in the months and years ahead.</p> <p>She argues that the Federal Open Market Committee [FOMC] which sets interest rates can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk tightening monetary policy too fast, as it could be difficult to row back.</p> <p>On the other hand, going too slowly is less risky as the FOMC could simply accelerate the tightening.</p> <p>Or in Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider it appropriate for the Committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because, with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric.</p> <p> If economic conditions were to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech...and some more hawkish comments from other Federal Reserve policymakers: Goodnight! GW The odds of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates this summer have just fallen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest market data from Wall Street: Echoing the Bank of England this morning, Janet Yellen also warns that the economic outlook has deteriorated recently. Fed chair Janet Yellen is also warning that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy is a potential threat to the global economy. She says: One concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly influenced by developments in China. There is a consensus that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate policy. Yellen also points to the recent fall in the commodity prices -and cautions against assuming it is unalloyed good news for Americans. Instead, the world economy could suffer if oil producing nations slash spending or sack workers. The Fed chief says: For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms. In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail significant financial strains and increased layoffs. In the event oil prices were to fall again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy. The full speech is online here: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking to the Economic Club of New York right now. And Yellen is dropping a hint that US interest rates are likely to only rise modestly in the months and years ahead. She argues that the Federal Open Market Committee [FOMC] which sets interest rates can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk tightening monetary policy too fast, as it could be difficult to row back. On the other hand, going too slowly is less risky as the FOMC could simply accelerate the tightening. Or in Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words: I consider it appropriate for the Committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because, with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric. If economic conditions were to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy. By contrast, if the expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero. And that has sent shares jumping on Wall Street, as investors hail the idea of more low borrowing costs and cheap money. After a choppy day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, the FTSE 100 finished the session almost exactly where it started. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index has closed down half a point, at 6105.90. Retailers led the risers, with Marks &amp; Spencer and Associated British Foods both gaining 3%. But that was cancelled out by falling mining stocks; commodity trader Glencore lost almost 5%, followed by Anglo American (-4.3%), and Rio Tinto (-3.8%). They were hit by the impact of the stronger US dollar, which pushes down commodity prices. The markets had begun the day in decent enough spirits after Easter. But the mood darkened - rather like the weather - after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest warnings on the EU referendum and global risks. Trustnet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tony Cross fears more volatility ahead: The shadow of Brexit looms large over financial markets with investors, companies and the government unable to make cast iron decisions until the result is known. Much like the Scottish referendum this one looks set to go down to the wire, so expect market volatility to be heightened as we close in on the vote. Over in America, consumer confidence has jumped unexpectedly. The monthly Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 96.2 in March, beating forecasts of a small rise to 94. Those interviewed said they were more optimistic about short-term prospects, which suggests the recent stock market recovery may have fed through. Mark Carney has been trying his best to avoid being dragged into the EU referendum issue. When he testified to MPs three weeks ago, the BoE governor argued that Brexit was more than a financial issue, and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give any forecasts about growth or employment after the vote. But despite that, the Bank is clearly concerned about the EU referendum, in under three months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that policymakers anticipate serious ructions if the public vote to leave the EU, and are taking precautions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main points. The Bank of England has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system looks less secure than three months ago. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy, the flow of capital out of emerging economies, and the recent fall in asset prices all show rising instability. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee singled out the Brexit referendum as the biggest threat to domestic stability. They warned that if Britain votes to leave the EU, the pound would tumble, banks would tighten lending, and the UK could struggle to finance its current account deficit. Campaigners to remain in the EU urged the public to take the warning seriously. But Brexit supporters argue that the UK economy would have brighter prospects outside Europe. The BoE has also taken action against buy-to-let landlords. It is forcing lenders to apply tougher affordability checks, to ensure borrowers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over-extending themselves. One leading estate agent reckons the move is overkill. Landlords already face higher stamp duty costs from April, and some may struggle to cope with this new clampdown. In other news.... City investors are waiting to hear from Janet Yellen. The head of the US Federal Reserve is giving a speech in New York, in a few hours time (from 4.30pm BST) Workers at Port Talbot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel workers are poised to learn whether India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tata will support a rescue plan. In the eurozone, new data has shown that bank lending has picked up. It still remains historically weak, though. After a bright start, European stock markets have now lost their early gains. And the oil price has continued to slide. Brent crude is down almost 3% at $39.18 a barrel, dragged down by pessimism that oil producers will ever agree production cuts. Campaigners to leave the EU are (understandably) less alarmed by the Financial Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, argues that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be more, not less, secure out of the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe biggest risk to the UK economy, a risk that even the Bank of England acknowledges, is Britain remaining in a declining political union where we are outvoted and our trade is held back. Even pro-EU campaigners have admitted that after we Vote Leave on June 23rd we will secure a deal where the economy will grow and jobs will be created. The safest thing for our economic security is to spend our money on our priorities.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Campaigners to stay in the European Union are seizing on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Brexit is a threat to UK financial stability. And leading the way is Alistair Darling, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former Chancellor of the Exchequer. He says the Financial Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stark warning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should be taken very seriously. In a statement released by the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, Darling says: The independent assessment that uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe most significant near-term domestic risk to financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be a major worry for everyone whose job and income depends on the long-term health of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This assessment makes it clear our economy would be more vulnerable and less resilient if we vote to leave the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leading to higher mortgage rates for families and higher interest rates for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a report Leave campaigners can simply dismiss as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbiased\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcscaremongering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It is a serious piece of work that should make everyone think twice about irresponsibly gambling with people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs and livelihoods. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is clear from this report that Britain is stronger, safer and better off remaining a member of the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Darling was Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister during the financial crisis, when he handled the bailouts of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new clampdown on buy-to-let lending. Leaf, a former chairman of the RICS trade body, argues that recent measures announced by the UK government will cool the market. The BoE should have waited to see the effect, rather than deciding to force lenders to enforce tougher affordability checks, he argues: The changes the Chancellor has made to mortgage interest tax relief and higher stamp duty for landlords will have enough of an impact on buy-to-let without the need for further interference from the Bank of England. Landlords will already be put off investing further unless the numbers add up and this is a case of kicking them when they are down. Leaf also argues that rental costs could actually go up if BTL landlords quit the sector, as it would reduce availability. On the other hand, that could also allow more renters to move onto the housing ladder.... As we suspected, the Bank of England is keen to take the heat out of the buy-to-let mortgage market. The BoE will push small mortgage lenders to enforce higher standards, including tighter checks on landlords\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 income and the impact of new stamp duty rates on BTL mortgages. Under the plan, lenders must that that borrowers have enough funds to cover interest payments, even if borrowing costs went up to 5.5%. My colleague Sean Farrell is attending today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s briefing, and explains: On buy-to-let lending, the committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FPC remains alert to potential threats to financial stability from rapid growth in buy-to-let mortgage lending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The committee, chaired by the governor, Mark Carney, said it expected measures announced by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulatory Authority, to dampen the market. The buy-to-let property market has leapt back into life over the past three years after slumping during the financial crisis. Last year, gross lending for buy-to-let property jumped to about \u00c2\u00a337bn, up from less than \u00c2\u00a310bn in 2009 and approaching the peak of almost \u00c2\u00a345bn in 2007. More here: Bank of England clamps down on buy-to-let lending Augustin Eden, analyst at City firm Accendo Markets, sums up the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message: June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit referendum could both push up borrowing costs AND weaken Sterling, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee. Of course, the reason for a rise in borrowing costs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be an interest rate hike by the central bank, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be increased risk. Update: That Brexit opinion poll is closer than you might think..... Bang on cue, a new opinion poll has shown that European Union referendum battle has got tighter. A poll for the Evening Standard newspaper gives the Remain campaign an eight point lead, at 49% vs 41% to Leave. Last month, Remain was ahead by 54% to 36%, an 18% point advantage. The survey also found that many people believe prime minister David Cameron should resign if the public vote to leave the EU. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: Half of public say Cameron must quit if he loses EU poll UK government insiders are briefing that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit comments are an important contribution to the debate ahead of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. However, Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway reports that the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share this enthusiasm: So who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right? Well, governor Mark Carney did brief MPs about the EU referendum earlier this month, when he labelled Brexit the biggest single domestic risk to stability. He also suggested that some banks could leave the City in the event of a Brexit vote. However, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall Carney warning specifically that Brexit would make it harder to borrow. And anyway, this is the first time that the Financial Policy Committee has been so explicit about its concerns. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally is fizzling out, in the face of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy prognosis. The FTSE 100 is just 3 points higher (having jumped nearly 50 points at the start of trading). Britain could suffer a credit crunch if the public vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on June 23, the Bank of England claims. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122e Financial Policy Committee warns that uncertainty over Brexit has already hit the pound, and driven up the cost of insuring against a sterling crisis. It now fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any period of extended uncertainty following the vote could increase risks to financial stability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, the FPC says: Looking ahead, heightened and prolonged uncertainty has the potential to increase the risk premia investors require on a wider range of UK assets, which could lead to a further depreciation of sterling and affect the cost and availability of financing for a broad range of UK borrowers. BoE policymakers also fear that Britain could struggle to support its current account deficit if investors shun UK assets. It says: The financing of that deficit is reliant on continuing material inflows of portfolio and foreign direct investment. Those flows have contributed to the financing of the public sector financial deficit and corporate investment, including in commercial real estate. Heightened uncertainty could test the capacity of core funding markets at a time when the liquidity of these markets has shown signs of fragility across advanced economies. And to complete the gloomy Brexit picture, the BoE also predicts that the eurozone would suffer too: The impact of a decision of the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union could spill over to the euro area, driving up risk premia and further diminishing the prospects for growth there. Newsflash: The Bank of England is warning that the outlook for financial stability in the United Kingdom has deteriorated over the last four months. In a new report, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee cites the slowdown in the Chinese economy, weaker growth across the globe, and recent market turbulence. It also singles out the upcoming EU referendum as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most significant near-term domestic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the UK. The FPC says: Some pre-existing risks have crystallised, drawing on the resilience of the system. Other risks stemming from the global environment have increased. Domestic risks have been supplemented by risks around the EU referendum. In a subdued report, the FPC flags up that emerging market economies have suffered capital outflows, following last December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hike in US interest rates. There have also been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread falls in the prices of risky assets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And it also cites concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and the recent heavy falls in bank share prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: In an environment of low inflation and continued weakness in investment and productivity growth, prospects for global nominal growth are subdued. This raises questions about resilience to future adverse shocks, particularly for emerging market economies where debt levels continue to rise and terms of trade have deteriorated. In this environment, the re-acceleration of credit growth in China is concerning. In some advanced economies, lower nominal interest rates associated with weak growth prospects are restraining profitability in banking systems that are still in post-crisis repair and pose challenges for some banking business models. Globally, bank equity prices have fallen significantly and a material proportion of banks are now trading below book value. More to follow.... Anticipation is building in the City, ahead of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech today (at around 4.30pm BST). Yellen is due to deliver a speech called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Economic Club of New York luncheon. In traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 heads, that speech is subtitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some hints about might the Fed raise interest rates again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says: The dollar has started to recover at least some of the ground it has lost in the last week. Investors now await Federal Reserve Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech this afternoon for more news on the possibilities of future US interest hikes. Natural resource stocks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sharing in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Instead, mining stocks are leading the fallers in London, as a stronger US dollar hits commodity prices. Anglo American is leading the way, down 4%, amid concern that the recent recovery in the copper price is faltering. Brenda Kelly, chief analyst at London Capital Group, says: UK miners are enjoying their usual habitat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c back in the red.... Weaker growth in developed markets and word that China is building inventories rather than utilising for construction coupled with the strong dollar would indicate that the 15% gain in copper since mid-January has been built on sand. More here: Equities higher ahead of Yellen Oversupply worries are dragging the oil steadily lower this morning. Brent crude is now down almost 2% at $39.53 per barrel, with analysts citing the regular concerns about weak demand and an oversupply glut. While Tata Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board decides the fate of Port Talbot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steelworkers, UK politicians have been bickering about whose fault it all is. Over to the Press Association: Business Minister Anna Soubry said the Government was prepared to consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all options\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ensure that steel production continued at the South Wales site. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are looking at all manner of options that may or may not be available to us as a Government, all options,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It starts from a base of making sure that we continue to make steel in Port Talbot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She suggested that Liberal Democrat former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable had not done enough to address the problems in the British steel industry during his time in office between 2010 and 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think Vince could have done more, yes. Sorry, but that is my view. We were in a coalition then,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I was appointed the Prime Minister specifically said to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe know we have some very real problems in our steel industry and I want you to devote a large amount of your time to solving those problems as much as you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her comments were dismissed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153utterly rubbish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Lib Dem leader Tim Farron who said Sir Vince had protected the Redcar plant, which has subsequently closed, and the wider steel industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Government has no plan and is failing them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Hold onto your hats, folks. We have some encouraging financial data from Europe. Bank lending to eurozone businesses rose by 0.9% in February, up from 0.6% in January. That indicates that companies are becoming more confident and looking to borrow to fund new plans. And bank loans to eurozone households rose by 1.6%, which is the fastest growth since 2011. That could be another sign of economic demand picking up, after years of weak activity. As this tweet shows, lending to consumers and firms hit a trough in 2014 as the single currency bloc slumped into deflation. Anna Stupnytska, economist at Fidelity, reckons the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stimulus package should continue to push lending higher this year: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are up across the board: Shares in oil exploration firm Rockhopper have slumped by 10% after a United Nations commission ruled that the Falklands Islands fall within Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s territorial waters. Rockhopper has been drilling around the Falklands for several years, and in January it announced it had discovered oil off the northern coast. But the Falklands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nascent oil industry could now be disrupted, after the UN said it agreed that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s territory extended up to 350 miles from the coast. That would include the Falklands. Associated Press has more details: The Argentine foreign ministry said its waters had increased by 1.7 million square km (0.66 million square miles) and the decision will be key in its dispute with Britain over the islands. Argentina lost a brief, bloody 1982 war with Britain after Argentinian troops seized the South Atlantic archipelago that Latin Americans call the Malvinas. The UN commission on the limits of the continental shelf sided with Argentina, ratifying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2009 report fixing the limit of its territory at 200 to 350 miles from its coast. The mood in the City right now: Over in Mumbai, British union leaders have made a last-ditch attempt to persuade steel giant Tata to keep supporting Wales Port Talbot plant. Community, the steel union, says the talks with Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen and constructive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They hope that Tata will back a \u00c2\u00a3100m rescue plan for the site, which is reportedly losing \u00c2\u00a31m per day. But workers fear that Tata will decide today to mothball the site, which is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest steelworks. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct suspects today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long. Following a slump on Thursday, which was induced by a strengthening dollar, falling commodities and a downbeat update from Next, this looks like an opportunistic bet by investors eager to make a quick buck and buy on the dips. Given the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tumultuous form it is hard to see this being sustained... European stock markets have opened higher this morning as traders return to their desks after the Easter break. The main indices have risen by at least 0.5% at the open, as traders ponder the strength of the recent rally since the turmoil of January and early February. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 47 points or 0.8% to 6154, in a fairly broad rally led by financial firms such as Barclays, Prudential and Standard Life. Investors have had a long weekend to chew over the state of the global economy, from the slowdown in China to the deflationary pressures in the eurozone. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hard to say whether 2016 will be a good year for shares, given recent weak economic data and geopolitical tensions. Philip Borkin, a senior economist in Auckland at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd, summed up the mood well in a note to clients: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is certainly not a global economic backdrop where one could say that a lot of clarity is on offer at present.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason for investors to be particularly positive right now: Over the last couple of weeks European markets have struggled to move meaningfully in either direction, contained by a stabilisation in commodity prices, slightly less concern about the Chinese economy, and commitments to slightly looser policy from the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Peoples Bank of China. And the oil market continues to be stalked by oversupply fears. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed the price of Brent crude oil down by almost 1% this morning, back below $40 per barrel. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nerve-wracking day for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry. Top executives at India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tata are meeting in Mumbai to decide whether to continue supporting its operation in Port Talbot. The Welsh factory has already suffered deep job cuts, in the face of slumping steel prices. Tata must now decide whether to invest more in the plant to ensure its future, or not. At 11am BST the Bank of England will announce the details of the stress tests which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks will face later this year. The BoE may also signal that it is ready to clamp down on buy-to-let property owners, when it publishes its review of the sector. Investors will also be watching for a speech by Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, at 4.30pm BST. She may drop some hints about the prospects of US interest rate rises in the coming months. Chris Weston of IG explains: The interest rate markets see a further hike in June as a 36% probability, so in theory, Ms Yellen only really needs to acknowledge the improvement in inflation forces and we could see the US dollar rally. The latest measure of US consumer confidence, due at 3pm BST, could also show whether America could stomach higher interest rates. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief executive, tried to reassure investors that the lower number of deliveries was not due to declining demand for planes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the announcement, coupled with a lower-than-expected profit outlook, sent Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tumbling on 27 January. Boeing is attempting to overhaul its sprawling commercial jetliner manufacturing arm as Muilenburg seeks to make his mark. Muilenburg, who took over last July, used cost cuts to shore up profits in a period of constrained defence spending when he ran Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence unit. The company is seeking savings beyond job cuts by renegotiating supplier contracts, consolidating spending programmes, slashing business travel and trying to boost productivity and reduce excess stocks. The total number of job cuts required will in part be dictated by the success of those initiatives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there is no employment reduction target, the more we can control costs as a whole the less impact there will be to employment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said.",
