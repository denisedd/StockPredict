This means that manufacturing is likely to be expanding at a slightly stronger pace than it was in January.</p> <p>But slightly stronger is still a long way from robust. Typically, we see an index of 50 or above as necessary to indicate growth at an acceptable rate, whilst 43.2 is the historical break-even index for contraction or expansion.</p> <p>One key element of this release, which always happens the same week as the US labour report, is the employment index. This also rose, reaching 48.5 from a very soft 45.9 in January. But like the headline index, it remains deep in \u201ccontraction\u201d territory, albeit marginally less so than in January.</p> <p>Moreover, as a guide to payrolls, this is not very reliable. Despite the weak January employment index, January manufacturing payrolls employment actually rose by 29,000, its highest since November 2014. On a more positive note, new orders remained positive at a respectable 51.5.</p> <p>Markets will no doubt see this survey as a positive release, an excuse for stocks to rally and bond yields to rise. But in truth, this is another mixed survey, and not terribly reliable at that. We do not see it as sufficiently robust to warrant the Federal Reserve raising rates again at its March meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d5b4cbe4b090d60ad09ca7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-01T15:27:18.911Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ericbeebo/status/704684708148420609\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And there we have it: ISM mfg reverts back closer to Markit.

The weakness led manufacturing to post job losses for the fifth time in the last seven months. On a brighter note, the weakness was not across the board as new orders for intermediate goods edged higher.</p> <p>Manufacturers face a challenging environment, with subdued demand from emerging markets and the ongoing weakness of the oil price weighing heavily on companies in the oil and gas supply chain. Against this backdrop, manufacturers will be looking at the forthcoming Budget and will want to see the Chancellor avoid adding significant costs at a time when business conditions are tough.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2> <strong>Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weak start to the year continues for the manufacturing sector with even domestic demand unable to contribute to the levels it has done previously.</p> <p>However, amidst the headwinds of slowing global growth, uncertainty over a Brexit and skills shortages in the industry comes the recent depreciation in sterling which may just provide the jump-start that manufacturing exporters need to boost exports and put a spark back into the sector\u2019s performance.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"241dd0e3156be60fec316f88b43a497f13860c99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241dd0e3156be60fec316f88b43a497f13860c99/0_0_539_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK factory PMI\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK factory PMI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markit/Berenberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank.</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Domestic demand has been the key driver of UK manufacturing in recent months.

                "bodyText":"The new month has got off to a positive start for stock markets, as investors shrugged off disappointing manufacturing PMI data from China to the UK to the US. Indeed, markets seemed to be more focus on the prospect of more central bank stimulus ahead to boost sluggish global economies or, in the case of the Federal Reserve, a delay in any planned interest rate rise. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: That\u2019s certainly been a solid start to the month\u2019s trade, with the FTSE-100 putting in another impressive day of gains although with downbeat PMI data out of China - and indeed the UK \u2013 it\u2019s difficult not to be left thinking that the upside has come about only at the expense of promised further stimulus measures. A strong performance from the oil price helped, with Brent crude currently up 1.2% to $37.04 a barrel. The final scores on the European markets were: The FTSE 100 finished 55.79 points or 0.92% higher at 6152.88, its highest leel since 31 December last year Germany\u2019s Dax was up 2.34% at 9717.16 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.22% to 4406.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.21% to 18,011.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.77% at 8611.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.65% to 520.08 On Wall Street, ahead of the Super Tuesday US delegate voting, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 300 points or 1.8% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Using the closing prices, also likely to be demoted from the FTSE 100 are Smiths Group, Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Aberdeen Asset Managment. The four replacements as things stand would be Paddy Power Betfair after its merger, hospitals group Mediclinic following a reverse takeover, Morrisons after it was relegated in December at the last review, and Investec. Again, the moves need to be ratified by the FTSE committee on Wednesday. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct International is being relegated from the FTSE 100 following a Guardian investigation. The demotion is based on tonight\u2019s closing price of 410p, down 40% since December, and will be confirmed officially by a committee at index compilers FTSE on Wednesday. Full story here: The Draghi comments come from a letter sent today in reply to MEP Jonas Fern\u00e1ndez. ECB president Mario Draghi has added fuel to the expectations that the central bank will unveil further stimulus measures at this month\u2019s meeting. He said the euro area inflation dynamics continued to be weaker than expected, and there are increased risks to the bank\u2019s earlier outlook, according to Reuters. The agency reports him saying \u201cthere are no limits to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments within our mandate to achieve our objective of inflation rates below,k but close to, 2% over the medium term.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy round-up of the day\u2019s PMIs: Not exactly a convincing recovery is the view of Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, on the ISM figures: The February Institute of Supply Management (ISM ) manufacturing index rose to 49.5 from 47.8 in January. This means that manufacturing is likely to be expanding at a slightly stronger pace than it was in January. But slightly stronger is still a long way from robust. Typically, we see an index of 50 or above as necessary to indicate growth at an acceptable rate, whilst 43.2 is the historical break-even index for contraction or expansion. One key element of this release, which always happens the same week as the US labour report, is the employment index. This also rose, reaching 48.5 from a very soft 45.9 in January. But like the headline index, it remains deep in \u201ccontraction\u201d territory, albeit marginally less so than in January. Moreover, as a guide to payrolls, this is not very reliable. Despite the weak January employment index, January manufacturing payrolls employment actually rose by 29,000, its highest since November 2014. On a more positive note, new orders remained positive at a respectable 51.5. Markets will no doubt see this survey as a positive release, an excuse for stocks to rally and bond yields to rise. But in truth, this is another mixed survey, and not terribly reliable at that. We do not see it as sufficiently robust to warrant the Federal Reserve raising rates again at its March meeting. Here are some of the respondents comments to the ISM: \u201cLow oil prices and reduced activity continue affecting our business.\u201d (Petroleum &amp; Coal Products) \u201cU.S. business demand is solid; international demand is soft.\u201d (Chemical Products) \u201cMobility spend is up.\u201d (Computer &amp; Electronic Products) \u201cBusiness has to get better. And it appears it is. Healthy backlog for 2016.\u201d (Fabricated Metal Products) \u201cVery strong demand for product. Material availability very good and commodity pricing continues to be depressed.\u201d (Machinery) \u201cAirlines are still ordering planes and spare parts for plane galleys.\u201d (Transportation Equipment) \u201cMarket is beginning to trend up with spring season on its way.\u201d (Wood Products) \u201cNot seeing impact from global economic volatility or oil prices. Business is strong and growth projections remain the same.\u201d (Miscellaneous Manufacturing) \u201cOrders are coming in stronger than expected.\u201d (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u201cStill a bit sluggish.\u201d (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) The Federal Reserve\u2019s dilemma: David Morrison at Spread Co said: The US ISM Manufacturing PMI beat the consensus expectation by quite a distance. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t enough to register expansion in a sector which has been declining for over a year now. Earlier today China\u2019s Manufacturing PMIs continued to show contraction in the sector. On top of that, there was an unwelcome dip in the country\u2019s Non-Manufacturing PMI as well, suggesting that the hoped-for rebalancing from manufacturing and exporting to consumer demand may not be going as well as hoped. Manufacturing data from across the eurozone and UK was also generally disappointing. Add in yesterday\u2019s weak US Chicago PMI and Pending Home Sales, together with the year-on-year Euro zone CPI print of -0.3% and you have plenty of evidence that the global economic outlook isn\u2019t exactly glowing. Of course, what this all means for central bank-fixated investors is that further stimulus can\u2019t be far away. Stock market bulls must be praying for a bad US payroll number on Friday to really kibosh the fear of further Fed rate hikes this side of summer. US construction spending is also stronger: And by contrast with the Markit PMI, the manufacturing activity index from the Institute for Supply Management has come in higher than expected. The index came in at 49.5 in February, up from 48.2 in the previous month and better than the 48.5 forecast. This is the highest level since September. The new orders index was flat at 51.5 and the employment index was much stronger than the expected 46.4, coming in at 48.5. Despite the better than expected data, the ISM index still shows a sector in contraction since the figure is below 50. More fuel to the idea that the Federal Reserve will be in no hurry to raise interest rates again. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The February data add to signs of distress in the US manufacturing economy. Production and order book growth continues to worsen, led by falling exports. Jobs are being added at a slower pace and output prices are dropping at a rate not seen since mid-2012. The deterioration in the manufacturing sector\u2019s performance since mid-2014 has broadly tracked the dollar\u2019s rise, which makes US goods more expensive in overseas markets and leads US consumers to favour cheaper imported goods. With other headwinds including the downturn in the oil sector, heightened uncertainty due to financial market volatility, global growth worries and growing concerns about the presidential election, it\u2019s no surprise that the manufacturing sector is facing its toughest period since the global financial crisis. US manufacturing performed marginally better than expected in February but worse than in January. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 51.3 last month, higher than the initial estimate of 51 and the forecast of 51.2. But it was down on the final figure for January of 52.4. The same pattern was seen in the employment index, which at 51.8 was better than the initial estimate of 51.5 but lower than January\u2019s 52.8. The output index at 51.8 was the lowest since October 2013. Ahead of the US manufacturing figures for February - remember there is the Markit PMI followed shortly afterwards by the ISM survey - Wall Street has climbed sharply in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 93 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.8%, as the oil price shows signs of stabilising. Time for a very quick summary. Britain\u2019s factory sector has posted its slowest growth in almost three years. UK manufacturers have been hurt by the weakening global economy and signs of domestic slowdown, and economists fear further problems ahead. Growth across the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector hit a one-year low. Germany and France saw near-stagnation, and firms reported renewed price pressure - a day after the eurozone fell back into deflation. The Eurozone jobless rate has hit a new four and a half-year low. In January, 10.3% of workers were unemployed, around twice the levels in the US and UK. China got the day off to a bad start, with factory activity shrinking again. Analysts say it puts more pressure on Beijing to take further measures to stave off severe economic problems. The financial markets have taken the news well; shares are up across Europe, and the US expected to follow. But there are new signs of unease in the markets, as Japan sells 10-year bonds at a negative yield for the first time ever. Barclays shares have slumped by 10% as investors balk at falling profits and a dividend cut. The London Stock Exchange could be the centre of a tug-of-war, as the owner of the New York stock exchange ponders launching a rival takeover bid. The financial market turmoil of 2015 has knocked around \u00a350bn off the value of the world\u2019s 20 wealthiest people. That\u2019s according to the annual survey of the megarich from Forbes , which reports that Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms tycoon, had a year to forget. His fortune shrank from $77.1bn to $50bn last year. Bill Gates also became a little poorer, but Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg bucked the trend. My colleague Graham Ruddick has read the report, and explains: Bill Gates has been crowned the richest man in the world for the third year in a row, although the Microsoft founder\u2019s fortune also dipped from $79.2bn to $75bn. Zuckerberg\u2019s wealth grew by $11.2bn to give him a total net worth of $44.6bn. Zuckerberg is the sixth richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, Slim, investor Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, the businessman behind the Zara fashion empire, and Gates. Here comes the first slug of economic data from across the Atlantic.... and it show that Brazil\u2019s factory sector shrank at a rapid pace in February. The Brazilian manufacturing PMI, which measures activity at hundreds of firms, fell to a three-month low of 44.5 in February, from 47.4 in January. That\u2019s the second-fastest contraction since the financial crisis in 2008. And firms also saw their costs jump, due to the weakening Brazilian currency. Markit explains: Brazil\u2019s manufacturing recession extended to February, with a further drop in incoming new work leading companies to lower production and cut jobs again. Such was the extent of the downturn that firms shed jobs at the second-fastest pace since April 2009. The weaker real continued to exert upward pressure on input costs, which rose at quickest rate since October 2008. Subsequently, tariffs were raised again, with charge inflation reaching a survey peak. It\u2019s a historic day in the financial markets. For the first time ever, investors have paid Japan for the privilege of lending to it for the next decade. That\u2019s because Japan auctioned 10-year bonds at an interest rate, or yield, of below zero for the first time ever. That means investors agreed to pay more than the face value of the bonds, which Tokyo will repay in 2026. The FT says that Japan has crossed a \u201cfinancial rubicon\u201d; it makes it the first G7 nation to sell 10-year bonds so cheaply. You might think this would be welcome -- government deficits sound less scary when you can borrow for free. But in this case, it means investors are pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects. It also shows the adverse consequences of negative interest rates, which the Bank of Japan imposed last month. Banks lose money on funds left at the BoJ, so they may as well buy 10-year bonds at a small loss instead. But with asset yields so low, it\u2019s going to be even harder for banks to generate profits. And could Germany be next? Ten-year bunds are yielding just 0.13% today.... It\u2019s lunchtime in the City of London, after a morning of generally downbeat economic news. But shares are still up, though. The FTSE 100 has gained 45 points or 0.75% to a two-month high. The prospect of a bidding war has driven London Stock Exchange Group up 8.5% to the top of the leader board. But Barclays has lost 9% to a three-year low, with traders disappointed by today\u2019s results. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the 600 largest listed European companies, is at a one-month high. Investors simply aren\u2019t panicking about the weakness in the world\u2019s factory sectors that we\u2019ve seen today. Instead, they may be cheered by the oil price. US crude is up 1.7% today at $34.33. Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: European markets have a spring in their step this morning, with the FTSE hitting an eight-week high in early trade. The initial anxiety brought about by yet another batch of disappointing Chinese PMI readings overnight proved unfounded, as the slowdown story begins to play less of a role in global sentiment. Wall Street is expected to turn green at the open too. Wondering where you should have invested your hard-earned money (or your clients\u2019) last month? Deutsche Bank has the answer. You should have piled into gold on February 1st, when bullion was $1,128 per ounce. It\u2019s now $1,245 per ounce, up 10%. If you fancied some FX action, buying the yen against the US dollar would have been profitable too (it strengthened from \u00a5121 to \u00a5113 to the $1). And you should have steered well away from wheat. It was the worst performing asset class, amid predictions of decent harvests and ample suppliers. The second worst - the Greek stock market, which slumped in the face of deadlock between the Athens government and its creditors over its latest bailout plan. Legal &amp; General, the UK\u2019s biggest asset manager, has just issued a statement on Britain\u2019s In-Out EU referendum, scheduled for June 23. L&amp;G believes its business would suffer little impact of the UK public vote to leave the European Union, as it has relatively few customers on the continent. However, it also warns that a Brexit vote would probably have some negative effect on the financial markets, and the real economy. L&amp;G says: We consider that a vote to leave would have little direct impact on trading for Legal &amp; General: our customer base is located very largely in the UK, the US and Asia. It is however probable that a vote to exit, with a potentially lengthy period of negotiation and an uncertain outcome, would create uncertainty for markets and the broader UK economy in which we operate. L&amp;G also warns that there is a lack of clarity over the new trade links which Britain would forge after Brexit, and that \u201cthe economic case for leaving is unproven\u201d. So it will keep the issue under review. As one of the largest investors in the UK, we will be actively listening to companies we invest in, who will be assessing the potential impact for themselves. So, quite a balanced view from L&amp;G, who don\u2019t seem terribly alarmed about Brexit. And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal thinks she knows why.... Alan Greenspan was notoriously opaque when he was the world\u2019s top central banker, joking once that \u201cIf I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u201d But the former Federal Reserve chairman has developed a new line in clarity in his older year. Greenspan, who turns 90 on Sunday, has sat down with Bloomberg to talk about the global economy. And he criticised the new vogue towards negative interest rates, as central bankers Asked if charging banks a negative interest rate was dangerous, Greenspan said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say dangerous, but it is clearly not productive.\u201d \u201cThe big argument about excessively low interest rates for a very long period of time is that it warps the investment pattern on real investments.\u201d [As interest rates fall, so does the rate of return which banks get on their assets. However, in a negative interest rate world they cannot keep cutting the cost of their liabilities - customer deposits - without charging savers] Greenspan also warned that \u201cwe\u2019re in trouble\u201d because \u201cproductivity is dead in the water\u201d. Output per hour is driven essentially by real capital investment, and it\u2019s way below average, because business people are very uncertain about the future. More here: Greenspan Says Negative Rates `Warp\u2019 Investment Behavior The sharp slowdown in UK factory growth last month has disappointed analysts. They are worried that domestic demand weakened in February, compounding the impact of weaker demand from overseas. And the EU referendum could weigh on the sector for several months too. Here\u2019s some early reaction: Zach Witton, Deputy Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation \u201cAfter an encouraging start to 2016, the manufacturing PMI took a turn for the worse in February, falling to its lowest level in nearly three years and barely remaining in growth territory. \u201cActivity levels deteriorated on the back of weakness in new orders, with domestic demand no longer compensating for lacklustre export orders. The weakness led manufacturing to post job losses for the fifth time in the last seven months. On a brighter note, the weakness was not across the board as new orders for intermediate goods edged higher. Manufacturers face a challenging environment, with subdued demand from emerging markets and the ongoing weakness of the oil price weighing heavily on companies in the oil and gas supply chain. Against this backdrop, manufacturers will be looking at the forthcoming Budget and will want to see the Chancellor avoid adding significant costs at a time when business conditions are tough.\u201d Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays \u201cThe weak start to the year continues for the manufacturing sector with even domestic demand unable to contribute to the levels it has done previously. However, amidst the headwinds of slowing global growth, uncertainty over a Brexit and skills shortages in the industry comes the recent depreciation in sterling which may just provide the jump-start that manufacturing exporters need to boost exports and put a spark back into the sector\u2019s performance.\u201d Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank. Domestic demand has been the key driver of UK manufacturing in recent months. But with households showing some Brexit jitters too, UK manufacturing might be heading for a rough time until the referendum is out of the way. As long as the UK votes to stay in the EU, domestic demand will likely pick up again thereafter. If the UK votes to eject itself from its biggest market, things may get much rougher, though. The unemployment rate across the eurozone has hit its lowest level since August 2011, the early months of the debt crisis. The eurozone jobless rate ticked down to 10.3% in January 2016, down from 10.4% in December 2015, for the first time since August 2011. That continues the slow recovery since April 2013, when the euro area jobless rate hit 12.3%. But it\u2019s still far too high, especially in Greece and Spain where around one in four are out of work. In the wider EU, the jobless rate dropped to 8.9% from 9.0% - the lowest in over six years. UK factories do have one glimmer of hope -- the recent slump in the pound. Today\u2019s report was conducted before Brexit firms sent sterling down to new seven-year lows, which ought to help exporters.... Barclays shares are being hammered harder, after it reported an 8% fall in profits, halved its dividend and warned of further job cuts. They fell 11% a moment ago, forcing trading to be briefly suspended. More gloom! Britain\u2019s factories have posted their slowest growth in almost three years, as the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector slipped to near-stagnation. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of the sector showed that output slowed sharply, as exports suffered from weakness in the global economy. Firms struggled to attract new business and cut jobs for the second month running. Rob Dobson of Markit says UK firms are being forced to cut prices to attract business, due to weak demand at home and abroad. \u201cThe near-stagnation of manufacturing highlights the ongoing fragility of the economic recovery at the start of the year and provides further cover for the Bank of England\u2019s increasingly dovish stance. \u201cThe breadth of the slowdown is especially worrisome. The domestic market is showing signs of weakening while export business continued to fall. Price pressures also remained firmly on the downside, with the survey signalling input costs falling at a double-digit annual pace and average factory gate selling prices showing a further decline. A lot of this is driven by the ongoing weakness of global commodity prices. However, there are also signs that weaker growth is driving up competition between manufacturers to secure new business and among their suppliers too. European stock markets are taking today\u2019s weak manufacturing data in their stride. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 just touched its highest point since the 5th of January, with mining group Anglo American and fashion chain Burberry among the risers. The Footsie is currently up 0.35% at 6117 points, also helped by the bid battle over the London Stock Exchange (up 7%). That means the London market has clawed back almost all the losses suffered in the great market turmoil in the first few weeks of this year. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 1%, and the French CAC is 0.2% higher. Investors may be concluding that the weak manufacturing data will prompt another bout of stimulus measures from the world\u2019s central banks. It\u2019s official: Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector expanded at the slowest rate in a year last month, fuelling fears that its economy is heading into trouble. The latest Purchasing Managers Index reports, based on data from thousands of firms, shows that the eurozone\u2019s factory sector only expanded modestly. Markit\u2019s eurozone factory PMI hit a 12-month low of 51.2, down from 52.3 in January, dragged down by weakness in the two largest euro economies. Today\u2019s report shows that:\uf0a7 Slower growth of production, new orders, export business and employment France and Germany hover close to stagnation mark; Greece slips back into contraction Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the eurozone faces the threat of sluggish growth in 2016, or a full-blown downturn. \u201cLacklustre domestic demand is being compounded by a worsening global picture. Exports either fell or rose more slowly in all countries surveyed with the sole exception of Austria. \u201cFor a region in desperate need of lower unemployment, the near-stalling of jobs growth in the manufacturing sector comes as disappointing news. Firms are cutting back on their hiring due to worries about the outlook. \u201cPrices are meanwhile being dropped as firms endeavour to boost sales, suggesting deflationary pressures have intensified. Input prices are falling at a rate not seen since July 2009. \u201cWith all indicators \u2013 from output and demand to employment and prices \u2013 turning down, the survey will add pressure on the ECB to act quickly and aggressively to avert another economic downturn.\u201d Growth in Germany\u2019s factory sector has ground to a near-halt, according to Markit. The German manufacturing PMI slowed sharply to 50.5, a 15-month low, from 52.3 in January. New orders, and new exports, both dipped to the slowest growth since last summer. France\u2019s manufacturers remained in near-stagnation last month. The French PMI came in at 50.2, up from 50.0 in January - which showed no growth at all. Companies interviewed by Markit reported a drop in new business, and deflationary pressures. Markit economist Jack Kennedy says: \u201cFalling new orders were again the source of weakness, leading firms to cut production levels slightly. Meanwhile, the survey\u2019s price indices point to continued downward pressure on already low inflation.\u201d Italy\u2019s factory sector didn\u2019t enjoy a great February. The Italian manufacturing PMI has fallen to 52.2, from 53.2 in January. That\u2019s the lowest reading in a year, signalling that growth last month. New orders also rose at the slowest pace since February 2015. The first European PMI reports are out. The Dutch manufacturing sector has reported its slowest growth in 18 months, with the PMI dropping to 51.7 from 52.4. And Spain\u2019s factory PMI has dipped to 54.1, from 55.4. That\u2019s a solid growth rate, and is the 27th month of expansion in a row. Chinese investors have taken today\u2019s weak factory data in their stride. The Shanghai composite index closed 1.7% higher, on hopes that Beijing will heed calls for more stimulus measures. Back to China....and Beijing is reportedly planning to cut up to six million workers from failing companies. The sackings are part of the government\u2019s attempts to clear out its economy and remove excess capacity. Reuters has the story: China aims to lay off 5-6 million workers from \u201czombie enterprises\u201d over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution, two sources with ties to the country\u2019s leadership said. Beijing is trying to rejuvenate its flagging economy by streamlining bloated industrial sectors, starting with coal and steel, but layoffs have emerged as one of the biggest concerns for cash-strapped regions ahead of next week\u2019s annual session of parliament. The government\u2019s plans to lay off five million workers in industries suffering from a supply glut would be the country\u2019s boldest retrenchment programme in almost two decades, one source said. The restructuring of state-owned enterprises from 1998 to 2003 led to around 28 million redundancies and cost the central government about 73.1 billion yuan ($11.2 billion) in resettlement funds. A second source with leadership ties put the number of layoffs at six million. Both sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media about the politically sensitive subject for fear of sparking social unrest. Few things get our blood pumping faster than a takeover battle. And we might have one brewing, over the London Stock Exchange. Shares in the LSE have soared by 8% in early trading, after rival US operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) said it was considering a bid for the LSE. That would put ICE, which owns the New York stock exchagne, toe-to-toe against Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which announced plans for a \u2018merger of equals\u2019 with the LSE last week. ICE has released a statement, confirming it is considering a bid for the LSE, which was enough to get the shares motoring: Shares in Barclays have shed 4% at the start of trading, as traders give their verdict to today\u2019s results. The bank is briefing reporters now: Russia\u2019s factory sector continued to deteriorate last month. The Russian manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 in February, down from 49.8 in January, showing a sharper slowdown. Data firm Markit warned that Russian factories cut jobs again, as Western sanctions and the oil price slump drives the economy towards recession: Disappointingly for goods producers, scrutinising the survey data leaves little encouraging news. Workforce numbers continued to slide while outstanding business was depleted at a sharp pace. Barclays has hit investors with some bad news. The bank is more than halving its dividend, from 6.5p to 3p, after suffering and 8% drop in pre-tax profits. Jill Treanor reports: Chief executive Jes Staley, making his first announcement since taking the helm in December, said he was \u201cannouncing initiatives to accelerate our strategy and simplify the group\u201d as profits fell 8% to \u00a32.1bn in 2015. Staley said the bank would reduce its stake in its African business - which expanded in 2005 when it bought South African bank Absa - and reduce its payout to shareholders. Here\u2019s the full story: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde reckons traders won\u2019t be impressed. Dr. He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group, says today\u2019s PMI report shows that Beijing needs to take more action, fast. \u201cThe Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI for February is 48, down 0.4 points from the previous month. The index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signalled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy\u2019s road to stability remains bumpy. The government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff.\u201d Dr Gerard Lyons, economics advisor to London Mayor Boris Johnson, says it shows why the People\u2019s Bank of China eased monetary policy yesterday (by allowing banks to hold less funds in reserve): Chris Weston of IG agrees that the Chinese economy is getting worse: Chinese PMIs were predictably weak and while no doubt affected by the seasonal disruptions of Chinese Lunar New Year (LNY), the trend of late was pointing to further weakness in any case. In the NBS Manufacturing PMI, the key components of output and new orders both wilted dramatically. Probably of most concern was the renewed collapse in the small companies component, which contracted to 44.4. This emphasises the fact that despite the huge growth in credit in January, most of it is going to the large state-connected corporates while small and medium sized private enterprises continue to struggle. Confusingly, China actually has two PMI reports -- the Caixin one which is so gloomy this month, and a separate survey conducted by the government. And that official PMI confirms that the factory sector shrank last month: The Financial Times has the details: China\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 49 in February from 49.8 in January, equalling its weakest since February 2009 and the seventh straight month of decline. The National Bureau of Statistics, which released the measure, said this was partly due to seasonal effects of the lunar new year holiday, when many factories shut down for extended periods to allow workers to travel to distant hometowns to spend time with their families. The official services sector PMI, which had previously held up better than the manufacturing index in China\u2019s economic slowdown, also slipped last month to 52.7, its weakest level since December 2008. China\u2019s economy has suffered another jolt, with its manufacturing sector shrinking at a faster pace and cutting jobs at the fastest rate since the depths of the financial crisis. It\u2019s a bad start to PMI Day, painting a pretty grim picture of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Data firm Caixin reports that China\u2019s factory sector contracted at the fastest pace in five months. Its Purchasing Managers Index, based on data from hundreds of companies, fell to 48.0 in February, down from 48.4 in January. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, so this shows that the operating conditions faced by Chinese goods producers continued to deteriorate in February. Output and total new orders shrank at a faster rate, and companies slashed staff at the fastest pace since January 2009 -- shortly after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It highlights that Chinese policymakers are still battling against a hard landing, with serious implications for the global economy too. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for economic data, which should give new clues into the health of the world economy. A string of new Purchasing Managers Index surveys will show how the world\u2019s factory sector fared in February, from Asia to Europe to the US. Analysts will be scrutinising them for signs that growth weakened last month, in the face of financial market turbulence and the slowdown in China. We get the main eurozone data between 8.15am and 9am GMT, then the UK at 9.30am, followed by the US around 3pm. The expectations aren\u2019t great, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u2019s latest February manufacturing PMI numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany are expected to reinforce concerns of a gradual manufacturing slowdown, with both the German and French measures expected to show stagnation. The latest UK manufacturing PMI numbers are expected to show further weakness, down from 52.9 to 52.3, though recent sterling weakness might help on the margins. In the US we can expect to see further weakness in the latest ISM manufacturing numbers after a really soft February Chicago PMI manufacturing number yesterday. The sharp jump seen in January saw a sharp reverse to 47.6, with all major components also showing some worrying weakness. Also coming up.... New eurozone unemployment data is released at 10am GMT. It\u2019s likely to show that the jobless remained at around 10.4% in January, underlining the weak European recovery. And on the corporate front, Barclays bank, commodity trading firm Glencore and high street pasty chain Greggs are reporting results. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

Or maybe Freaky Friday, since many commentators were puzzled by the strong recovery today after the slump yesterday which followed ECB president Mario Draghi seemingly playing down further interest rate cuts. Part of the revival came as investors had second thoughts and decided to concentrate on the positive elements of Draghi\u2019s announcement, namely the rate cut he did unveil, the plan to buy corporate bonds and the fact the ECB will be paying banks to lend to companies in an effort to boost the flagging eurozone economy.</p> <p>On top of that, markets were buoyed by a rise in crude as the International Energy Agency said the oil price might have bottomed out and hopes grew that producers would come to an agreement to freeze output. Brent is currently up 0.9% at $40.41.</p> <p>With the ECB stimulus measures outweighing the problem of negative interest rates stretching their balance sheets, banks were among the days main gainers with the Euro Stoxx Banks index ended 6.7% higher at 115. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 1.7% or 103.09 points at 6139.79, albeit down 0.99% on the week, its first weekly fall since the middle of February</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 3.5% to 9831.13</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% higher at 4492.79</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB soared 4.8% to 18,987.73</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.69% at 9090.6</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 566.20</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 217 points or 1.2% higher.</p> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

First, negative interest rates as a tool of monetary policy are effectively exhausted. Second, asset purchases and credit easing will do the heavy lifting of policy stimulus going forward. And third, the ECB is focused on the domestic credit channel to kick-start growth rather than lowering the euro.</p> <p>While the ECB has yet to provide details on its expanded purchase programme, our initial thoughts are that it will purchase about \u20ac4 billion in non-financial corporate bonds per month. By adding corporate bonds to its list of government, agency and covered bonds as well as asset-backed securities, the ECB is now firmly in the realm of credit easing.</p> <p>Although we acknowledge the marginal efficacy of monetary policy is declining, we disagree with the view the ECB has run out of ammunition. There remains a large amount of assets outstanding that the ECB could theoretically purchase. And now that it has started with corporate bonds, blue-chip equities are not a far step away, if ever needed. We concur with President Mario Draghi\u2019s response to the question about helicopter money: We think the ECB is a long way from contemplating forms of monetization, and if history is any lesson, investors aren\u2019t keen on monetization, either.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full commentary is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://blog.pimco.com/2016/03/10/not-giving-up/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_content=not_giving_up&amp;utm_campaign=pimco_blog\">Not Giving Up</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e2eea1e4b0fe99a64e59d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T16:14:03.992Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK government has <strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-permanent-secretary-to-the-treasury-announced\">announced Tom Scholar as the new permanent secretary to the Treasury:</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/708324786972323840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tom Scholar succeeds Sir Nick Macpherson to one of the most important jobs in Whitehall: Permanent Secretary at HM Treasury.</p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/708324786972323840\">March 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Scholar is currently the Prime Minister\u2019s adviser on European and Global Issues and Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat in the Cabinet Office.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T16:15:07.172Z\">at 4.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56e2ec21e4b05e073b780968\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T16:08:39.402Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> This will come as no real surprise, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Bundesbank was opposed to the bigger than expected stimulus package unveiled by ECB president Mario Draghi on Thursday.

The key question now is this recent surge sustainable?

This decline being driven by output losses in Iraq and Nigeria as well as Iran\u2019s post sanction impact not being a large as originally thought. Crucially, US production is now showing monthly declines which may in time lead to a greater dependence upon imports. The IEA is now forecasting that demand will increase by 1.2mmbbl/d this year. We are therefore seeing supply and demand approaching parity which would be very good news for the oil price and would hopefully see prices being more fundamentally driven.</p> <p>So in terms of what is being forecast, things are looking better. However, forecasts can change and I do think that there is quite a lot of hope priced into the oil price on the \u201cbig freeze\u201d idea with Saudi, Russia and a few of the other more junior members of OPEC. We are still awaiting confirmation that the freeze will occur, but this is not expected for a few weeks yet.</p> <p>If as the market expects, the freeze does occur we can hope to see further strengthening of the oil price as we move into the second half of this year.

Its new stimulus is designed to ease the much overdone concerns about the banking system. One aspect of the package apparently irritated markets for a while: the ECB increased the penalty for banks to park deposits at the ECB by just 10bp from -0.3% to -0.4% and suggested that it is reluctant to go into more negative territory for rates. </p> <p>But that is good rather than bad news for banks. The ECB more than offset the small extra penalty for excess deposits by its cut in the refi rate, the scaling up of its asset purchases and the very generous design of its new four-year injections of long-term liquidity. The ECB has shown that it will do its utmost to prevent even a whiff of a new banking crisis and get the economy back to trend growth.

In his view, two things in this piece stand out. One he would welcome, the other he finds thoroughly confusing. </p> <ul> <li>A reality check on fiscal policy and structural reform. Constancio points out that there are significant legal and political constraints on the ability of countries to use fiscal policy to stimulate growth. In his words \u201ccountries that could use fiscal space, won\u2019t; and many that would use it, shouldn\u2019t\u201d. The hint that these constraints may be at least a little unhelpful reflects the drift of opinion on this issue we have been seen of late from the leadership of the ECB. What Constancio has to say about structural reform, however, cuts somewhat against the grain. Pointing out that structural reforms tend to be deflationary in the first instance, he states: \u201cStructural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth, but it is difficult to see how they could spur growth significantly in the next two years, especially when the current problem is lack of global demand\u201d. We agree, and it is refreshing to see the ECB acknowledge this so openly.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why the bound at -0.4%? Having argued that monetary policy has had to step into the void left by other policies, Constancio argues that monetary policy has boosted growth by around two-thirds of a percentage point over the last two years. But \u201call policies have limits. In the case of the instruments, we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility. The reasons are more fundamental than just the effect on banks\u201d.

The pace of growth has slowed somewhat, nominal GDP is lower than we thought it was \u2013 thanks to revisions \u2013 and even public sector borrowing looks likely to have overshot in the current fiscal year (possibly by around GBP5bn). </p> <p>Complicating matters further, the UK\u2019s EU referendum looms large. While we had expected the chancellor to be forecasting a boost to revenues from pensions tax reforms, widespread media reports suggest this will no longer be the case. So, if he is to keep to his own ambitious fiscal goals, he will likely have to introduce further cuts, probably to departmental spending. With oil prices back on the rise, he may also see this as his last chance to increase fuel duties.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e2afd9e4b0b2eee93d5220\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T12:07:36.108Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Aside from the budget on Wednesday, the other highlight in the UK next week will be the Bank of England\u2019s monthly meeting.</strong> The decision and the meeting minutes will be released at noon on Thursday. </p> <p>The City is not expecting any changes to the Bank rate at 0.5% and the asset buying programme of \u00a3375bn. Investec economist Chris Hare is wondering whether we will see a more dovish tone from the monetary policy committee.</p> <p>Analysts at HSBC say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The MPC has been sounding remarkably dovish of late. Not as dovish as the rates market, which is now not pricing-in a rate rise until 2020, but dovish nonetheless. Indeed, since the last meeting, the survey data has been disappointing, suggesting the pace of activity in the UK could be slowing. </p> <p>The most recent releases of CPI inflation (February) and wage growth (December) were actually a touch higher than the BoE had expected, and oil prices in sterling terms are up 18% since the last meeting. But this is unlikely to outweigh the backdrop of a volatile global climate, slowing domestic activity and the imminent referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership. We expect all nine MPC members to vote to keep rates on hold. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The US Federal Reserve is also meeting next week and will announce its policy decision at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday.

                "bodyText":"After Terrible Thursday came Fantastic Friday. Or maybe Freaky Friday, since many commentators were puzzled by the strong recovery today after the slump yesterday which followed ECB president Mario Draghi seemingly playing down further interest rate cuts. Part of the revival came as investors had second thoughts and decided to concentrate on the positive elements of Draghi\u2019s announcement, namely the rate cut he did unveil, the plan to buy corporate bonds and the fact the ECB will be paying banks to lend to companies in an effort to boost the flagging eurozone economy. On top of that, markets were buoyed by a rise in crude as the International Energy Agency said the oil price might have bottomed out and hopes grew that producers would come to an agreement to freeze output. Brent is currently up 0.9% at $40.41. With the ECB stimulus measures outweighing the problem of negative interest rates stretching their balance sheets, banks were among the days main gainers with the Euro Stoxx Banks index ended 6.7% higher at 115. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.7% or 103.09 points at 6139.79, albeit down 0.99% on the week, its first weekly fall since the middle of February Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 3.5% to 9831.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% higher at 4492.79 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB soared 4.8% to 18,987.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.69% at 9090.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 566.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 217 points or 1.2% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week for, among other things, the UK budget and the latest interest rate decisoins from the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: After markets tanked on Thursday it was bounce-back Friday. On the one hand this feels like a bet on central bankers and how far they are willing to go in their pursuit of pumping up the economy. On the other hand it feels like a desperate play; where else do investors put their money to gain a decent income? Markets have given a - belated - vote of confidence to the ECB stimulus package, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: Investors seem more willing to give Mario Draghi the benefit of the doubt today, having sulked yesterday afternoon. Markets in the UK, Europe and the US are racing higher, with the plan apparently being to put the madness of Thursday\u2019s session firmly behind them. Overall it looks like the ECB has been given a vote of confidence, even if it took 24 hours for the result to come through. The session has been somewhat spoiled as oil has failed to hold on to its gains for the day, but the resilience of crude prices this week has come as a rude shock to those that thought a sell-off would develop. Dip buyers in both equities and crude oil continue to be rewarded for their bravery, so it look like these price moves are set to extend into the second half of March. Brent crude, by the way, is still in positive territory - up 0.8% at $40.37 a barrel -but off its earlier highs of $41.03. Despite concerns that the ECB - and indeed other central banks - might be running out of ammunition in their attempts to stimulate economic growth, this is not the case according to bond manager Pimco. Commenting on Thursday\u2019s ECB package Andrew Bosomworth, head of Pimco\u2019s portfolio management in Germany, said: The ECB\u2019s decisions sent three signals. First, negative interest rates as a tool of monetary policy are effectively exhausted. Second, asset purchases and credit easing will do the heavy lifting of policy stimulus going forward. And third, the ECB is focused on the domestic credit channel to kick-start growth rather than lowering the euro. While the ECB has yet to provide details on its expanded purchase programme, our initial thoughts are that it will purchase about \u20ac4 billion in non-financial corporate bonds per month. By adding corporate bonds to its list of government, agency and covered bonds as well as asset-backed securities, the ECB is now firmly in the realm of credit easing. Although we acknowledge the marginal efficacy of monetary policy is declining, we disagree with the view the ECB has run out of ammunition. There remains a large amount of assets outstanding that the ECB could theoretically purchase. And now that it has started with corporate bonds, blue-chip equities are not a far step away, if ever needed. We concur with President Mario Draghi\u2019s response to the question about helicopter money: We think the ECB is a long way from contemplating forms of monetization, and if history is any lesson, investors aren\u2019t keen on monetization, either. The full commentary is here: Not Giving Up The UK government has announced Tom Scholar as the new permanent secretary to the Treasury: Scholar is currently the Prime Minister\u2019s adviser on European and Global Issues and Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. This will come as no real surprise, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Bundesbank was opposed to the bigger than expected stimulus package unveiled by ECB president Mario Draghi on Thursday. It said (\u00a3): Germany\u2019s Bundesbank opposed the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus package as structured Thursday and fears a \u201cdoom loop\u201d of high market expectations followed by disappointment, people familiar with the matter said. Worth remembering of course that because of the ECB\u2019s rotation policy, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann had no vote at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Meanwhile CNBC has suggested that Draghi\u2019s later comments at the press conference suggesting rates would not fall further could have been an olive branch to dissenters (presumably the Bundesbank). Much of the future direction of the oil price depends on the outcome of any talks between producers to freeze output, says Dougie Youngson, head of oil and gas research at FinnCap: Brent finally broke through $41 a barrel, its highest level since December last year. The key question now is this recent surge sustainable? Forecasts from both the IEA and EIA are showing that non-OPEC production if declining over this year and next. This decline being driven by output losses in Iraq and Nigeria as well as Iran\u2019s post sanction impact not being a large as originally thought. Crucially, US production is now showing monthly declines which may in time lead to a greater dependence upon imports. The IEA is now forecasting that demand will increase by 1.2mmbbl/d this year. We are therefore seeing supply and demand approaching parity which would be very good news for the oil price and would hopefully see prices being more fundamentally driven. So in terms of what is being forecast, things are looking better. However, forecasts can change and I do think that there is quite a lot of hope priced into the oil price on the \u201cbig freeze\u201d idea with Saudi, Russia and a few of the other more junior members of OPEC. We are still awaiting confirmation that the freeze will occur, but this is not expected for a few weeks yet. If as the market expects, the freeze does occur we can hope to see further strengthening of the oil price as we move into the second half of this year. Hope springs eternal\u2026 US markets have followed the lead from Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 179 points or just over 1%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq have also recorded similar percentage gains. The recovery came as investors had second - and more positive - thoughts about the European Central Banks stimulus measures announced on Thursday. A rise in the crude price, with Brent currently up 2% at $40.85, also helped sentiment. The International Energy Agency said today the oil price may have bottomed out, while there are continuing hopes that producers may agree to act to curb the supply glut. In the UK, MPs have criticised a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee for not mentioning the risks posed by Brexit in her evidence at a hearing for her reappointment. The Treasury committee said Dame Clara Furse\u2019s written evidence was a cause for concern, but it still approved her re-appointment, as well as that of Richard Sharp. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: As with her appointment hearing in 2013, parts of Dame Clara\u2019s evidence were a source of concern to the Committee. The Committee was in agreement that Dame Clara did not appear to have taken enough care with her written evidence. The Committee found it surprising that Dame Clara had not only omitted any reference to the financial stability risks posed by Brexit but, when asked why, appeared unable to provide a clear explanation [for neglecting it]. Here\u2019s Reuters take on the comments by ECB vice-president today, in the wake of the market volatility caused by president Mario Draghi announcing a bold stimulus package only to undermine it almost immediately by saying that there may be no more rate cuts: The European Central Bank\u2019s negative deposit rate is facing limits, the ECB\u2019s vice-president said on Friday. \u201cNaturally, all policies have limits,\u201d Vitor Constancio said in an opinion piece published on the bank\u2019s website and entitled \u2018In defence of Monetary Policy\u2019. \u201cIn the case of the instruments we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility.\u201d ECB President Mario Draghi sent the euro and yields on short-term government bonds rallying on Thursday when he said the bank did not anticipate any further rate cut after the ones he had just announced. \u201cA succession of scares haunted global markets in the first six weeks of 2016\u201d \u2013 but \u201cone by one these concerns are now being debunked by reality and policy makers,\u201d writes Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German bank Berenberg. He concludes: China \u2013 no hard landing. Oil prices \u2013 no reason to worry. US \u2013 on track. ECB \u2013 good for banks, good for the economy. On the latter point: The ECB did not just exceed expectations with its comprehensive policy package of 10 March. Its new stimulus is designed to ease the much overdone concerns about the banking system. One aspect of the package apparently irritated markets for a while: the ECB increased the penalty for banks to park deposits at the ECB by just 10bp from -0.3% to -0.4% and suggested that it is reluctant to go into more negative territory for rates. But that is good rather than bad news for banks. The ECB more than offset the small extra penalty for excess deposits by its cut in the refi rate, the scaling up of its asset purchases and the very generous design of its new four-year injections of long-term liquidity. The ECB has shown that it will do its utmost to prevent even a whiff of a new banking crisis and get the economy back to trend growth. Do not bet against Draghi.\u201d ECB vice president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio has published an \u201copinion piece\u201d on the ECB website, entitled \u201cIn Defence of Monetary Policy\u201d \u2013 an unusual step the day after an ECB decision. Malcolm Barr at JPMorgan Chase says he can\u2019t recall any instances of senior ECB officials putting pen to paper (as opposed to giving interviews) so soon after an ECB decision. In his view, two things in this piece stand out. One he would welcome, the other he finds thoroughly confusing. A reality check on fiscal policy and structural reform. Constancio points out that there are significant legal and political constraints on the ability of countries to use fiscal policy to stimulate growth. In his words \u201ccountries that could use fiscal space, won\u2019t; and many that would use it, shouldn\u2019t\u201d. The hint that these constraints may be at least a little unhelpful reflects the drift of opinion on this issue we have been seen of late from the leadership of the ECB. What Constancio has to say about structural reform, however, cuts somewhat against the grain. Pointing out that structural reforms tend to be deflationary in the first instance, he states: \u201cStructural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth, but it is difficult to see how they could spur growth significantly in the next two years, especially when the current problem is lack of global demand\u201d. We agree, and it is refreshing to see the ECB acknowledge this so openly. Why the bound at -0.4%? Having argued that monetary policy has had to step into the void left by other policies, Constancio argues that monetary policy has boosted growth by around two-thirds of a percentage point over the last two years. But \u201call policies have limits. In the case of the instruments, we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility. The reasons are more fundamental than just the effect on banks\u201d. At this point Constancio cites a recent blog by Cecchetti and Schoenholtz, before pointing out that bank returns on equity in the Euro area went up in 2015 despite negative rates. But if it is not the impact on bank profitability that sets a limit to the usefulness of negative rates, then what is the \u201cmore fundamental\u201d reason? Wall Street\u2019s late recovery overnight - the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down just 5 points after falling nearly 180 points at one stage - was one of the reasons European markets got off to a good start today. And the US futures are suggesting a bright start when trading begins in a couple of hours time, with the Dow forecast to open up around 150 points. Turning to the UK budget next Wednesday lunchtime, the HSBC analysts say that A lot has changed since chancellor George Osborne delivered his upbeat autumn statement last November. The pace of growth has slowed somewhat, nominal GDP is lower than we thought it was \u2013 thanks to revisions \u2013 and even public sector borrowing looks likely to have overshot in the current fiscal year (possibly by around GBP5bn). Complicating matters further, the UK\u2019s EU referendum looms large. While we had expected the chancellor to be forecasting a boost to revenues from pensions tax reforms, widespread media reports suggest this will no longer be the case. So, if he is to keep to his own ambitious fiscal goals, he will likely have to introduce further cuts, probably to departmental spending. With oil prices back on the rise, he may also see this as his last chance to increase fuel duties.\u201d Aside from the budget on Wednesday, the other highlight in the UK next week will be the Bank of England\u2019s monthly meeting. The decision and the meeting minutes will be released at noon on Thursday. The City is not expecting any changes to the Bank rate at 0.5% and the asset buying programme of \u00a3375bn. Investec economist Chris Hare is wondering whether we will see a more dovish tone from the monetary policy committee. Analysts at HSBC say: The MPC has been sounding remarkably dovish of late. Not as dovish as the rates market, which is now not pricing-in a rate rise until 2020, but dovish nonetheless. Indeed, since the last meeting, the survey data has been disappointing, suggesting the pace of activity in the UK could be slowing. The most recent releases of CPI inflation (February) and wage growth (December) were actually a touch higher than the BoE had expected, and oil prices in sterling terms are up 18% since the last meeting. But this is unlikely to outweigh the backdrop of a volatile global climate, slowing domestic activity and the imminent referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership. We expect all nine MPC members to vote to keep rates on hold. The US Federal Reserve is also meeting next week and will announce its policy decision at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. Again, no change is expected. Not only has Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley berated a parliamentary committee for trying to force him to give evidence, accusing MPs of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic,\u201d but he has also sacked Newcastle United coach Steve McClaren (Ashley owns the football club). Oil giant BP has scrapped its long-term sponsorship of Tate Britain, in light of the recent oil price rout. Meanwhile, the Economist has looked at a kitschy animated video about China\u2019s latest five-year economic plan. \u201cEvery five years in China, man; They make a new development plan,\u201d goes the country-style ditty. You can read the piece here. Time for a look at the markets. The FTSE 100 in London is holding on to its gains, trading 1.6% higher \u2013 a gain of nearly 100 points \u2013 at 6134.35. All the main European stock markets are recording strong gains. The Dax in Frankfurt and the CAC in Paris are both 2.8% ahead while Spain\u2019s Ibex bounced 2.9%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped more than 4%. The continued recovery in oil prices has helped, with Brent crude up 2% to $40.85 a barrel. The International Energy Agency said today that oil prices may have bottomed. Traders also seem to have concluded that yesterday\u2019s sell-off was overdone. It is worth noting that the European Central Bank sought to mitigate the impact of negative interest rates banks\u2019 balance sheets by offering to pay them for lending to companies in the eurozone. Back to the ECB. Here\u2019s a good (and fun) explanation of what happened yesterday from Jim Reid, head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank. I suppose if I was trying to explain yesterday\u2019s ECB meeting to a child it might go something like this. Imagine you were expecting a trip during school holidays in a caravan around the country but instead you can take 2 weeks off school, fly first class to Disneyworld, have a go in the cockpit on the way, stay at a hotel made of chocolate, and then be able to go on every ride every day without queuing and have a private play session with the real Mickey Mouse as each day draws to a close. However if the market was the same kid its reaction yesterday was \u201cdo I not get unlimited spending money, and where are we going for our summer holidays then?\u201d Given that Draghi over-delivered on most measures one can only wonder what the market reaction would have been if he had under delivered and stuck to the caravan trip. In reality he probably didn\u2019t help matters by suggesting the ECB saw no need to cut rates further early in his press conference... However to give that comment some perspective when does a central banker ever say \u201cwe\u2019re not sure if this will work so we may have to do more further down the road\u201d? So that specific reaction was a little surprising.\u201d The Royal Statistical Society also welcomed the final report of the independent review led by Bean, and called on the chancellor to implement its recommendations in next week\u2019s budget to ensure gaps in the official statistics are plugged. Mike Hughes, chair of the RSS national statistics advisory group, said: The Bean Review is a substantial and important piece of work. It shows how the UK can have the data we need to drive our economy. We now look to the chancellor to allocate the resources in next week\u2019s budget to make this happen.\u201d Sir Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, welcomed Bean\u2019s recommendations. The Authority welcomes Sir Charles\u2019s recommendations, which set out a compelling vision for economic statistics and alongside the Authority strategy Better Statistics, Better Decisions, will help to deliver high quality economic statistics The Authority will now take time to read and consider the report and its findings.\u201d The UK\u2019s economic growth rate would be higher if its official statistics fully captured all the activity in the economy \u2013 including the digital boom, according to former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean. \u201cTake economic statistics back to the future,\u201d he says in his review of government statistics. He recommended that the Office for National Statistics set up a new research centre to come up with better ways of measuring digital activity. Bean\u2019s conclusions, published here, build on his interim findings from last year. Current statistics were designed over 50 years ago when the economy was dominated by goods, not services. It argues that the digital revolution has changed the way many businesses operate such as Amazon and Skype; given rise to new ways of exchanging and providing services (Airbnb, TaskRabbit); and has muddied the waters between work and leisure, and made it far harder to accurately measure economic output. Many businesses also operate across national borders and depend on intangible assets, which makes it harder to capture their output. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has said it had reached a preliminary agreement with the London Stock Exchange on a framework for a planned stock trading link. The two exchanges will now conduct more detailed studies into the feasibility of a Shanghai-London scheme. Over in Greece, industrial output rose 4.6% in January from a year earlier, following a 6.2% increase in December, according to the country\u2019s statistics service ELSTAT. Manufacturers boosted output by 5.% but mining output slumped 13.6%, while electricity production went up 6.8%. Here is some reaction to the UK trade data from Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who says trade is likely to be a drag on overall economic growth again in the first quarter. January\u2019s trade figures show that the UK\u2019s economic recovery remains worryingly unbalanced. The volume of goods imports in January was 0.4% above its Q4 average, while the volume of goods exports was 1.1% below it Q4 average. Admittedly, imports have been very volatile from recently, and the 20.8% month-to-month surge in food, beverage and tobacco import volumes in January likely will be reversed in February. But we expect the trade deficit to remain bloated this year. Past experience suggests it will take at least a year for sterling\u2019s recent depreciation to boost exports. By contrast, the weaker exchange rate will boost import prices relatively swiftly, thereby worsening the trade deficit in the near-term. With global trade flows weak too and the UK\u2019s recovery likely to remain heavily dependent on consumers, we expect net trade to continue to impede the economic recovery this year.\u201d France\u2019s top public auditor has branded EDF\u2019s \u00a318bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset as potentially risky. The Cour des Comptes \u2013 the French equivalent of the UK\u2019s National Audit Office \u2013 said EDF, which is 85% state owned, should take a close look at the risks associated with the \u00a318bn project to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. The auditor said: Even though the [Hinkley Point] deal has not been finalised, the complexity of the deal and especially the way it could impact the responsibility of EDF suffice to raise serious questions.\u201d You can read more here. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s construction industry had a bad start to the year. Output unexpectedly dropped by 0.2% in January after rising 2.1% in December, confounding expectations of an increase. However, in the fourth quarter of last year construction output grew by 0.3%, rather than falling 0.4%, according to revised figures from the statistics\u2019 office. The UK trade figures are out. They are a mixed bag: Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit shrank to \u00a33.5bn in January from a revised \u00a33.7bn in December, according to official figures. However, the shortfall with the European Union ballooned to a record high of \u00a38.1bn from \u00a37.4bn as Britain imported more from Europe. The Office for National Statistics\u2019 website has all the details. Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley has accused MPs of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic\u201d, claiming they are abusing parliamentary procedure by trying to force him to give evidence to a committee, my colleague Sean Farrell writes. In a letter to Iain Wright, chairman of the business, innovation and skills committee, Ashley said he was disgusted by the MPs\u2019 approach. On Wednesday, the committee warned Ashley publicly that he risked being in contempt of parliament if he failed to appear. Ashley wrote: \u201cI was disgusted to learn that you have adopted a stance that is deliberately antagonistic.\u201d He accused Wright of trying to create a \u201cmedia circus\u201d by summoning him. The letter\u2019s contents were reported in the Times on Friday and confirmed by Ashley\u2019s spokesman. The British Chambers of Commerce has cut its forecasts for UK economic growth, blaming the weaker global economy, and described Britain\u2019s performance as \u201cmediocre\u201d compared to the past. The BCC now expects GDP to rise by 2.2% this year and 2.3% in 2017k similar to growth in 2015 and down from its estimates of 2.5% for 2016 and 2017 in December. Other forecasters have made similar downgrades this year. The business lobby group\u2019s acting director general Adam Marshall said: The UK\u2019s economic performance is reasonably good when measured against our main competitors, but it\u2019s only mediocre when compared against long-term trends.\u201d The BCC urged UK chancellor George Osborne to use his budget next Wednesday to boost investment in transport and digital infrastructure. It made no mention of the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU on 23 June. The organisation\u2019s director general John Longworth quit this week after saying he wanted Britain to leave the EU, which the BCC\u2019s president said breached its neutral position on the EU. The International Energy Agency has called the bottom of the oil price rout, in a significant shift from last month\u2019s outlook. There are signs that prices might have bottomed out. For prices there may be light at the end of what has been a long, dark tunnel.\u201d The Paris-based organisation added in its monthly market report that market forces are \u201cworking their magic and higher-cost producers are cutting output.\u201d Last month, it was still predicting that crude had further to fall, arguing that the market remained \u201cawash in oil\u201d. The agency is now forecasting that oil production outside the Opec cartel will fall by 750,000 barrels a day this year \u2013 150,000 barrels a day more than it estimated last month. Output losses in Iraq and Nigeria will also underpin markets, it said, and also noted that Iran is restoring production more slowly than planned after sanctions were lifted. Oil prices are up 50% from the 12-year lows hit in January. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained 1.4% today to $40.62 a barrel. David Kohl, chief currency strategist and head economist Germany at Swiss private banking group Julius Baer, has concluded: The ECB delivered as much as it could do and even managed to surpass expectations. The unconvincing financial market reaction points to a diminishing power of central banks over asset prices.\u201d The FTSE 100 index is now some 90 points ahead at 6127.21, a gain of more than 90 points, underpinned by a recovery in oil prices. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC have jumped more than 2%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Effectively wiping the slate clean after its last minute plunge on Thursday evening the FTSE surged 1.5% this morning, lifted by a recovery from Brent crude that sees the commodity back nearing its recent highs after plunging past the $40 mark following yesterday\u2019s breakdown in talks between OPEC and non-OPEC members. That left the oil and mining stocks in a healthy shade of green, the usual 2016 pre-requisite for the FTSE posting any growth. Still to come are the UK trade deficit figures, expected to widen to \u00a310.3 billion from last month\u2019s \u00a39.9 billion, something that could slightly knock the FTSE\u2019s morning confidence as the day goes on. Much like the FTSE the eurozone indices had a disastrous end to Thursday; investors fled the region after Draghi stabbed his own stimulus package in the back by suggesting that there is no more room to cut the benchmark interest rate, leaving many to question what the ECB has left in its arsenal if this round of measure doesn\u2019t work. Friday morning, however, has seen something of a rebound; the DAX and CAC both rose around 1.8% after the bell, with investors seemingly reassessing their previously schizophrenic reaction to the ECB announcement. Eurozone bond markets have stabilised after yesterday\u2019s sell-off, triggered by ECB president Mario Draghi saying he did not anticipate further rate cuts, which rapidly dampened enthusiasm for the central bank\u2019s big package of stimulus measures. The ECB sprang a surprise on markets by cutting all main interest rates and boosting its quantitative easing programme to \u20ac80bn from \u20ac60bn a month. It said it would start buying corporate debt and offered to pay banks for lending to companies in the eurozone in an attempt to boost economic growth and ward off deflation. But then Draghi sent markets into a tailspin with the comment that rates may have reached the bottom. Today, two-year German government bond yields are on course for their biggest weekly rise since early December, although ten-year German Bund yields fell. On a light day for corporate news, Old Mutual has said it would split up the company into four main units to save money. Shares in the Anglo-South African financial services group have risen 1.5% on the news. British pubs group JD Wetherspoon has seen first-half pretax profits dip nearly 4% and chairman Tim Martin complained once again that government tax policy was penalising pubs and restaurants, struggling to compete with supermarkets selling cheap booze. Watkin Jones, which builds student accommodation in the UK, is eyeing a London float. It is expected to be valued at \u00a3255m when it lists on the Alternative Investment Market later this month. The firm wants to expand into the booming private rented sector. It said it had the capacity to deliver at least 10 student halls each year. It has 31 developments with 11,300 beds in the pipeline at the moment. As we reported recently, investors have been piling into student housing and student rents are rising steadily. A record \u00a36bn was invested in purpose-built housing in the UK last year \u2013 more than in north America. Investors are attracted by the high income returns due to strong demand: students numbers are rising every year and there is a shortage of adequate accommodation. And we\u2019re off. The FTSE 100 in London has jumped nearly 1.7% to 6136.84 in the first few minutes of trading, a gain of about 100 points, no doubt helped by the rise in oil prices. Brent crude has gained 1.6% to $40.69 a barrel. There aren\u2019t any fallers on the UK benchmark index at the moment \u2013 only risers. European shares are also up strongly. Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 1.9%, France\u2019s CAC is up 1.7% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has leapt 2.1%. It\u2019s a light day for economic news. The highlight will be UK trade and construction data for January at 9.30am GMT. In December, the goods and services trade deficit shrank to \u00a32.7bn, from \u00a34bn in November. But Investec economist Chris Hare said: Despite the narrowing in the overall deficit last month\u2019s numbers do not fill us with optimism, at least for the near term. In part, that is because the turnaround was driven by a 3.6% fall in import values, while exports fell by 0.8%. Within that, services exports fared particularly poorly. Lingering effects of past rises in the pound could be playing a role here, as could the challenging global environment. Recent falls in sterling should help boost net trade going forward, but this might take a few months to come through meaningfully. He is expecting the goods and services shortfall to widen to \u00a33.2bn, with the goods deficit rising to \u00a310.3bn from \u00a39.9bn. It\u2019s the day after the European Central Bank unveiled an unprecedented package of growth-boosting measures, including rate cuts and a boost to its asset-buying programme. Stock markets initially surged and the euro plunged as ECB president Mario Draghi \u201coverdelivered\u201d \u2013 only to go into reverse when he suggested that interest rates may have hit the bottom. Analysts termed it \u201cDraghi shoots down his own bazooka\u201d (Investec) or \u201cDraghi\u2019s bazooka misfires\u201d (CMC Markets UK). After a rollercoaster ride, European stock markets ended the day lower, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 index losing 1.8% to 6036.70, its lowest close since late February. The euro dropped by a cent and a half to $1.0825 against the dollar, but then jumped more than 3% from its lows. Wall Street was flat yesterday after a volatile session. In Asia, traders were unsure how to react and stocks initially followed European shares lower but then rose across the board. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.5% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 0.8%. European markets are expected to take their cue from Asia and open higher as traders digest the ECB\u2019s measures. Stock futures suggest that the FTSE 100 could rise as much as 1.5% at the open, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are also seen rising by 1% or more. But following yesterday\u2019s falls, European stock markets could well finish the week lower for the first time since mid-February.",

                "bodyText":"Online grocer Ocado has insisted it is growing in confidence, as it revealed a double-digit increase in sales but yet again failed to provide news on a much-awaited overseas partnership. Its shares rose 3% after it reported that group sales had increased 15.3% to \u00a3312.4m in the 12 weeks to 21 February and that the average number of orders a week had risen to 214,000. However, the average size of shoppers\u2019 order slipped by 2.9%, Ocado added. Tim Steiner, its chief executive, said the company had recently shipped 250,000 orders in a single week for the first time. \u201cWe are pleased with the steady progress in our business, maintaining double-digit sales growth in a retail environment that remains challenging,\u201d he added. Ocado\u2019s pace of growth far outstrips that of traditional grocers, most of which have seen sales fall as shoppers switch to buying online or in small local stores. The big supermarket chains have also been forced to cut prices in the face of rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. City analysts are concerned that Ocado has yet to find a partner which wants to use its technology outside the UK \u2013 a key part of the business\u2019s strategy. A deal with supermarket Morrisons in October 2013 transformed the view of Ocado, sending its share price soaring. Ocado had promised it would sign an international partner by the end of last year. Duncan Tatton-Brown, its finance director, said the company was still on track to sign \u201cmultiple partners in the medium term. This is not a race. It isn\u2019t that if we don\u2019t sign in the first couple of months of this year we have failed. This is a long term game and we are building our capabilities and talking to partners around the world.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have more not less confidence and Morrisons is an example of that.\u201d Ocado is in talks with Morrisons about expanding their agreement to deliver online groceries from the former\u2019s new distribution centre in Erith, south-east London. Morrisons also wants to expand into parts of the UK not covered by Ocado\u2019s network by picking goods from its own stores. Tatton-Brown said those talks did not indicate a problem with the Ocado model. \u201cWe never envisaged that in the short term we would be able to deliver a centrally picked order to customers north of Aberdeen. We always envisaged a different solution to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think our model is suited to the extremities of the UK.\u201d Tatton-Brown also sought to put a positive spin on Morrisons\u2019 recent deal to provide food to online retailer Amazon. He said: \u201cWe are encouraged that more and more players want to be in that space. This is about moving UK consumers to shift more of their spend online.\u201d Ray Gaul of analysis firm Kantar Retail, said that deal was \u201ccasting doubt on the long-term growth prospects and profitability of the Morrisons partnership\u201d. In December, Ocado\u2019s share price slid back after Amazon said it would rapidly expand its grocery delivery service in the UK and that the British business faced competition in signing up international partners. The Morrisons deal with Amazon has only compounded those worries. \u201cInvestors are losing patience with [Ocado chairman] Lord Rose and Tim Steiner\u2019s promises to diversify into international markets and sign retailers up to the Ocado smartplatform business-to-business software solution,\u201d Gaul said.",

                "body":"<p>Measures targeted at an army of overseas sellers using Amazon and eBay to evade VAT were at the heart of a \u00a312bn tax clampdown announced by the chancellor.</p> <p>A host of other tax avoidance strategies were also in George Osborne\u2019s sights. They ranged from schemes that disguised an individual\u2019s earnings as loans, to businesses taking on commercially unnecessary borrowings to lower their tax bills. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He also <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508154/M1070_amended_final_TN_v2_0__2_.pdf\">signaled a determination to tackle</a> multinational corporations using a complex international chain of intra-group royalty fees to shift taxable income from the UK to tax havens. Well-known multinationals, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/starbucks-fiat-chrysler-tax-bill-ec-rule-deal-illegal\">Starbucks </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/mcdonalds-suspected-sweetheart-tax-arrangements-luxembourg\">McDonald\u2019s</a>, have been accused of aggressively using royalty payments to shift taxable income from the UK.</p> <p>Many of the anti-avoidance measures paraded by Osborne on Wednesday had already been agreed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/oecd-hopes-reforms-will-end-era-of-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">last October as part of a programme of international reform</a> organised through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p> <p>Among them was a cap on the tax deductions that companies can claim for interest payments arising from internal group loans. The prevalence of commercially pointless loans in tax planning was highlighted two years ago by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">Luxleaks scandal</a>. It showed how scores of multinationals were using billions of pounds of internal group lending, routed through Luxembourg, to avoid tax.<br></p> <p>On Wednesday, however, the chancellor made it clear that the UK would adopt only the mildest of reforms recommended the OECD \u2013 a club of rich nations \u2013 in an attempt to tackle this abuse. <br></p> <p>Nevertheless, the Treasury forecasts that caps on interest deductibility will generate \u00a33.97bn in extra tax over the next four years. <br></p> <p>There were meaures aimed at individuals too. Osborne announced fresh measures to tackle avoidance schemes that used so-called offshore \u201cemployee benefit trusts\u201d (EBTs). Tax planners have been building clever schemes using EBTs for many years, much to HMRC\u2019s frustration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the chancellor said a crackdown on a raft of measures used by high earners to disguise their earnings as other income had generated \u00a3100m more than expected. However, industrious tax planners had begun finding new ways around the legislation, requiring another round of crackdowns in this area. <br></p> <p>Disguised earnings have been the cause of much embarrassment for high-profile celebrities in recent years, including the comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/21/jimmy-carr-apologises-error-tax\">Jimmy Carr</a>.</p> <p>Responding to new VAT evasion challenges presented by the booming digital economy, Osborne said tax inspectors would be given <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2016-documents/budget-2016#policy-decisions\">new powers to warn</a> overseas sellers active in the UK through eBay and Amazon.

                "bodyText":"Measures targeted at an army of overseas sellers using Amazon and eBay to evade VAT were at the heart of a \u00a312bn tax clampdown announced by the chancellor. A host of other tax avoidance strategies were also in George Osborne\u2019s sights. They ranged from schemes that disguised an individual\u2019s earnings as loans, to businesses taking on commercially unnecessary borrowings to lower their tax bills. He also signaled a determination to tackle multinational corporations using a complex international chain of intra-group royalty fees to shift taxable income from the UK to tax havens. Well-known multinationals, including Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, have been accused of aggressively using royalty payments to shift taxable income from the UK. Many of the anti-avoidance measures paraded by Osborne on Wednesday had already been agreed last October as part of a programme of international reform organised through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Among them was a cap on the tax deductions that companies can claim for interest payments arising from internal group loans. The prevalence of commercially pointless loans in tax planning was highlighted two years ago by the Luxleaks scandal. It showed how scores of multinationals were using billions of pounds of internal group lending, routed through Luxembourg, to avoid tax. On Wednesday, however, the chancellor made it clear that the UK would adopt only the mildest of reforms recommended the OECD \u2013 a club of rich nations \u2013 in an attempt to tackle this abuse. Nevertheless, the Treasury forecasts that caps on interest deductibility will generate \u00a33.97bn in extra tax over the next four years. There were meaures aimed at individuals too. Osborne announced fresh measures to tackle avoidance schemes that used so-called offshore \u201cemployee benefit trusts\u201d (EBTs). Tax planners have been building clever schemes using EBTs for many years, much to HMRC\u2019s frustration. Meanwhile, the chancellor said a crackdown on a raft of measures used by high earners to disguise their earnings as other income had generated \u00a3100m more than expected. However, industrious tax planners had begun finding new ways around the legislation, requiring another round of crackdowns in this area. Disguised earnings have been the cause of much embarrassment for high-profile celebrities in recent years, including the comedian Jimmy Carr. Responding to new VAT evasion challenges presented by the booming digital economy, Osborne said tax inspectors would be given new powers to warn overseas sellers active in the UK through eBay and Amazon. If, after those warnings, sellers did not collect VAT correctly within 30 days, then eBay and Amazon could be held liable for the missing tax. The Treasury estimates this measure will recoup \u00a3875m in lost VAT receipts over the next four years \u2013 although it is not expected to halt tax fraud altogether. The total cost to the taxpayer of this abuse was officially estimated at up to \u00a31.5bn a year. In Wednesday\u2019s budget speech, Osborne acknowledged there had been a big rise in overseas suppliers storing goods in Britain and selling them online without paying VAT. \u201cThat unfairly undercuts British businesses both on the internet and on the high street,\u201d he said. Responding to the move, eBay said it welcomed \u201crules that ensure a fair marketplace\u201d, but insisted it already took prompt action when alerted by HMRC to problem sellers not complying with VAT rules. It acknowledged there had been problems with Chinese sellers, but said: \u201cWe have contacted hundreds of Chinese sellers to notify and educate them on the need to comply with the law.\u201d In a statement, Amazon said: \u201cWe are currently reviewing the government\u2019s proposals, and we will naturally comply with any legislation.\u201d Alongside new powers to hold Amazon and eBay liable for tax evasion by sellers, the chancellor set out plans for a new \u201cfit and proper\u201d test for warehouse operators dealing with goods shipped to the UK for sale online. Warehouses will be required to be registered by 2018. They will have to be able to show they have made checks to ensure they are not facilitating VAT fraud for online sellers based overseas. For months, VAT campaigners have been calling for the government to hold Amazon and eBay liable for VAT fraud on their websites. While the chancellor has gone some way towards meeting their demands, they were disappointed that Amazon and eBay\u2019s potential liability would be restricted to only those cases flagged by HMRC. Campaigners said it was a mistake for the chancellor to task under-resourced UK tax inspectors with hunting down VAT evaders. Amazon and eBay are awash with hundreds of small pop-up sellers, based overseas, who are unlikely to be deterred if the new measures allow HMRC to catch only a small number of offenders. In a thinly veiled attack on his Labour predecessors, summing up his tax measures Osborne said: \u201cPeople talked about social justice but left enormous loopholes in our tax system for the very richest to exploit.\u201d The chancellor said he expected the \u00a312bn total to be raised by 2020.",

However, we think ongoing structural pressures will make management inclined to continue to reinvest gross margin gains back into the proposition for some time, at the very least limiting the visibility of future margin improvement. Moreover, we are not believers in the idea that Tesco\u2019s relative scale should deliver a material margin advantage versus competitors... The main drivers to date of improved like for like growth for the Big 3 quoted grocers have been reduced net new space growth and Asda\u2019s market share losses, neither of which are likely to be continued sources of growth. Also, far from being optimistic about the potential return of inflation to UK grocery, we think there is a very real risk of it driving renewed gross margin pressure as retailers seek to gain volume by not passing through higher input costs. Even if some inflation does creep through, we think volume growth will likely fall to offset this benefit. Tesco also has the most to lose if, as we expect, Amazon puts online grocery profitability under pressure.",

                "bodyText":"Ten years ago, when Netflix was just a DVD mail-order business based in California, co-founder Reed Hastings vowed to built the \u201cleading company\u201d in the then-emerging online consumer entertainment business. Last week figures from the TV ratings body Barb showed Hastings\u2019 vision had become reality in the UK. Barb estimated that more than 5m British homes subscribed to Netflix in 2015, compared with 1.6m for rivals Amazon Prime Instant Video and fewer than 1m for Sky\u2019s internet service Now TV. That means Netflix is now in nearly a quarter of UK households, with 1.4m joining the streaming service in 2015 alone to watch hit series such as the political thriller House of Cards. Business research company IHS forecasts Netflix will have about 7.5m subscribers in the UK by 2019. With a market cap of about $42bn (\u00a329bn) and 75 million subscribers, Netflix has a presence in about 200 countries. Arguably it is the first global broadcaster, despite being an internet streaming service. Netflix\u2019s programming budget matches its global ambition and reach. In 2016, it plans to spend about $5bn on content, up from $3bn last year. Investment bank UBS estimates Netflix\u2019s UK content spend at about \u20ac360m (\u00a3283m) for this year, rising to \u20ac409m annually over the next four years. Richard Eary, the UBS head of European media equity research, says: \u201cBased on our forecasts we expect Netflix will spend more on content globally than the top seven commercial broadcasters in Europe by 2018-19.\u201d Jonathan Broughton, a IHS senior analyst for TV, television media, agrees Netflix is \u201coutspending everyone else currently on content and, if you take a global total, excluding sport, that includes Sky\u201d. Most of the content budget for on demand services such as Netflix and Amazon is spent on rights to libraries of other people\u2019s programmes, which means they have to bid for the rights in each individual market. However, the ability to aggregate the costs across many countries means it makes business sense \u2013 owing to economies of scale \u2013 to invest in scripted drama, despite its high cost. Although it began as a library of other people\u2019s shows and benefited, in particular, by marketing itself as the online home of the critically lauded US drama Breaking Bad, Netflix\u2019s decision to invest in its own original programmes took it to another level. The success of the 2013 remake of Andrew Davies\u2019 BBC adaptation of Michael Dobbs\u2019 novel House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey, became its calling card. Netflix became synonymous with the concept of binge-viewing after settling on a strategy of releasing all the episodes of its new shows at once, globally, taking the moreish habits already established with DVD box sets online. The company has \u201csurfed the zeitgeist\u201d of immersive viewing, according to Radio Times editor Ben Preston. \u201cWe\u2019re watching television in a way now that we read books \u2013 you immerse yourself in a world 20 hours at a time and the Scandinavians kick-started all that with The Killing telling the story of a murder over 20 hours with subtitles. \u201cNetflix absolutely caught on to that with House of Cards, Orange is the New Black ... They turned immersive cinema into something you could do in your own living room.\u201d The company has allied its investment in original programming with tentpole marketing, using the popularity of series such as House of Cards to promote its wider content offering. \u201cNothing is as powerful as a big hit,\u201d says Preston, \u201cand they\u2019ve had a string of shows which got people talking\u201d, the latest of which is Making a Murderer. Original programming output will rise from 450 hours last year to 600 in 2016. Netflix is reportedly splashing out about \u00a3100m on The Crown, its first UK original drama, an epic royal biopic based on Peter Morgan\u2019s play The Audience and starring Wolf Hall\u2019s Claire Foy and former Doctor Who Matt Smith. Other big names making shows for the international streaming service include Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Ricky Gervais and Charlie Brooker, whose dystopian drama Black Mirror is transferring from Channel 4. Behind the showbiz hoopla is also a sophisticated technology, commercial and marketing strategy that has helped drive the popularity of the service in the UK. Broughton says one of the reasons for Netflix\u2019s success in the UK is that culturally viewers are used to \u201cpaying quite a lot for television\u201d via providers such as Sky or Virgin, so \u201ca low price point of \u00a35.99 is extremely encouraging for them to take up an additional pay TV on the back of what they have\u201d. He adds that the BBC helped as the iPlayer \u201ctrained people\u201d in how to consume TV shows online. Good broadband penetration in the UK has also helped, plus the fact that we share the same language as the US-based Netflix. Watching Netflix also does not require a monthly contract, arguably disrupted the market \u2013 and future generations of viewers\u2019 expectations of long-term contracts \u2013 especially for Sky, which launched its own more expensive no-contract internet service Now TV in 2012. They are not completely directly comparable as Now TV offers a full TV service whereas \u201cNetflix is a VOD library\u201d, Broughton says, adding that marketing has come into play as Sky went with a fresh brand, thus \u201cprotecting their pay TV business\u201d but costing more to market from a standing start.",
