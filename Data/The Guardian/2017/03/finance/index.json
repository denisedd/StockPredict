But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. </p> <p>Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. </p> <p>Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign direct investment-focused economic model.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. </p> <p>Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances would also be negatively affected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b8073fe4b09c1763ef5648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T12:17:31.356Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer McKeown</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued.

We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their take \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Perhaps it is time to remind ourselves why Snapchat has become so big. Something to do with celebrities and selfies? And Lewis Hamilton, apparently. And here it is, Reuters are reporting (in capital letters): SNAP INC OPENS AT $24 ON NYSE VS $17 IPO PRICE The price is still edging up, it seems. This just in from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The indicative opening price for Snap Inc has edged up to $22-$24 a share. Shares in the Snapchat owner have an indicative opening price of $21-$23 a share. So that takes them more than 30% higher than the IPP price of $17 a share. Still waiting for Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price to come in. In the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging app, Snapchat: While we wait for trading in Snap to get underway, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how US markets opened: Dow Jones: -0.04% at 21,108 S&amp;P 500: -0.15% at 2,392 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,896 No new records yet... Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Evan Spiegel and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy have rung the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Excitement is building ahead of Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut trading session on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the company behind the messaging app are expected to soar after the IPO was over subscribed by more than 10 times. After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, Snap has a market value of roughly $24bn. The US President is expected to speak to the Greek prime minister in the coming days. The substance of the call, according to well-placed sources, will be Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing negotiations with creditors and the role the International Monetary Fund may or may not play in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current rescue programme. Donald Trump has publicly tweeted that he thinks the Greeks are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasting their time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd staying in the eurozone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting power, Washington has effective veto power over many decisions. The IMF has yet to sign up to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme, with Germany and the Netherlands saying its participation is vital if further emergency loans are to be disbursed to the debt-stricken country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is attaching great significance to the conversation in its bid to get a clearer picture of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on several issues, not least the Greek bailout program,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Kathimerini news paper wrote today. With tensions also rising in the Aegean between regional rivals Greece and Turkey, Athens is also placing stock in Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventionist powers, diplomats say. President Barack Obama, who chose to give his farewell speech abroad in the Greek capital, was aggressively supportive of Greece remaining in the single currency, stepping in when the country came closest yet to leaving the euro six months after Tsipras assumed power in mid-2015. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Whitehouse chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is of Greek descent, told a visiting Greek delegation ahead of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swearing-in that the new administration was determined to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix Greece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although he failed to make clear whether he meant in or out of the eurozone. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 44-year low last week, beating expectations. There were 223,000 new claims in the week ending 25 February, lower than the 243,000 predicted by economists and lower than 242,000 posted a week earlier. It was the lowest since March 1973, the US Labor Department said, and the 104th week in a row that claims were below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a healthy labour market. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, is hoping to snap up Agent Provocateur. The upmarket lingerie is expected to enter administration on Thursday with Sports Direct the favourite to buy the business out of insolvency proceedings. Sky News reported earlier this week that Ashley had gone higher than private equity firm Lion Capital in a bidding war. Agent Provocateur is owned by private equity firm 3i but the brand has struggled in recent years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00c2\u00a339m last year to reflect its problems and accounting irregularities were also uncovered. Read our full story here: A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is one of the biggest threats facing the Irish economy according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service. Another is the prospect of US corporate tax reforms. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stresses however that Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects remain strong. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior vice president and author of the report explains on the risks posed by Brexit: Ireland has been growing strongly since 2014 and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming years. But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential. And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform: There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign direct investment-focused economic model. The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances would also be negatively affected. Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. The pick-up entirely reflected higher energy and food inflation while the core rate was unchanged at just 0.9%. Florian Hense, economist at the German bank Berenberg, agrees, and suggests the European Central Bank will not feel the need to tighten policy at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: The ECB will not have to rethink the thrust of its policies. The ECB will be very cautious not to make the same mistake it did in 2011 when it ended up hiking rates in April and July, just a few months before the Euro crisis erupted. Would you be happy to travel in a driverless car? The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gwyn Topham took a spin around East London in a self-driving electric Nissan Leaf. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened: And the story in full: Moving over to Greece now, where the main opposition leader says the government is deliberately drawing out negotiations with creditors and preparing the country for a fourth bailout. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Seven years after it was granted its first emergency loan programme, Greece is being prepared for a fourth bailout, says Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who heads the main opposition centre right New Democracy party. In a wide ranging interview aired on Ant 1 TV on Wednesday night, the politician said prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acceptance of further pension cuts and tax reforms was tantamount to a new adjustment programme that New Democracy would not be backing. This government cannot get the country out of the impasse it is in. We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor. Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago. The government is consciously delaying [it] for reasons of domestic consumption. There is a big danger that entry into the [ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] quantitative easing [programme] will be missed. The spectre of yet more cuts has caused rising alarm in Greece with pensioners taking to the streets. It comes as the Cologne Institute for Economic research says poverty in Greece has shot up by 40 % between 2008 and 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is the big loser,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the think tank said in its latest study on the European economy, pointing out that the increase was the biggest among EU member states. President Trump is awake and tweeting about his impact on markets: The weak spots in the construction PMI survey have helped to push the pound to a six-week low against the dollar. Sterling fell 0.25% to $1.2259 against a broadly stronger dollar. It also hit a two-week low against the euro, with one euro worth 85.90p. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said the outlook for the pound was very much dependent on how quickly Theresa May can push ahead with Brexit plans. If she can trigger Brexit as per her deadline, it may push sterling even lower as this will send the message that Theresa May is in full control and her hard Brexit is taking shape. On the flip side, if she cannot deliver this on time, this could be a positive thing for sterling, and the currency could rally all the way to $1.28, with a potential target of $1.30 a realistic target as well. Earlier the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI suggested activity in the sector grew in February at a similar pace to January. The headline index edged up to 52.5 from 52.2, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Civil engineers reported an acceleration in growth, while growth in housing construction slowed slightly. Construction of commercial buildings such as offices and shops slowed. Firms were fairly upbeat according to Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, but there were reports of weakening demand: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey data highlights that the UK construction sector has rebounded from its post- referendum soft patch but remains on a relatively slow growth trajectory. Weaker momentum in the house building sector was a key factor weighing on construction growth, alongside a renewed fall in work commercial projects. There was little sign that the UK storms had a material impact on construction growth in February, although some firms noted that longer delivery times for roof tiles had added to supply chain issues. Instead, survey respondents mainly cited an underlying slowdown in sales growth, with the latest rise in new work the weakest for four months. Cost pressures in the sector remained at an eight-and-a-half year high, as the sharp drop in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of materials and goods imported from abroad. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.6% - the lowest since May 2009. There were 15.2 million unemployed people in the region, down 56,000 compared with December. Greece has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone at 23%, while Germany has the lowest at 3.8%. Youth unemployment also fell in January, by 198,000 compared with a year earlier to 2.8 million. The youth unemployment rate remains high at 20%. The highest rate is 45.7% in Greece, and the lowest is 6.5% in Germany. The headline rate of inflation in the eurozone rose to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, bang in line with expectations. Eurostat, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office, said energy prices, food, alcohol and tobacco were the main drivers of the rise. Shares in the outsourcing group Capita are down 9% after the company revealed a 33% fall in annual profits and said its chief executive Andy Parker was stepping down. It follows confirmation that the company, which operates the London congestion charge, is to be relegated from the FTSE 100 because of a sharp fall in the share price. Parker commented on his departure: 2016 has been a difficult year for Capita but the Company is now a simpler, more focussed group with a clear service offering and growth strategy, and a plan to achieve a stronger balance sheet. We have achieved a great deal but going forward it is time for a new leader to take Capita through the next steps to renewed and sustainable organic growth. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling nostalgic following the news that the Football Pools is being sold for \u00c2\u00a383m, below is a potted history of the former British staple. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, the pools had 15 million regular punters, helped by an army of door-to-door coupon collectors. The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime, is about to change hands in an \u00c2\u00a383m deal. Its owner, London-listed betting company Sportech, has agreed to sell the football lottery game to a company controlled by funds advised by European private equity investors OpCapita. The conditional sale agreement comes after a near-\u00c2\u00a3100m sale of the Football Pools to its management team fell through in November. The Football Pools dates back to 1923 and has struggled against the National Lottery, but is still popular with about 300,000 stalwarts who spend an average of just over \u00c2\u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum price of \u00c2\u00a33m. The business was formed from the merger of the three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters between 2000 and 2007. The pools will still move into new premises in Liverpool city centre. John Von Spreckelsen, chairman of OpCapita: We are delighted to be acquiring the Football Pools, which occupies a unique place in British culture. Sportech has successfully modernised the business and we look forward to realising its significant growth potential. As part of that growth strategy, we plan to ensure existing loyal customers continue to enjoy the game and bring the Football Pools, already loved by so many, to an even wider audience. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst, at ETX Capital, says Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut in New York coincides with a period of bullishness among investors: Snap shares look set to fly when they begin trading in New York today after being priced at $17, above its target range. With the Dow closing above 21,000 for the first time the IPO comes at an incredibly bullish point for US, and indeed global, equities. Of course such bullishness is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble and this could be a high watermark for the market. The offer was 10 times over-subscribed, making a strong case for the stock to pop on the open. Big institutional funds will step in to the main market to add to their holdings, forcing up the price. Lessons to be learned from Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen huge retail client interest in Snap shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is as big as the Facebook IPO in terms of the hype and buzz around it. But trading in Snap shares could be choppy today. It could be pricing high and selling low. Facebook again is instructive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it endured a rocky start to life on the public markets, sliding from its IPO price before turning things around. Of course its IPO was beset by technical problems that the US exchanges are keen to avoid this time. There is also a sense that the shares could be overpriced, based on some key fundamentals. Shares in Snap, the American technology company behind the messaging app Snapchat, will start trading in New York today. Shares are expected to soar after it raised $3.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.9bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, above its price expectations. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO was over-subscribed by more than 10 times, suggesting demand for shares will be strong when trading gets underway. Reuters notes: After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, the owner of the popular disappearing-message app has a market value of roughly $24 billion, more than double the size of rival Twitter Inc and the richest valuation in a US tech IPO since Facebook five years ago. The share sale was the first test of investor appetite for a social-media app that is beloved by teenagers and people under 30 for applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies, but has yet to convert \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into cash. The FTSE 100 might only be up 4 points or 0.1% at 7,387 but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new record high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are on a high following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending pledges despite the fact the President has yet to provide any detail. Equities analysts and strategists including myself have been arguing for some time that if no further details were provided on how and when the proposed US tax reforms and spending plans will take place, the market rally should take a pause. However, US President Donald Trump provided no new details in his speech to Congress on Tuesday, and yet, stocks surged to new highs. He also points out that rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month are also driving shares higher... usually such expectations would have the opposite effect as investors remain hooked on stimulus as the hangover from the financial crisis persists. Sayed says: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more interesting is markets now consider a tighter monetary policy a sign of confidence in economic growth and thus a reason to continue purchasing stocks, when for years post 2008 crisis it had been considered the most significant motive to dump stocks. Does the market rally have legs? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that improved economic conditions, consumer confidence, and higher inflation will all lead to higher earnings growth, but what markets are currently pricing in is more than just these factors. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly about tax reforms, and assuming a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax from 35% to 20%, although difficult to calculate its impact on earnings, is expected to lift net profits from 10% to 15%, and this is what investors are betting on. If you still want to ride the current bullish momentum wave, pray that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reduction plan succeeds as soon as possible. The spotlight is on key elections coming up in Europe and all bets are off following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock Brexit vote and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to install Donald Trump in the White House. Could the Netherlands deliver the next surprise? Here is a useful guide to the Dutch elections on 15 March: As markets settle following a record-breaking run, investors await the flash eurozone inflation rate for February, to be published at 10am. If economists polled by Reuters get it right, and the headline rate rises to 2% from 1.8% in January, Mario Draghi is likely to come under renewed pressure over the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Specifically, pressure could build on the president of the ECB to announce policy tightening at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the governing council. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the figure and reaction when it comes. The FTSE 100 is up slightly this morning, rising 0.1% or four points to 7,387. Elsewhere in Europe major markets are up with the exception of Spain. German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.03% at 12,071 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 4,9781 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.01% at 19,367 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.04% at 9,748 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 376 The FTSE 250, which is more domestically focused on the UK than the FTSE 100, is down 0.1% at 18,961. Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning today. In a pretty gloomy report on poverty, inequality, and living standards, the thinktank says household incomes will not grow at all over the next two years. On average, by 2021-22, families will be \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year worse off than they might have reasonably expected back in 2007-08 before the financial crisis took hold. Inequality and child poverty are also expected to rise over the next five years as a direct result of government policies. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at IFS, explains: Weak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts means that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 as it was back in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08. In the decade before that, it fell by a third. Tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament explain all of the projected increase in absolute child poverty between 2014\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 and 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22. A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the report: We are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the National Living Wage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this Parliament. Here is our full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to go on a major spending spree drove a surge in investor optimism, pushing indices on both sides of the Atlantic to fresh record highs on Wednesday. Asia followed Wall Street higher this morning with the Hang Seng and Nikkei both just about in positive territory. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson has this take on investor mood: Records tumbled one after the other yesterday as equity markets across the world went on a tear in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to spend up to $1trn on rebuilding the infrastructure of the United States, with the FTSE100 and FTSE250 both making an closing at new record highs, as the reflation trade took another leg higher. US markets also surged with the Dow opening above 21,000 and the S&amp;P500 also hitting new record highs above 2,400, as markets posted their best one day gain of 2017. Also coming up day we have the flash estimate of eurozone inflation which is expected to show a pick up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, potentially causing problems for Mario Draghi. We also have eurozone unemployment. In the UK we have the latest snapshot of construction from the PMI survey for February. And over in the US we have weekly jobless claims figures. We will be bringing you all the latest developments as the day unfolds.",

Among other things, short-covering was the reason behind the slightly firmer oil prices then. Brent and WTI started Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session on the front foot.</p> <p>However, they turned lower again by mid-morning before going into a mini free fall by midday. The latest drop was apparently in response to the OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly oil report. While the OPEC acknowledged that compliance with the supply adjustments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers supported prices and it raised its global oil demand forecast for 2017, it also raised its estimates for oil production from outside of the cartel. In the US, shale producers have ramped up drilling activity and increased oil output in response to higher prices.

Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost certain we will see an increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve tomorrow.

                "bodyText":"Worries about Brexit, as well as a second Scottish referendum, sent the pound to an eight week low of $1.2106 against the dollar. The US currency was also boosted by the prospect of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. But sterling has since recovered from its lows, although it is still down 0.47% at $1.2160. Against the euro, the pound has fallen 0.29% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1435 having earlier been as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1382. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Despite the fact that the pound is hugely undervalued by historical standards, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK means we find little to be bullish about for the pound as we face confrontational negotiations. One could be excused for feeling we have had quite enough referendums over the past year, yet with Scotland seeking a second vote, there are plenty of reasons to question what the UK will look like in just over two years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. On that note, it is time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A fall in the oil price, uncertainty over Brexit and a second Scottish referendum along with some caution ahead of an expected US interest rate rise on Wednesday and the Dutch election left equity markets in Europe lower on the day. Commodity companies came under pressure on the back of the drop in crude prices, while banks were also unwanted. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were particularly weak on the renewed concerns about Scottish independence. The French market dropped back on the latest twist in the presidential campaign while Italy and Spain also struggled. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.13% or 9.23 points at 7357.85 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.01% to 11,988.79 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.51% lower at 4974.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.86% to 19,537.40 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.91% at 9905.1 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.89% to 638.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 41 points or 0.2%. A second Scottish referendum which lead to a vote for independence would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a negative credit shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK economy and public finances, and could lead to a rating downgrade, according to a new report by Fitch. The agency, which has a AA rating with a negative outlook on the UK, said: We believe Scottish independence would have adverse effects on the UK public finances and economy and so would be credit negative for the UK, as we have previously stated. Key uncertainties include the impact on the future trade relationship between the two countries, the financial sector and Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency arrangements. Scottish independence would lead to an increase in the ratio of UK government debt to GDP. The UK government stated ahead of the September 2014 referendum that it would in all circumstances honour its issued stock of UK debt if Scotland voted for independence. This would lead to a one-off increase of around 8% of GDP in the UK gross public debt ratio as Scotland dropped out of UK GDP, on the basis of latest estimates of UK and Scottish GDP. At the same time, we would assume that Scotland would be responsible for a proportionate share of existing public debt in the form of a long-term bilateral loan, giving the UK an off-setting claim on Scotland. This UK asset would be taken into account in our judgement of the overall position and sustainability of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. We recognise that a wide range of outcomes from Brexit is possible and we will continue to assess the UK sovereign rating as developments unfold. The Negative Outlook on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign rating reflects the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote and the long-term challenge for the UK to reduce public debt. Ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Baden-Baden, the International Monetary Fund has called on the major economies to preserve the benefits of trade and avoid protectionism. With US president Trump showing protectionist tendencies and a propensity to rip up trade agreements, the IMF called for countries with trade and current account surpluses to work with countries with deficits to reduce these imbalances. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the global economy was improving but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it would be a mistake to assume that it will automatically return to rude health.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added: In fact, there has rarely been a period when policy choices have mattered more for what comes next, especially since there are still considerable risks to the outlook... Above all, we should collectively avoid self-inflicted injuries. This requires steering clear of policies that would seriously undermine trade, migration, capital flows, and the sharing of technologies across borders. Such measures would hurt the productivity, incomes, and living standards of all citizens. European markets have edged back from their lows and are now virtually unchanged, with the exception of France. The FTSE 100 is down just 0.08%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.02%. But France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.49% as the rightwing French presidential candidate Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Fillon was been placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds. See our full report here: Worries about a new Scottish referendum appear to be at least part of the reason for a slump in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. RBS, down around 3% at the moment, and Lloyds, nearly 2% lower, both said they would relocate to England if the Scots voted for independence at the last referendum in 2014. Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood told Reuters: [They] both have sizeable Scottish operations, so it depends what...ultimately happens there and whether [Scotland] actually exits the UK and stays part of Europe. Back with oil, and the price is continuing to slide. Brent crude is now down 1.7% at $50.47 while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2% to $47.40 after Saudi Arabia pumped more oil than expected in February. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: After a significant drop last week, oil prices tried to stabilise themselves at the start of this week as both contracts ended Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session slightly higher. Among other things, short-covering was the reason behind the slightly firmer oil prices then. Brent and WTI started Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session on the front foot. However, they turned lower again by mid-morning before going into a mini free fall by midday. The latest drop was apparently in response to the OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly oil report. While the OPEC acknowledged that compliance with the supply adjustments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers supported prices and it raised its global oil demand forecast for 2017, it also raised its estimates for oil production from outside of the cartel. In the US, shale producers have ramped up drilling activity and increased oil output in response to higher prices. This has put serious question marks over the OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to balance the oil market. The bad weather in New York seems unlikely to hold back the Federal Reserve from raising US interest rates at the end of its two day meeting. Defying the elements, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest gathering has apparently begun: And most analysts do indeed now expect an increase in borrowing costs following the recent strong economic data. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost certain we will see an increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve tomorrow. The question now is not if they will increase, but by how much. The US economy added 235,000 jobs in February from non-farm payroll data, confirming a positive outlook for the US economy. Additionally, Wall Street is up 5% since the beginning of 2017 which is an impressive performance by any measure. There is much discussion about whether this uptrend can continue with the possibility of the highest interest rates since 2007...We have a generation of investors who have become accustomed to investments trends with the back drop of an extremely accommodative monetary policy from the FED. Going forward, with possible three rate increases for 2017 alone, I predict we will see trepidation for the equity markets in general. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, agreed a rate rise was pretty much set in stone: Markets have fully priced the outcome, Fed speakers have shouted it from the rooftops and the aforementioned job figures confirm the continuation of American economic vibrancy. Because this is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fed meeting, with press conference and updated projections, there will be plenty of opportunities for the Fed to signal if it still believes three total tightening efforts are still appropriate for 2017, with another three scheduled for 2018. There is a risk that they upgrade this plan given economic strength. But our suspicion is that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, as the market already has a lot to digest given the sudden uptick in the pace of tightening from once per year to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once per quarter. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth projections should inch a little higher, though the extreme uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal policy suggests that any such movement should be tentative. The US stock market has opened cautiously, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 index both dropping by around 0.2%. Energy stocks are down, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in the oil price. Financial stocks are also in the red, while consumer-focused shares are up. Traders face a struggle to get to their desks today, due to the snow that has hit New York, and beyond. Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts a quiet day on Wall Street.... US markets could well feel the effect of the blizzard that has descended on New York in the past few hours. We could be in for a volume-light session, compounding the probability of another snooze-fest for US markets ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed decision. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Charlotte Hogg did the right thing by resigning -- and believes the Bank of England has lessons to learn over the affair. Hogg has done the right thing in resigning quickly. Better that than a long, drawn-out process that would eventually have ended with the same result. She was damaged goods. This incident shows that the system of oversight by the Treasury committee has worked. The grilling of Anthony Habgood, chairman of the Bank of England court, was forensic and showed MPs at their best. As the report noted, Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure raises wider concerns. The fact that Habgood had no inkling of Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to disclose her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job suggests the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance is not all it should have been. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the whole affair is that Habgood seemed to assume that because Hogg was an all-round good egg from a distinguished family he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to ask too many questions. While the pound dips, the US dollar is strengthening as investors anticipate the first US interest rate rise of 2017 tomorrow afternoon. Even the snow hitting the east cost of America isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to prevent the US Federal Reserve hiking borrowing costs, in response to the latest solid economic data. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial resilience to Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that she will push for a second vote on Scottish independence dwindled in early morning trade today, with sterling slipping to 8-week lows against the US dollar near the $1.21 mark. News that any new referendum won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen until late next year at the earliest may have softened the initial impact, but the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming political challenges are still driving sentiment with reports suggesting Theresa May will trigger Article 50 in the final week of March after getting the green light to initiate formal Brexit proceedings from Parliament last night. Meanwhile, expectations that the Fed will lift US interest rates tomorrow and prime markets for more to follow later in the year are also lending support to the dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price has taken another slide today, after Saudi Arabia revealed that it boosted production levels last month. New figures supplied to the Opec cartel show that Saudi pumped more than 10 million barrels per day in February. That means it has reversed some of the curbs it promised last November, when Opec agreed a historic deal to cut production. The news has knocked 1% off the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil, which has dropped to $50.85 per barrel for the first time in four months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation: Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure is a big blow to efforts to get more women into top jobs at the Bank of England. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Ward points out that men have dominated the monetary policy committee since it was created almost 20 years ago: The previous deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, is moving to run the London School of Economics, while professor Kristen Forbes is leaving the MPC in June when her first term expires. Having helped to prompt the end of Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career at the Bank of England, Andrew Tyrie MP has now welcomed her resignation. In a statement, the chair of the Treasury committee says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a regrettable business with no winners. Ms Hogg has acted in the best interest of the institution for which she has been working. This is welcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also welcome that the Bank has responded immediately by announcing an internal review. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance is already in much better shape than it was a few years ago. It is something to which the Governor and Court has been committed for some time. But there is clearly more to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee will be examining the conclusions of this work in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As well as criticising Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competence, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the Treasury committee didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the rest of the BoE in any glory. This exchange with BoE court chairman Anthony Habgood, during last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, was particularly excruciating: The financial markets have known for nine months that Britain was going to trigger the process of leaving the EU. But it seems that Brexit may not be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. George Saravelos, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank, believes that sterling could fall much further, and close to parity with the US dollar: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the market is slowly starting to realise that Brexit is anything but priced in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How can you price in an event of incredible complexity that has never happened before? We remain very bearish on the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201d our forecast is for a move close to $1.05.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the FT... Speaking of Brexit, one of the major groups in the European Parliament has backed a petition calling for UK citizens to be allowed to retain their EU citizenship rights after the break-up. ALDE is the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, led by former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, and has warned that any Brexit deal could be voted down unless EU citizens in Britain get the right to remain. Back in the markets, the pound is still bobbing around an eight-week low as traders worry about Brexit, and a possible second vote on Scottish independence. Sterling is down almost one cent right now, at $1.2127. Against the euro, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost over half a eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.141. Theresa May is due to update parliament about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Council summit later today; a chance for MPs to express their views and concerns about Brexit. So far today, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has voiced his disappointment that article 50 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being triggered today, while the UK government has warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the EU. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic call for a new vote on Scottish independence is a serious complication to the Brexit story, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. The complex issue of Brexit has been further affected by the additional twist of the call for a second Scottish Independence Referendum. The previous Scottish Referendum was supposed to have settled the issue for a generation but the SNP now claims that Brexit decision has changed this, as 62% of Scots voted to remain in the EU. This complicates the task facing the UK government as they have won parliamentary authority to trigger Article 50, to initiate the process for pulling out of the EU. Further to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments, the pound has now slumped into a two month low, at $1.2125. The lower pound is proving to be good for UK exports but inflation which is already showing signs of a significant revival could be boosted further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On a lighter note, gin and bicycle helmets are being included in the basket of goods used to track UK inflation. Both items were dropped over a decade ago, but have been brought back to reflect changing consumer habits. The Office for National Statistics says that: Gin consumption [is] on the rise, partly thanks to the significant growth in the number of small gin producers. Bicycle helmets are also returning to the basket after a 12-year absence, following the significant increase in the popularity of cycling due to sporting successes by British cyclists in the Olympics and the Tour De France. The ONS has also added \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no dairy milk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items, such as soya, rice and oat milk; these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free From\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items have all risen in popularity in recent years. Basic mobile phone handsets have been dropped from the basket. In another tweak, the stats body has stopped tracking the price of child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swings, and replaced them with child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scooters. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another attempt to better measure what parents spend money on: The number of price quotes collected for the swing has been falling reflecting its availability in shops particularly in the winter months and the change is an attempt to improve coverage of outdoor play equipment particularly in those winter months. More details here: Consumer price inflation basket of goods and services: 2017 Oh wow. Charlotte Hogg actually offered to resign last week, when she also admitted to MPs that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed to report her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays. The Bank has just published Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation letter, in which she insists she made an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honest mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by not fully complying with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct (which she helped to draw up). She also reiterates that she never shared any information with her brother , but recognises that saying sorry isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the letter, dated yesterday (suggesting she resigned last night, after MPs met to discuss the issue before drawing up this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report). Labour MP Angela Eagle says Hogg has made the right decision: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, from the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor Kamal Ahmed: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our political editor Heather Stewart: NEWSFLASH: Charlotte Hogg has resigned from the Bank of England, following the scathing report from the Treasury committee. In a statement, the BoE says it accepted her resignation with deep regret. Anthony Habgood, Chair of Court, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In her time at the Bank, Charlotte Hogg has made a huge contribution in areas such as professionalising and modernising the management and operations of the Bank, leading the implementation of the strategic plan, championing diversity and driving forward the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of key issues such as Fintech and Operational Risk. No one who knows her doubts her track record or her integrity. While Charlotte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by any measure exceeds the standard that would be expected in the private sector or would be required under statute, it is understandable in the circumstances and she has taken it with the best interests of the Bank at heart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank, says he also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply regrets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd her decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I fully respect her decision taken in accordance with her view of what was the best for this institution, I deeply regret that Charlotte Hogg has chosen to resign from the Bank of England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since Charlotte joined the Bank almost four years ago, she has transformed its management and operations. Drawing on her extensive private sector experience and her unrelenting commitment to excellence, she has led a broad range of initiatives to build a more open and inclusive institution, to overhaul our IT systems, and to change fundamentally how the Bank develops, manages and rewards its dedicated public servants. Along the way, she has inspired countless colleagues at the Bank and attracted a new cohort of professionals to it. The combination of Charlotte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique skills and drive were exceptionally well suited to lead similar transformations of our markets and banking responsibilities, particularly given the growing importance of FinTech, operational excellence and the management of cyber risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlotte Hogg is under serious pressure now, following the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that she lacks the competence to be deputy governor. Wes Streeting, another member of the committee, says she should step down. Newsflash: The Treasury Committee has just declared that Charlotte Hogg, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, has fallen short of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighest standards\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 required for the role. In a new report, MPs have criticised Hogg for not reporting that her brother Quintin works for Barclays, when she joined the Bank in 2013 as chief operating officer. Hogg only revealed this breach of the code of conduct last week, having initially told the committee that she had reported all possible conflicts of interest. And the Treasury Committee has now concluded that this means Hogg is not up to the job of deputy governor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very serious rebuke. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key conclusion from its report: In its Report on 2 March, the Committee concluded that Ms Hogg had the professional competence necessary to fulfil the role of Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. Had it known then what has since been disclosed, it would have taken a different view. Professional competence for this role includes an ability to follow the rules, particularly those that one has had a hand in writing and enforcing; an understanding of why those rules are important; and an awareness of the risks arising from actual and potential conflicts of interest, and the perceptions of conflict. Ms Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oral and written evidence has given the Committee grounds for concern on all three counts. The Committee considers that her professional competence falls short of the very high standards required to fulfil the additional responsibilities of Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. John Mann MP, a member of the committee, says this is its strongest ever ruling. The British Chambers of Commerce has added to the jitters in the City this morning. Although the BCC has raised its growth forecast for 2017, it also cut its forecasts for 2018 and predicted that consumer spending will falter as inflation rises. More here: Foreign exchange traders are starting to get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spooked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the prospect of two years of Brexit negotiations, warns Kathleen Brooks of City Index. Parliament may have passed the Brexit Bill, but a source at the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said that Article 50 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be triggered today, instead we will have to wait until the end of March, when Dutch elections and the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 60th birthday celebrations are out of the way. The pound has taken a sharp drop in early Tuesday trading, in fairness liquidity has been thin, however, it suggests that the reality of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divorce from Europe and two years of horse-trading to agree trade deals is beginning to spook the FX market. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sterling has dropped like a rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this morning, as traders wake up to the reality that the UK will trigger article 50 this month. Theresa May is heading towards hard Brexit negotiations with an attitude that she has nothing to lose. The biggest fear on the street is what will her EU partners will say and how they are going to treat this matter given that Brexit is about to become a reality. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index, which contains many medium-sized UK companies, hit a fresh all-time high in early trading. A cheaper pound boosts the value of UK companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overseas earnings, and also makes them more vulnerable to takeover bids from foreign rivals. Financial experts believe that Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for a new referendum on independence is also hitting the pound today. Theresa May tried to slap down the idea yesterday, claiming the Scottish Government was playing politics by requesting a second vote. But the City is concerned that the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is also in doubt, as the PM starts the devilishly complicated task of exiting the EU. Investors must consider whether the vote will happen, whether it will be before or after Brexit, and what the result might be. Carsten Nickel of Teneo Intelligence says: The many questions surrounding the latest Scottish push for independence will further add to the already elevated levels of uncertainty. The coming days will likely see both pro- and anti-independence activists starting to work with strong assumptions about the consequences of a potential Scottish break-away, painting their positive or negative views as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inevitable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on calls for a second Scottish referendum is still evolving, but reports in the media overnight (The Times) suggest PM May is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preparing to reject\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the call. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that the prospect of a second Scottish independence vote is pushing sterling down this morning. The prospect of Britain triggering its exit from the European Union this month has hit sterling this morning. The pound has shed almost a cent against the US dollar in early trading, hitting $1.2125. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lowest point since mid-January, when Theresa May declared that Britain would leave the single market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 19% weaker than before last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. The pound is also down around 0.6% against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.140. Traders appear to be responding to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments in Westminster, where MPs gave their approval to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit bill. That gives the prime minister the power to formally trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and ends the tussle between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Lords had pushed, in vain, for the government to grant residency rights to EU nationals and guarantee MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader in the Lords, Lady Smith, told the Guardian that the Upper House realised there was no hope of changing MPs minds over this issue. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I thought there was a foot in the door or a glimmer of hope that we could change this bill, I would fight it tooth and nail, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case. Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be formally triggered today, but the government is adamant it will happen by the end of the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting today, where policymakers are widely expected to raise borrowing costs for the first time this year. The Federal Reserve meeting is taking place in a chilly New York, as a blizzard strikes the North East of America. That may prevent some Wall Street traders getting to work, but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent the Fed taking its decisions or holding a press conference tomorrow night. Investors will be keen to see how hawkish Fed chair Janet Yellen sounds, for clues on how many interest rates may come this year. In the UK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out which products have been added to the basket of goods used to calculate inflation, and which have been turfed out. The ONS will reveal all at 9.30am GMT. In Europe, the Dutch election race is reaching a climax. Voters head to the polls tomorrow, after watching prime minister Mark Rutte and far-right populist Geert Wilders clash in a TV debate last night. The escalating row between the Netherlands and Turkey, following a ban on Turkish ministers campaigning in the country, has added an extra level of tension and drama and put migration firmly in the spotlight (just where Wilders wants it). And in the City, online supermarket chain Ocado and copper producer Antofagasta are reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has set a new closing high. Relief over the Dutch election result, and the dovish comments from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve last night, drove shares higher in London today. The news of a split at the Bank of England over interest rates didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spoil the party either. So the Footsie ended the day up 47 points at 7415, beating the previous closing high of 7382 set on March 1st. Mining stocks led the risers, showing optimism for global growth. The pound is also up today -- trading 0.75 of a cent higher at $1.236. That pulled the FTSE 100 back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday high of 7,444 points (set before the Bank of England revealed that policymaker Kristin Forbes had voted to raise interest rates). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Though Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the BoE will be raising rates anytime soon, especially since she leaves the institution in June, with inflation creeping ever higher it does perhaps nudge the MPC closer to a hawkish position. The pound certainly thought so, at least, rising half a percent against the dollar to a 2 week high having been in the red by the same amount earlier in the day after the Queen gave her Royal Assent for the triggering of Article 50. Other European markets have also romped ahead, helping the Stoxx 600 index to close 0.6% higher. The Amsterdam market closed at its highest level since December 2007. The AEX index finished 0.4% higher tonight as traders digested the news that prime minister Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VVD party had beaten far-right Geert Wilders to first place in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Steve Ruffley, chief market strategist at InterTrader, points out that the markets have defied predictions of sharp losses if Britain voted to leave the EU, or if Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Nine months ago, we were warned that Brexit may knock the markets by 10%, if Trump became president maybe they may fall 20%, yet here we stand at record levels. The explanation for this is easy. The world has gone mad. Last night we saw the Fed finally start the path of normalisation on rate with a hike. Predicted to be 1 of 4 but most likely 3. In traditional economic models hikes in rates send markets down. Not in the new exciting world of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno news is bad news for stocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. On the serious side investors, with a lack of alternatives (interest on cash) have forgotten stocks are a risky investment. What goes up will come down. Ruffley added that 7,500 points is the new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpsychological testing point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the FTSE 100, suggesting it will continue to rise. Selling new highs is not the strategy in this new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstocks at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrapping up for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. See you tomorrow. GW With 30 minutes to go, the FTSE 100 is on track to end the day at a new closing high. The jump in the pound at noon today, when the Bank of England interest rate decision hit the wires, has pulled down share prices a little. The blue-chip index is currently up 37 points at 7,406. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday high of 7,444 points, but still above the previous record close. Greek counter-terrorism officials are investigating whether the letter bomb sent to the IMF was dispatched from a post office in the Greek capital, insiders say. One tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All post offices have been ordered to go back through their files,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The blast occurred a day after the Greek urban guerrilla group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb sent to the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble on Wednesday. The suspicious parcel laced with the sort of explosive used in fireworks was intercepted by German authorities before it reached its recipient. A message posted on the Indymedia Athens anarchist site says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We take responsibility for sending the booby trapped parcel to the Germany finance minister.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek intelligence officials are working on the assumption that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast may have been orchestrated by the same group. Greek anarchist groups have recently racheted up criticism of the demands made of Greece by the IMF. Security is tight outside the IMF offices near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris this afternoon, as police investigate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exploding letter. Over in New York, animal rights campaigners are protesting outside the stock exchange. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unhappy that Canada Goose, the retail chain that uses fur on some of its winter coats, has floated on the stock exchange today. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather less action inside the stock exchange, though. After jumping last night, the Dow Jones index is becalmed this morning, down just 0.07%. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has confirmed that one of her colleagues was injured in an explosion at its Paris offices (seemingly caused by a letter bomb). She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been informed about the explosion in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris office, which caused injuries to one of our staff. I have been in touch with the office, and my compassion goes to the colleagues there. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate. We are working closely with the French authorities to investigate this incident and ensure the safety of our staff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Adam Chester, head of economics at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, points out traders now expect the first UK interest rate rise to come a little sooner than before: Early reaction has seen the pound and UK government bond yields spike higher. The pound has rallied back above $1.2350 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.15, and 10-year government bond yields have risen around 7bp to 1.26%. In the money markets, expectations are now fully priced to a rise in UK interest rates by the end of 2018, compared with early 2019 before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split, City economists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect UK interest rates to rise anytime soon. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, points out that Kristin Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term on the MPC soon expires: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As expected, the Bank of England have left policy unchanged. GDP growth in the first quarter looks to have been close to their forecast, with some signs of a slowdown in household spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A reduction in the equilibrium unemployment rate, supported by a softening in wage pressures in the latest Labour Market Report, suggests interest rates will remain on hold for now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dissenting vote by Kristin Forbes will have come as a surprise to some, although she is a well-known hawk on the committee, who will be leaving this summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warns savers to expect little help from the BoE: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Bank of England is showing no signs of blinking in the course it has charted for monetary policy. Inflation may be starting to rise, but interest rates are staying put for the foreseeable future, which is going to cause further pain for cash savers. Households face a currency crunch this year, as weaker sterling feeds through into consumer prices, pushing up the cost of living, while pay growth still looks anaemic. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says a rate hike would have hurt struggling families: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest freeze is no surprise, the Bank of England won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t budge on interest rates for a while yet. With our world thrown into uncertainty by Brexit, wage growth stalling and inflation creeping up they need to tread carefully even with the drop in unemployment. A rate rise today would have put extra pressure on household finances and queued up trouble by stopping stretched households spending at a time when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important they continue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kallum Pickering of Berenberg predicts that interest rates will stay on hold for at least another year: As our base case, we look for a 25bp first rate hike in the second quarter of 2018, with a 30% chance the BoE raises the bank rate earlier.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the first hike, the BoE will likely continue to proceed with extra caution, with small and infrequent rate hikes signalled far in advance, and with a strong bias toward remaining in neutral as and when risks to growth surface. The pound has hit a two-week high, on the back of the split at the Bank of England. Sterling jumped nearly a cent when the results of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting hit the wires, to $1.235 for the first time since 28 February. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Professor Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to push for a rate hike has driven the pound up. Like the Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England decided to keep its monetary policy unchanged. BUT it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a unanimous decision as Kristin Forbes voted for a 25 basis point rise amid concerns over inflation. This caused the pound to jump across the board. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes show that eight members of the MPC voted to leave interest rates on hold because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the UK economy is strong enough to stomach a rate hike. Pay growth had remained subdued, consistent with the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that some slack remained in the labour market, and there had been some signs that the squeeze in households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real income growth was feeding through into spending, as expected. In this context, the conditioning assumption that had underpinned the February projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that there would be some modest withdrawal of monetary stimulus over the course of the forecast period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remained appropriate. The potential for uncertainty over future trading arrangements to affect materially economic decision making remained, posing a downside risk to the activity outlook, to which the Committee could respond if necessary. On the other hand, with inflation rising sharply, and only mixed evidence on slowing activity domestically, some members noted that it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted. But they also show that Kristin Forbes is rather concerned about inflation; with unemployment at a joint 42-year low, she argued that a rate hike was justified. For one member, the monetary policy trade-off had evolved to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate. Inflation was rising quickly and was likely to remain above target for at least three years. Measures of domestically generated inflation had also increased notably and, combined with global reflation and minimal labour market slack, posed upside risks to inflation. On the other side of the trade-off, the weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised. Unemployment showed no signs of increasing. Although consumer spending appeared to be softening, as expected, growth was likely to be supported by other components of demand, such as net exports. Therefore, for this member, there was less justification for tolerating inflation above the target for an extended period, although monetary policy should remain nimble. The Bank of England has warned that inflation is likely to smash over its target this summer, partly thanks to higher energy bills. The minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting show that policymakers are bracing for the consumer prices index to hit its 2% soon (possibly even next week), and keep rising. The BoE says: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 1.8% in January, fractionally below Bank staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation at the time of the February Inflation Report, in part owing to weaker clothing and footwear prices, which were typically volatile. Since the time of the previous Report, a number of domestic utility providers had announced increases in gas and electricity prices that were somewhat in excess of the baseline assumptions factored into the February forecast. The net result of the news in the January CPI outturn, recent utility price announcements, and the decline in the sterling oil price was to leave the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation for CPI inflation broadly similar to the February projection. CPI inflation was expected to rise to around the 2% target over the next month or so, and, given the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation, to exceed the target materially by the summer. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction from City experts: Kristen Forbes is the first MPC member to vote to raise UK interest rates in over a year. The previous lone hawk was Ian McCafferty in January 2016. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that Forbes leaves the BoE in June - so she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have many more opportunities to vote for a hike. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen writes: The Bank of England has held interest rates at their record low but its policy committee was split on the decision with one member, Kristin Forbes, voting to raise borrowing costs immediately. Eight members of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee (MPC) felt that the current 0.25% base rate and electronic money-printing programme were appropriate to support the post-referendum economy amid signs that slower pay growth and rising inflation was dampening consumer spending. But Forbes, who leaves the committee at the end of June, felt inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was rising quickly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and was likely to remain above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.0% target for at least three years. Minutes from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting showed Forbes also felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showed no signs of increasing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As such, she voted against the rest of the committee and advocated an increase in the base rate back to 0.5%. It is the first split on the MPC since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in July 2016, when Jan Vlieghe had voted for a cut in interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. The rest of the MPC opposed him but then voted for a cut in August 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official tweet: Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of just 0.25%. But in a major surprise, one member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Kristin Forbes, has voted to raise interest rates back to 0.5%. Forbes was outvoted by the other eight members of the committee, though. The Bank has also left its asset purchase scheme (quantitative easing) unchanged at \u00c2\u00a3435bn. More to follow! Newsflash: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid for Sky being referred to media regulator Ofcom. The UK government has asked regulators to investigate whether the \u00c2\u00a311.7bn deal, launched last December, would give the media mogul too much influence over the UK news landscape. Ofcom must now also judge whether Murdoch family are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd owners of the company, following the phone-hacking scandal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Brexit continues to loom over the UK economy today. Supermarket chain Sainsbury has warned that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum continues to create uncertainty: And Toyota accompanied its new \u00c2\u00a3240m investment in the UK with a call for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ontinued tariff- and barrier-free market access\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Europe. Newsflash: there are reports of an explosion at the offices of the International Monetary Fund in Paris. In less than 40 minutes, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on interest rates. The City widely expects the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to leave borrowing costs at the current record low of 0.25%. However, the minutes of the meeting may show some more hawkish policymakers making noises about reversing last August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate cut, following the Brexit vote. With the Dutch election over, City traders are now refocusing their attention on the French polls in late April. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, Caxton FX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency market analyst, says the euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ou of the woods yet: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incumbent candidate, Mark Rutte, was victorious in the Dutch elections. While Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party secured second place, he is unlikely to be part of the coalition government. The euro strengthened on the results. Markets had feared that a victory for Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party could lend support to populist candidates in other European elections. A turn to populism in Europe could call into question the strength of the EU and the euro. Traders will be closely watching the French and German elections. Any causes for concern could test euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent lows. French centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron is extending his lead in the betting market -- but votes in the ballot boxes are what counts. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at OFX, says last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise is still moving the markets today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As far as the markets were concerned, the Dutch election result was somewhat of a relief, and damp squib. The euro has reacted positively to Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win, or at least it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been well supported since the result. The Fed decision and statement last night got more of a reaction - Yellen was a lot less hawkish than investors were expecting. If you missed it...the key news was that the Federal Reserve still expects to raise interest rates three times in 2017 (including last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hike), rather than getting aggressive and hiking four times. Newsflash: Japanese carmaker Toyota has announced plans to invest \u00c2\u00a3240m in its UK operations. Despite the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU, the Japanese carmarker is planning to upgrade the Burnaston plant near Derby. The money will improve the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness and promote UK supply chain efficiencies, it says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics on the Dutch election: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is continuing to hit record levels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up a stonking 69 points at 7438, up nearly 1% today. Plenty of City experts are commenting on the Dutch elections, and what it means for the eurozone. Darren Ruane, Head of Fixed Income at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first place is boosting share prices today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The results of the Dutch election helped to buoy investment markets following a better-than-expected outcome for mainstream parties. In particular, current Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal Party is projected to take 33 seats in the 150 seat lower house of parliament. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The anti-Islam Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, is seen as a relative loser from the election. Prior to the election, the Freedom Party was a frontrunner in the polls in early January. Given that there is a lack of interest in both the Freedom party to form a coalition with other parties and vice-versa, the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy influence should be limited. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In investment markets, European equities have risen by around 1% in early trade, although some of the optimism is follow-through from an expected US interest rate decision last night. Government bond yields in Europe are trading only marginally lower from overnight levels. Bond markets were forecasting a benign outcome from the Dutch elections, with a very strong gain for Wilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Freedom party required to disrupt markets in a meaningful way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, says it could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turning point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the popularity of populist parties \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The poorer than expected performance of Geert Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Freedom Party is good news for the eurozone, with the euro gaining as the results pointed to a clear victory for Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre right VVD party. This is a market positive result, although with a three party coalition looking unviable, a long negotiating period to form a government is likely. This is not helpful for a Greek bailout review. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will of course now turn their attention to France, where the candidacy of the far right Marine Le Pen arguably poses greater risks. To whatever extent this vote is a signal on France, the high turnout and rally around towards the mainstream centre look bad for her. The structure of the French presidential election also create additional obstacles to any far right victory in France. As such, the Dutch result may be remembered as the turning point in the popularity of populism for 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing, says fears that the Netherlands could follow Britain out of the EU have abated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win for the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Party for Freedom and Democracy today dramatically reduces the likelihood of a referendum to leave the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdDespite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outcome, there are still other European elections taking place later this year, and undoubtedly continued political uncertainty in the region. But instead of focusing on politics, we should probably concern ourselves more with the fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising employment continues to propel the eurozone region towards 2% growth. Add in inflation and operational gearing, and growth at a company level starts to look interesting. There are some selected good structural growth stories across Europe. What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learnt from Brexit is that no one knows how key political events are going to transpire, and what the stock markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to those events will be. As investors, it is better to stick to what you do know and focus on a long-term investment horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Pepijn Bergsen of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that mainstream parties still face a battle against populist rivals: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roaring markets, from the Daily Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham: European stock markets have hit their highest level in 15 months, as the Dutch election results calm fears over the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange is romping ahead, hitting its highest level since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. And in London, the FTSE 100 is keeping climbing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up over 50 points at 7423 for the first time ever. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risk appetite returns in spades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the markets. The FTSE 100 index hit a record intra-day high as equity markets responded to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Despite policymakers being more firmly agreed on three hikes this year rather than just two, markets took it as a dovish signal that the Fed is going to only cautiously tighten as the economy improves. The message was that the economy is firing but inflation is not going to be an issue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no hurry to raise rates and that is good news for equities. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of relief too as the Dutch elections showed no strong support for populists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping send the euro to a 5-week high and lifting European equities. A softer dollar is also supporting the risk rally, particularly commodities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index, made up of shares in medium-sized companies, has also just hit a record high. It gained 97 points in early trading to hit 19,061 points, up over 0.4%. Newsflash: Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has held interest rates unchanged at minus 0.75%, and warned that the global economy faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - including Brexit. The SNB says: Chief among these are political uncertainty with respect to the future course of economic policy in the US, upcoming elections in Europe, and the complex exit negotiations between the UK and the EU. Mining stocks are leading the rally in London this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s typically a sign that investors are more optimistic about the global economy (more growth = more demand for iron ore, copper, coal and nickel). Anglo American, the resource giant, is the top riser - after Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal announced he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking a \u00c2\u00a32bn stake in the company. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather more palatable Dutch election result than feared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has helped boost risk appetite in the markets, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Markets are being allowed to ponder the potential for less populist French and German political outcomes in the months to come while further US stimulus supports both US growth and Fed policy normalisation, in turn helping global growth. Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index of leading shares gained 40 points to hit 7411 points for the first time ever, up over 0.5% this morning. Other European stock markets are also jumping, as relief over the Dutch elections sweeps trading floors in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid. And the Amsterdam stock market has gained 0.8% to its highest level since December 2007. RBC Capital Markets says that the Dutch election result is bolstering hopes that a mainstream candidate will win the French presidential elections this spring The electoral spotlight now moves to France where the first round of voting in the presidential election takes place on Sunday April 23rd with the focus on the prospects of Marine Le Pen. Already markets have begun to take some signals (see above) from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch result that the electoral prospects of anti-EU populist parties may be checked. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says investors are also buying shares on relief that the US Federal Reserve sounded cautious on interest rate policy last night: Investors were looking for Yellen to hint on either 4 rate hikes in total this year or a rate hike sooner than expected, possibly in June in order to further fuel the Dollar rally. On the contrary, the Fed Chief mentioned neither of these possibilities and instead said that the central bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discuss in detail potential policy changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The euro hit a five-week high this morning, touching $1.0746 against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the dollar is weaker across the board, after the US Federal Reserve was more cautious than expected about future interest rate hikes yesterday. But the Dutch election is also a factor. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: It is all over and public has put an end to the nonsense populist concept which started with Brexit. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has comfortably beaten the anti-Islam Freedom party. We have a moment of calm and this has helped the euro to rally as everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Mr Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 victory could have provided a tailwind for Marine Le Pen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign in France, which could have put the future of the euro in jeopardy. European government bonds are strengthening this morning, following Geert Wilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to claim first place in the Dutch election. French debt is in demand, as investors take it as a sign that Marine Le Pen might be thwarted in her bid to win the presidency. Reuters has the details: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government bond yields hit a one-week low in early trade on Thursday after results of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch parliamentary elections suggested that populist party PVV would come a distant second to the current ruling party. Dutch centre-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte scored a resounding victory over anti-Islam and anti-EU Geert Wilders in an election on Wednesday. French government bonds were seen as vulnerable to a potential victory for PVV, as France faces its own presidential elections in April and May, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen in with a chance to win the keys to Elysee Palace. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bond yield fell 5 basis points to one-week low of 0.99%. Most other euro zone bond yields were also lower on the day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England Day! Over in Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is putting the finishing touches to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on monetary policy. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a change on interest rates, which are currently at a record low of just 0.25%. But the minutes of the meeting will be poured over for signs that the Bank may be considering whether to tighten policy in response to rising inflation. The decision comes at noon. Analysts at PNC believe that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures, which showed falling pay growth and a rise in self-employment, will encourage the Bank to sit tight for several months. Lower wage growth and a shift to self-employment (possibly a disguised form of underemployment) reinforces our view that slack has increased in the British labor market since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, making a bank rate hike unlikely in 2017. Another reason not to expect a rate hike is that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC believes Brexit will be a headwind to British output over the medium term, for example by reducing market access for British services exports to EU end-markets which account for 5 percent of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be mopping up reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise. As we blogged, the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs to 1%, but maintained a cautious approach to normalising monetary policy. That sparked a rally on Wall Street last night, and Europe is likely to follow suit his morning. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you, Janet Yellen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market message to the U.S. Fed Chair. The greenback [US dollar] is falling while everything else is in green today after the Federal Reserve delivered on its promise to hike rates by 25 basis points. While this move was widely expected, many market participants were positioned for a more hawkish language and an upgrade in economic projections which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen City traders believe the FTSE 100 could hit a new record high! European investors are also digesting the results of the Dutch election. Far-right populist Geert Wilders has failed to claim first place, claiming just 20 seats - behind Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-right VVD party which is set to win 33. That appears to leave VVD clear to form a new coalition; it may take a few weeks, but fears of another populist shock victory can now recede. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know:",

                "bodyText":"Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended a busy week at a new all-time closing high. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a modest rally - the blue-chip index has finished 9 points higher at 7424 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on the new record high of 7447 set this afternoon. Insurance firm Admiral led the risers, up 2%, with medical products maker Convatec and budget airline easyJet close behind. European markets are showing some gains too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX also finished 0.1% higher, while the French CAC gained 0.3%. Investors have taken this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise in their stride -- mainly because the Fed reassured them that borrowing costs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too fast over the next couple of years Relief that the Dutch far-right \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 came second in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election also made for a good week in the City. But there is still plenty for investors to worry about this weekend; Brexit hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone away, and nor have calls for another Scottish vote on independence. Plus, who knows what Donald Trump will do next week? His meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel is underway now, but looks a little awkward... Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons next week should be a little quieter than the last few days - although new UK inflation figures (on Tuesday) will be interesting. The coming week is a quieter one, at least compared to this one. UK CPI and retail sales will ensure that sterling remains a focus of attention, after the pound rallied from its lows thanks to the Fed meeting. However, it looks like we are in for a period of quiet, at least where events are concerned. Stocks remain expensive, but index inflows keep supporting the market, and for now there is no sign of a major dip emerging any time soon. So on that note, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrap up. Hope you have a lovely weekend. GW A gobbet of eurozone news: Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has just reaffirmed Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, with a stable outlook: The OECD has put more pressure on governments to reform their economies, and help more people benefit from faster growth. Otherwise, the think tank warns, they will continue to lose the support and faith of voters. My colleage Katie Allen explains: The report, presented by OECD secretary general Angel Gurria at a meeting of finance ministers from the G20 group of nations in Germany calls on governments to take a long-term view of jobs and skills, infrastructure spending and innovation. It also calls for more focus on tackling inequality to win back public support for reforms. The group, which covers 35 mainly rich countries including the UK, notes that on average only 40% of OECD citizens trust their governments. Newsflash: US consumer confidence continues to grow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the University of Michigan, Its monthly consumer sentiment index has jumped to 97.6 in March, from 96.3 in February. And the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrent conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index, which asks people how their feel about their financial situation today, jumped by three points to 114.5, the highest reading since November 2000. The survey also found that Republicans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than Democrats about expectations for their finances. Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, says: The sentiment data has been characterised by rising optimism as well as by rising uncertainty due to the partisan divide. Optimism promotes discretionary spending, and uncertainty makes consumers more cautious spenders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FTSE 100 is on track to set a closing high for the second day running (on top of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday high). Henry Croft of Accendo Markets reckons investors are ending the week in good heart: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equity markets across the globe are positive as improved risk appetite continues into the weekend, although the pace of gains has slowed as drivers (data/corporate) are light on the ground. Investors are continuing to digest the multiple central bank monetary policy updates this week, including surprising hawkishness from the Bank of England [on Thursday]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 just nudged a new alltime intraday high. The blue-chip index has hit the heady heights of 7447 points, up 30 points today - and two points higher than Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak. Royal Bank of Scotland, the financial institution bailed out by the taxpaper in 2008, is leading the rally - up 2.3% today. Ooooh. Bloomberg are reporting that the G20 finance chiefs have removed a reference to climate change from the statement they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll released on Saturday, at the end of their meeting. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to Germany, the meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s host. It hoped to include a section about climate issues, but there appears to be a major disagreement over the issue. Bloomberg says: Deputies concluded crafting the communique on Thursday evening, and ministers and central-bank governors will debate the document in the German town of Baden-Baden on Friday. The language may still change before the final version is released the next day. Germany is using its year as G-20 president to push for the group to support climate protection. That effort has run into resistance from countries including the U.S., China, India and Saudi Arabia, one G-20 official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were private. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There can be a way to overcome disagreements today -- that is, not writing about it in the communique,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told reporters in the southwestern German spa town on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But not writing about it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean not talking about it. Not writing about it means that there are difficulties, that there is a disagreement and that we we must work on them in the coming months. Over in Baden-Baden, G20 finance ministers are trying to hammer out a statement on free trade. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, told reporters that there were some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensible positions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among delegates on the issue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the exact wording but nobody has raised the issue of protectionism yet and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that we have to deal with this a lot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about finding the right wording, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about how we phrase the openness of the world trade system in the final communique,.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Lukman Otunuga of FXTM Research says the stock market bounce following Wednesday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting is fading. Traders were excited on Wednesday and Thursday that the Fed didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t predict more rate hikes in 2017 and 2018; today, though, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more concerned about the G20 finance ministers meeting in Germany: Otunuga says: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd powered stock market rally slightly cooled off during Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session with investors turning cautious ahead of the anticipated G20 meeting. Asian shares were mostly mixed as participants weighed on the prospects of fewer US interest rates increases this year. In Europe, the defensive trading mood slightly pressured equities and the bearish contagion could limit gains on Wall Street this evening. An explosively volatile trading week is slowly coming to an end with investors turning their attention towards the G20 finance meeting which could offer some insights on how world leaders feel about key topics such as protectionism and global growth. With some discussions of currencies also being a possibility, the Greenback could turn volatile if leaders start to discuss the impacts of its resurgence since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential victory. After a weak start, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are now pushing higher. The FTSE 100 is up 19 points at 7435; a small rise, but only 10 points away from beating yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time intraday high. After the excitement earlier this week (a US rate hike, a split at the Bank of England), the markets seem to be meandering towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says: Looking to the US open and the Dow Jones is set for a quiet start to the session, with the futures suggesting at 10 point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. Now that the Fed rate raise is done and dusted the Dow may struggle to find any meaningful direction in the coming weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, of course, unless Donald Trump (who has been relatively quiet of late) unleashes some kind of market-shaking pronouncement. The eurozone has posted its first trade deficit in the years. Imported goods from the rest of the world surged by 17% year-on-year in January, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac164.5bn, according to Eurostat. Exports rose by 13% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac163.9bn. This left the euro area with a deficit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600m; the first since January 2014. The wider European Union posted a trade in goods deficit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16.2bn in January (partly due to Britain). That included a large trade deficit with China, but a larger surplus with the United States: High demand for energy in the winter months helped to cause Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Imports can also be lifted appreciably in the winter months if colder than usual weather leads to a pick-up in energy imports. However, the weakened traded goods performance in January will make it harder for net trade to contribute positively to Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 after being a drag in the fourth quarter of 2016. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s man in Baden-Baden, Steven Mnuchin, has met with his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso: Mnuchin is expected to push G20 ministers not to deliberately weaken their currencies to win export business - something that Trump gets most irate about. But Aso may not appreciate any criticism; last month he denied that the yen was weak. Mark Carney is also warning that confidence in the financial sector, and trust in the markets, has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years. In his letter to G20 finance chiefs, Carney says the Financial Stability Board is taking steps to make financial benchmarks more trustworthy (after a series of rigging scandals). It is also bolstering codes of conduct across the industry, and change financial institutions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 governance and compensation structures to reduce misconduct risk. Carney also hints that simply slapping multi-billion fines on big banks isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only solution; individuals need to be held to account too. He says: The work recognises that, while fines and sanctions deter misconduct, preventative measures, including those which increase individual accountability, can also play important roles. The FSB is promising to: (i) deliver to G20 Leaders a report drawing together actions taken and recommendations made to address misconduct risk across the various elements of the action plan; and (ii) publish a consultation paper on the use of compensation tools to address misconduct The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system risks suffer serious harm if policymakers fail to implement the measures drawn up to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis, Mark Carney has warned. Carney fired a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchurry-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 towards the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top finance ministers and central bankers as the G20 meeting got underway in Germany. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushing them to tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshadow banking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which takes place away from the regulators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gaze) and risky derivatives trading. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting in his role as head of the Financial Stability Board (the Bank of England governor is wearing two hats in Baden-Baden this weekend) He warned that there \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a risk of a loss of momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in completing, and implementing, international standards. This could lead to fragmented funding and liquidity markets, driving up the cost of finance in the real economy. Carney concludes: A decade on from the start of the crisis, the G20 has made substantial progress in building a financial system that is more resilient and better able to fund households and business in sustainable way. As the global recovery gains strength, now is not the time to risk these hardwon gains. And here are the FSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four priorities to avoid a repeat of the mayhem of 2008. Transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance, including by addressing structural vulnerabilities in asset management; Making derivatives markets safer by progressing the post-crisis reforms to over-the-counter derivatives markets and delivering coordinated guidance on central counterparty resilience, recovery and resolution; Supporting full and consistent implementation of post-crisis reforms, including the development of a structured framework for post-implementation evaluation of the effects of reforms; and Addressing new and emerging vulnerabilities, including misconduct risks, as well as those stemming from the decline in correspondent banking and from climate-related financial risks Some photos from the G20 meeting just landed: Almost five years after being forced out of Barclays over the Libor rate rigging scandal, Bob Diamond has made a dramatic return to the City. Diamond has pulled off an audacious takeover of City stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, through his Atlas Merchant Capital in an alliance with the Qatari royal family. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying a 68% premium for Panmure, which is one of the oldest brokerage in the Square Mile. Analysts believe Diamond could now turn Panmure into a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcboutique\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment bank. In the City, shares in housebuilder Berkeley Group have jumped by 6% this morning after it issued an upbeat trading statement. Profits will be at the top end of expectations, it said, despite a 16% drop in reservations since the Brexit vote. But Tullow Oil have slumped by 15%, after it announced plans for a \u00c2\u00a3607m rights issue to tackle its debt burden. The cash call is priced at a 45% discount to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, prompting this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is pluckily bucking the downward trend this morning: European stock markets have begun the day on the back foot. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is down 0.4% in early trading, as the country prepares to welcome finance ministers and central bank bosses from across the G20. That dragged the wider Stoxx 600 index down by 0.3%, with France and Spain also in the red. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped by 8 points after hitting a record closing high of 7415 last night. Henry Croft, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets, says political drama may drive the markets today: With this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank updates and the Dutch election now in the rear view mirror, in focus today will be a multitude of high level political summits. The US President Donald Trump is hosting the German Chancellor President Angela Merkel, as the leader of the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engine room meets face to face with the outspoken US chief for the first time since he took office. In Europe, Theresa May will address the Conservative Spring Forum around midday - expect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit means Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 soundbites aplenty and potentially some remarks towards the SNP - while the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers in Baden-Baden will likely be headlined by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first appearance on the global stage (trade in focus?) and, of course, the looming challenge of Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders are enjoying a brighter commute to the office this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Spring Equilux - when the days start being longer than the nights, and winter gloom becomes but a memory. However, this new extra daylight may be wasted on us today, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too much actually going on. After rallying yesterday, European stock markets are expected to dip back this morning - as the boost from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch election fades. The economics calendar is a little sparse. 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output for January 2pm GMT: The US consumer confidence report from the University of Michigan 5pm GMT: The weekly Baker Hughes count of US oil rigs in operation Investors may also be watching Washington, where German chancellor Angela Merkel is meeting US president Donald Trump (her visit was delayed by heavy snow on Tuesday).

Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 2.8 million. US shale oil producers have been increasing the number of rigs, pushing up production. Analysts at US bank Jefferies commented in a note: OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market intervention has not yet resulted in significant visible inventory drawdowns, and the financial markets have lost patience. Thames Water has been handed a record \u00c2\u00a320.3m fine after huge leaks of untreated sewage. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency, which said the enormous volume of sewage, at 1.4bn litres, was unprecedented. It relates to numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. Full story here: The pound appears to have lost some of the boost it gained from the sharp rise in UK inflation revealed on Tuesday. (The consumer prices index jumped more than expected to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January, pushed higher by food and fuel prices.) The pound is still above $1.24 but down 0.3% on the day at $1.2440. It is also down 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1516. Wall Street will be closely monitoring any developments in the debate on the Republican health care bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday, and failure to pass it would be a huge blow to Trump. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off... US markets have opened lower, but the early falls are modest: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 20,629 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,342 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,790 Donald Trump is awake and would like to reassure markets: Wall Street bell goes in 10 minutes... Twitter has reacted with a combination of anger and humour to those Dijsselbloem comments that appear to be critical of the behaviour of Southern European countries. The FTSE 100 is currently down 65 points or 0.9% at 7,314. The FTSE 250 is down 1.1% at 18,788. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, provides this lunchtime summary: A partial reversal of the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump Trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has sent defensives and precious metal producers to the top of the FTSE 100 today, as investors worry that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conflict with Congress will prevent him delivering the pro-business agenda on which he campaigned. Only six FTSE 100 stocks had made it into positive territory at lunchtime, with Randgold topping the list, up 0.8%. Despite recently warning that conditions remain challenging, hopes of an uptick in the global economy helped FTSE 250 shipping group Clarkson enjoy a strong run recently. However, with pro-Trump sentiment wavering it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps unsurprising to see this bellwether of global trade lose some of the wind from its sails, sending the shares down 4.5%. Earlier the Bank of England published its latest agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summary of business conditions. The Bank has 12 regional agents who have discussions with about 700 firms across the UK to glean the latest snapshot of conditions. The survey for the first quarter of 2017 found that growth in retail sales was slowing as the weak pounds feeds through to higher prices and reduces the spending power of consumers. Overall the report was mixed, with exports up and investment intentions picking up. Agents concluded: Moderate rates of activity growth had continued overall. Retail sales volumes growth had eased. It was expected to slow further during the year ahead as the fall in sterling fed through to higher prices, reducing households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power. In contrast, export volume growth had picked up. That was due to the fall in sterling and stronger world growth. Investment intentions had picked up, pointing to modest growth in spending in the year ahead. That reflected continued moderate demand growth and less uncertainty about economic prospects, particularly in the near term. But a lack of visibility of the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading arrangements was weighing on longer-term plans for some contacts. The fall in sterling was being passed through into higher manufacturing output and consumer goods price inflation. Business and consumer services price inflation had edged higher. Over in Brussels, Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - appears to be in a spot of bother. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said Dijsselbloem was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make comments that were interpreted as criticism of southern European countries. Speaking to the German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Dijsselbloem said: In the euro crisis, the northern eurozone states demonstrated solidarity with the countries in crisis. As a Social Democrat, I believe solidarity is extremely important. But whoever demands it also has obligations. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. This principle holds at personal, local, national and even European levels. His comments drew strong criticism in Spain and Italy and the Portuguese prime minister called for Dijsselbloem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. A spokesman for Dijsselbloem defended his comments along the following lines: He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refer to any specific country or group of countries. His message was that solidarity comes with obligations, and the message was for all eurozone countries. Now for some news from Coventry, where the grand opening of the first new car plant in Britain for more than a decade is taking place today. The London Taxi Company (LTC), maker of the famous London black cab, will build electric cabs at the plant, creating more than 1,000 jobs. It is being funded by a \u00c2\u00a3300m investment from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of LTC, plus a \u00c2\u00a316.1m government grant. As well as being a boost for Coventry it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boost for the UK automotive industry, which backed the remain camp in the EU referendum and has voiced concerns that Brexit will lead foreign investment elsewhere. The business secretary Greg Clarke said the new factory, where research and development will also take place, showed that the UK was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world leader in the development of new automotive technologies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Read our full story on the new plant here: Global equities could have quite a bit further to fall according to analysts at Saxo Bank, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-growth policies hit several hurdles along the way. Peter Garnry, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of equity strategy, explains: So much of the narrative has revolved around US president Donald Trump since his election on November 8 but the conviction in the reflation trade faded abruptly in the last US session with the S&amp;P 500 declining more than 1% for the first time since October. So what are we to make of all of this? Where do we go from here? Global equities could easily fall 5-10% in what would be a normal healthy technical correction. And the selloff will be driven by cyclicals: financials, materials, consumer discretionary - a big question mark here is whether technology stocks will hold the line. We see further upside in volatility as markets are now constructing a new narrative that essentially centres on the likelihood that the pro-growth Trump policies or set for a bumpy road with many road blocks . Credit growth has stalled lately and the energy impulse into inflation is gone by June. Gold is benefitting from the widespread equities sell-off and weaker dollar. Spot gold touched a three-week high of $1,248.47 per ounce, and is currently up 0.1% at $1,245. Edward Meir, analyst at INTL FCStone said gold would continue to benefit while investors sold shares: It seems that equity investors decided to take some money of the table, perhaps getting slightly wary about the progress in President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative agenda. Gold will likely continue to rally going into Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session as Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US stock market sell-off was significant and will likely have a knock-on effect on international equity markets over the next 24 hours. Some people are feeling the pinch more than others of course. A report by the Equality Trust found that the average FTSE bosses earns 386 times more than a worker on the national living wage. Taking 2015 annual reports from all FTSE 100 companies, the charity calculated that chief executives were paid \u00c2\u00a35.3m a year, compared with \u00c2\u00a313,662 for someone on the national living wage of \u00c2\u00a37.20 an hour. Here is the full story from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen: Investors are not the only ones feeling pessimistic. UK households are the most downbeat about prospects for their finances since November 2013 according to the Markit Household Finance Index. Families are starting to feel the pinch of rising inflation, as everyday goods get more expensive and wage growth remains weak. It suggests that consumer spending - the main driver of UK growth currently - will start to weaken as households become more cost conscious. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: UK households reported greater pressure on their financial wellbeing in March, as rising inflation has started to erode incomes and reduce cash available to spend. On average in the first quarter of 2017 survey respondents have reported the sharpest increase in their everyday living costs for three-and-a-half years. A combination of rising inflation and subdued pay trends has forced households to recalibrate their expectations for the year ahead. After holding steady last summer, UK consumers are now more downbeat about their financial outlook than at any time since late-2013. Expectations for finances in the next month fell to 45.3 on the index in March, from 48.1 in February, where anything below 50 signals contraction. People living in the East Midlands were the most downbeat about their financial outlook, followed by those in the North East and London. Meanwhile 58% of households expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months. US futures suggest the sell-off on Wall Street is likely to continue when markets open later: Dow Jones futures: -0.3% Nasdaq futures: -0.2% Is this the end of the Trump rally, asks David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co? European stock indices are weaker across the board this morning. Investors are responding to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off on Wall Street which saw the majors close out on their lows. Not only that, but US stock index futures are weaker again this morning. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp reversal took many investors by surprise, particularly as the US session opened with fresh all-time highs for Facebook and the Nasdaq index. Unfortunately for traders, much of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move was down to political factors rather than market technicals. There are fears that the Trump administration won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act when it goes to Congress tomorrow. There are thought to be around 26 Republican representatives who oppose their party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new health care bill. This in turn could jeopardise Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan and this has worried investors who have watched equities soar on the promise of fiscal stimulus. The final scores in Asia: Back in the UK, estate agent Savills has published results. Shares are currently down 1.8%. Julia Kollewe reports: Savills, the upmarket estate agent, has posted annual pretax profits of nearly \u00c2\u00a3100m, up 1%, despite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical distractions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and higher property taxes in the UK and elsewhere. The Brexit vote in June pushed revenues from its UK residential business down 3% to \u00c2\u00a3124m last year. The firm explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A very strong first quarter, as buyers rushed to beat the increased stamp duty on second homes, was followed by low trading volumes in advance of the Brexit referendum at the end of June. Then a relatively quiet, but encouraging summer gave rise to a strong autumn selling season albeit with a slowing of transactions in December.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Savills said the sharp decline in the value of sterling since the referendum had drawn overseas buyers at the top end of the market. The average selling price in London increased slightly to \u00c2\u00a32.9m because the firm sold more properties worth \u00c2\u00a320m or more than in 2015. But it still recorded 5% fewer sales overall, while the market suffered even bigger declines. Outside London there was a 7% increase in exchanges. US bond yields are at three-week lows as investors dump equities in favour of lower-risk assets. The yield on benchmark 10-year US treasuries - an indicator of how much it costs the government to borrow from the financial markets - fell to 2.4%. Kingfisher, the company behind B&amp;Q and Screwfix, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning following the publication of annual results. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Shares in Kingfisher fell 4.8% despite better-than-expected results. The retailer warned of modest price increases and expressed concern that uncertainty around French and British politics could hit demand for its DIY products. Chief executive V\u00c3\u00a9ronique Laury, who is overseeing a five-year revamp of the business, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France, especially in light of the forthcoming presidential elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company beat City forecasts with a 14.7% rise in annual underlying pretax profit to \u00c2\u00a3787m. A good performance in the UK &amp; Ireland, where like-for-like sales rose 5.9%, offset a 2.7% sales drop in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico D\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t. The retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman Daniel Bernard is to step down in June after eight years in the role. He will be succeeded by Andy Cosslett, the former chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group and Fitness First, who previously worked at Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. He also chairs Rugby Football Union. Investors are not happy at all this morning. Losses are widening across Europe on fears that Trump is not going to be able to deliver on his policy pledges. Much of the optimism about his policies to boost US (and therefore global) growth has already been priced into markets since his election, with Wall Street and European markets hitting record highs. But as President Trump deals with the reality of governing, it seems determination alone is not enough to push through his flagship policies. If Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet managed to overhaul Obamacare - his key priority - won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his promises on tax giveaways and infrastructure spending get kicked into the long grass? Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says markets are in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sour mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Based on the mess Republicans are making of their healthcare reforms it seems increasingly unlikely that the Wotsit-in-Chief will be able to deliver on his sweeping tax changes and $1 trillion infrastructure spending. Combine that with the Wall Street Journal, a notably right-leaning publication, claiming that if Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshow more respect for the truth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost Americans may conclude he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and the optimism that caused investors to flock to the major indices has been seriously undermined by, well, Trump himself. The FTSE 100 is down 72 points as the negative sentiment spreads. The mining sector and financials are taking the brunt of it. Current scores on the board: FTSE 100: -1% at 7,306 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.8% at 11,871 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.8% at 4,963 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 19,706 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.9% at 10,126 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 373 The pound is just about holding on to the gains it made against the dollar on Tuesday following the sharp rise in UK inflation to 2.3% in February from 1.8%. In theory, the acceleration of inflation brings forward the prospect of a UK interest rate rise and adds weight to the decision by Kristin Forbes - member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee - to vote for a hike at the March meeting (she was outvoted). The pound is also being supported by dollar weakness, and is currently flat at $1.2477. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1550. European markets have opened lower, as fears ripple across the Atlantic over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push through growth-boosting policies: FTSE 100: -0.6% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.8% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.7% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.9% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.7% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% Nouriel Roubini, the economist who is probably best known for predicting the global financial crisis, has also warned on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Specifically, the professor at NYU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stern School of Business, says markets have over-estimated how many beneficial policies the President can carry through, while underestimating the potential negatives. Roubini told CNBC: [Markets] are overestimating the positives of the US-Trump policies. Infrastructure, stimulus, deregulation, tax cuts: I think Trump will achieve much less on those dimensions. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re underestimating the risk that the US protectionist policies are going to lead to trade wars, that the restrictions on immigration are going to slow down labor supply, and that micromanaging the corporate sector is going to be negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares in Asia are down sharply this morning following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day this year. It appears that hopes are evaporating of swift action on the growth-boosting policies promised by President Trump. With much of the upside already priced in, investors are now coming to the realisation that for all the talk, it might take longer than expected to push through reforms. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: After the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest one day fall since last October last year, the question being asked is whether the scales are starting to fall away from investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes as to whether President Trump will be able to deliver anything close to what has been priced into markets since his election last November. Even the mistiest eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised and as such any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future. Here is how US markets closed: Dow Jones: -1.1% at 20,668 S&amp;P 500: -1.2% at 2,344 Nasdaq: -1.5% at 5,333 And in Asia: Hang Seng: -1.3% at 24,275 Nikkei: -2% at 19,041 Topix: -2% at 1,530 Shares in Europe are expected to open lower this morning: We will be tracking all the key developments.",

The short-term lettings industry is attempting to clean-up its reputation with the creation of a new trade body. Airbnb has teamed up with Under The Doormat and various other sites to form the short-term accommodation association (STAA). The industry has been criticised for contributing to the housing crisis by taking properties out of the market. Merilee Karr, chairman of STAA and the founder of Under the Doormat, said the new body intended to create a new industry code: We understand there are concerns but the reality is that short-term lettings offer an opportunity for people to earn an extra source of income from their most important assets. Homeowners and families who have struggled through the financial crisis have the chance to make a little extra money when they are away. We will also set our industry code of conduct to raise the bar for our members and new market entrants to ensure the standards that we have all worked so hard to make are the industry norm. Unite, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest union, has renewed its calls for access to the single market after Brexit. It follows the strong car manufacturing figures for February. Len McCluskey, general secretary, said: These astonishingly good figures clearly demonstrate that the automotive industry is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjewel in the crown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of British manufacturing which the prime minister needs to vigorously fight for in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red line for the car industry is access to the European single market with no tariffs and a frictionless supply chain through membership of the customs union. Unite and the car companies are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in wanting this success story to continue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and protecting and enhancing the dominant role that the automotive industry plays in the British economy should be at the top of the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda when the Brexit talks start. New us home sales rose by 6.1% to 592,000 in February, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since July 2016. The figure for January was also revised up to 558,000 from an earlier estimate of 555,000. New home sales account for almost 10% of overall home sales, and were boosted last month by some unseasonably warm weather. An update on Greece now, where it is hoped record tourism will provide a boost to the crisis-hit economy. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helena Smith reports: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest carrier, Aegean Airlines, has reported a rise in passenger numbers despite a drop in profits. The record numbers visiting Greece were reflected in the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, which showed that passengers grew 7% in 2016 to 12.5 million. Despite the airline posting a 53% drop in net profit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mainly because of higher VAT offsetting a rise in sales - the carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s load factor also increased by 0.6 percentage points to 77.4 percent. An unprecedented 30 million foreign tourists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost three times the entire Greek population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are likely to visit the country this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are expecting an exceptional year for tourism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimitris Tsiodras, spokesman of the centrist Potami party told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hellenic bankers were just telling us that they expect tourism to play a significant role in stabilising the economy. It is the bright light on the horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Syntagma square, overlooking the Greek parliament, kiosk owners were echoing that view this morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the coming weeks the tourist season will begin and we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pavlos Yiannopoulos as he hung newspapers from a rack. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to become the Florida of Europe.

Anyone looking for a steer on the timing of the next interest rate rise will be disappointed, as Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus was on young people and education, and not on monetary policy. She said more needed to be done to prepare young people for success in the jobs markets: Research presented over the next two days makes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to prepare people for success in the labor market. This research underscores the value of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy, and interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skills help prepare people for work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and be in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials that are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Yellen said a better long-term approach would be beneficial to the wider economy: Our young people are the future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and fulfilling lives. As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy when more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances. In short, ensuring that all of our kids have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong foundations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will help build a similarly strong foundation for the U.S. economy. The full speech is available here. New US jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week. The US Labor Department said initial claims were 258,000 in the week ending 18 March, following 243,000 claims a week earlier (revised up from 241,000). Economists had forecast 240,000 claims for the latest week. Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor for monetary policy, has given a speech in London on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He said consumers are already feeling the pinch from the drop in then value of the pound, and the effects are starting be reflected in shops sales: The vote to leave the EU led to a big drop in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate. One consequence is a rise in import prices and a squeeze on households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real income. We may already be seeing the impact of that squeeze on retail spending, which in real terms fell quite sharply around the turn of the year. Exporters on the other hand are enjoying a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he argued, because their goods are cheaper abroad but Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current membership of the EU means they are not yet facing additional tariffs. The result \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher prices and profits but unchanged rules and costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c represents something of a sweet spot for exporters and businesses that compete with imports. The sweet spot is not expected to last, he adds, which could make businesses more cautious about investing. No sign yet of that much feared slowdown in British car manufacturing following the Brexit vote. The number of cars rolling off UK production lines rose 8% in February (compared with a year earlier), to 153,041. It was the strongest February in 17 years, and meant that factories turned out one car every 16 seconds last month according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The vast majority - 78% - were destined for overseas market, with cars built for export up 13.4%. Domestic demand for British-built cars was much weaker, falling 7.4%. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT trade body, used the figures as an opportunity to highlight the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about possible trade tariffs post Brexit: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures illustrate the continuing global popularity of British-built vehicles and the export-led nature of the industry. With eight out of every 10 cars we produce destined for international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and half of those for customers in the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we must avoid barriers to trade, whether tariff, customs or other regulatory obstacles, at all costs. To do otherwise would damage our competitiveness and threaten the continued success of UK automotive manufacturing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Returning to the official retail sales for February, the strong monthly figure masks the underlying weakness revealed by the broader three-month trend. Over the three months, retail sales volumes fell 1.4%, the biggest drop since March 2010. The ONS suggested that higher fuel prices made drivers less willing to fill-up their tanks over the period. The narrowing gap between growth in shop prices and retail sales on a three-month basis, is illustrated here: The pound is just about holding on to one-month highs above $1.25: The CBI has just published its own survey of the retail sector, which is also slightly ahead of expectations. Strength in the retail sector continued into March according to the business lobby group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distributive trades survey. Of the retailers surveyed, 44% said sales volumes were up on a year ago, while 35% said they were down. That gave a balance of +9%, matching February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure but better than the +5% forecast by economists. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all plain sailing however. The CBI said retailers face the twin pressures of having to pay more for goods and materials, and increased competition. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the group, explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see that sales volumes growth is holding up and expectations have strengthened. However, retailers continue to be squeezed by rising cost pressures on the one hand, and intense competition on the other, which will limit their ability to raise prices. With household spending growth set to slow as inflation rises, retailers seem likely to remain under pressure through this year. Read our full story on the bumper retail sales figures for February: The surprisingly sharp rise in retail sales suggests UK consumers were not deterred from spending by higher shop prices in February. But this could change, economists are warning. In the same month, higher food and fuel prices pushed inflation up to 2.3% in February - the highest in almost three-and-a-half years - from 1.8% in January. Prices are expected to rise further still, with inflation forecast to hit about 3% later this year. As price rises accelerate, wage growth is weakening, meaning that household finances are likely to come under increasing strain in the coming months. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, prefers to look at retail sales over the three months to February, which fell 1.4%, rather than the single month. With shoppers facing a combination of still-subdued pay growth and rising inflation, Q1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely weak performance may be a harbinger for 2017 as a whole. Annual shop price inflation increased to 2.8% from 1.9% in January, a 60-month high. How the year pans out will depend heavily upon consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to draw on savings or take on more debt. While these sources may deliver some mitigation to squeezed spending power, last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail boom looks set to become an increasingly distant memory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank: UK retail sales showed the first upwards surprise for 3 months. Will it last? With inflation getting higher and higher, the fundamentals would suggest not - i.e. the squeeze on disposable income is intensifying. The downward glide path should resume in the coming months. Here is how Asian markets ended the day, courtesy of traders at spread-betting firm IG: The stronger-than-expected retail sales have helped to push the pound higher against the dollar and the euro. Sterling is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2510 and up 0.5% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1612. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at OFX, said a combination of factors were helping to drive the pound higher and could push it further still: Retail sales data was very strong this morning and sterling has rallied once again. It comes hot off the back of the headline inflation earlier in the week, with the hawkish MPC statement and rate vote results still resonating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to make for an even more aggressive BoE statement next month, with sterling up through 1.25 as a result. This recent combination of market data will likely support the pound through to the end of the week and perhaps into next. 1.26 could well be in sight. Figures just out show stronger than expected retail sales in February. Sales jumped 1.4%, signalling consumer resilience despite rising inflation and weak wage growth. Economists had forecast far weaker growth of 0.4%. The January figure was revised down to show a 0.5% drop in sales, bigger than the 0.3% drop initially estimated. A strong performance in February pushed the annual rate of growth to 3.7% from 1% in January. However, the Office for National Statistics cautioned the broader quarterly picture was less rosy. Retail sales over the three months to February fell by 1.4% form the second month in a row - the largest fall since March 2010 and only the second fall since December 2013. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January. The monthly growth in February is seen across all store types. The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months. Over in France, optimism among firms in the industrial sector fell to a four-month low in March, in a possible sign that uncertainty surrounding the presidential election is starting to weigh on confidence. The business climate index for the industrial sector, published by Insee, fell to 104 points in March from 107 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to stay at 107. European markets are in a subdued mood this morning as investors await the crucial US vote on the healthcare bill which seeks to overturn Obamacare. With many opposed to the bill in its current form, investors are concerned that should Trump lose the vote, his growth-boosting policy promises might not materialse. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex: The markets got off to an understandably quiet start this Thursday, the European indices gently slipping into the red after the bell. There are a couple of reasons why investors may be sitting on their hands this morning. Firstly, the tragedy in Westminster on Wednesday is the kind of event that casts the cold light of perspective on the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frivolities. Secondly, investors are waiting for the House of Representatives vote on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrumpcare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 later in the day; if the President can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the bill passed it would suggest he faces an uphill battle push through his tax and infrastructure reforms. And considering it was those promises that sent the Dow Jones et al. sky high, investors will likely not react well to that eventuality. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says that investors knew what was coming from the retailer in the form of the first profit drop in eight years. Not a pretty set of figures from Next but no worse than expected after warning on profits in January. Following that dire Christmas trading update investors were prepared for this and the retailer remains extremely cautious about the year ahead. It was the first drop in annual profits in 8 years but investors seem to be reassured that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking steps to turn things around with a focus on core products. Next has to get its house in order and focus more on its core product \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something it says it began doing in January. UK retail sales have held up in the months following the Brexit vote (led by clothing retail sales hit a 14-year peak in October) but Next has suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly not been getting things right. The question is whether a return to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be enough to offset the external headwinds. Fundamentally the business remains strongly cash generative even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not expanding rapidly and is able to maintain solid returns to investors. Shares have already halved in value since the 2015 peak. With the Directory division performing very well it appears well placed to respond to consumer trends as they shift more spend online. Next is at the top of the FTSE 100 leader board this morning, despite reporting its first annual profits fall in eight years. Shares in the clothing and homeware retailer are up 6% at \u00c2\u00a341.05 after it said pre-tax profit fell 5.5% to \u00c2\u00a3790.2m last year. It was in line with City expectations, so investors were relieved there were no nasty surprises in the numbers. Chief executive Lord Wolfson said the year ahead was also looking challenging: The year ahead looks like it will be tough with a combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us. Next also signalled a shift in emphasis in its clothing ranges, suggesting it had neglected simpler, popular ranges, in favour of more fashionable lines. In focussing so much energy on changing our buying culture, processes and adopting exciting new trends, we have omitted some of our best-selling, heartland product from our ranges. These are the easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours. Corrective action is relatively straightforward and began in late January. We believe that some of these changes will begin to be reflected in our Summer ranges from May onwards, but we will not have our ranges where we want them until the Autumn season. Trading is Europe is underway and investors are in following Asia and Wall Street by taking a bit of a breather. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points or 0.2% at 7,312. Elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 11,914 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: flat at 4,995 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,985 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,242 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 374 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets are subdued after Wall Street stabilised on Wednesday. Fears that President Trump will not be able to deliver on his growth boosting policy pledges have not gone away, but investors appear to be taking a breather before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial vote on the Republican healthcare bill in the US. The bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare and has been a key priority for Trump from the outset, is a major test for the President. A failure to win the vote will ring alarm bells on Wall Street and beyond that Trump will not be able to deliver other policy pledges, such as tax giveaways and infrastructure spending. In Asia, the Hang Seng was down 0.2% at 24,278, while the Nikkei rose 0.2% to 19,085. Here is how Wall Street closed on Wednesday: Also today, we have official UK retail sales for February at 9.30am, giving an insight into how resilient consumers are feeling in the face of rising inflation and weak wage growth. The CBI will give its take on the retail sector in its latest distributive survey at 11am. And in the US, Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, will give a speech. We will be tracking all the key developments through the day.",

                "bodyText":"Financial experts are split over whether Trump can move past the healthcare headache and deliver tax reforms. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is still cautiously optimistic that the Trump White House will be able to push through many of their pro-business policies, and I think a lot of people are hopeful the Trump rally can continue through at least the middle of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Weston of IG also reckons the markets could keep rallying, despite political worries: It is a stretch to believe anyone has really bought into the idea that the Trump administration can really deliver on far-reaching tax reform. But what we can see, is that to a large extent it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to worry them too much either. This is a Teflon market where literally nothing sticks. This seems unfortunate, as volatility provides opportunity. But Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York, is more cautious, arguing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent hiccup on the policy front casts serious doubt on the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push forward its ambitious policy agenda.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrapping up for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Adam Gaffney, instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School, has welcomed the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to push through their replacement for Obamacare. He writes: First, it is tantamount to a societal rejection of the conservative healthcare ethos. Second, it may very well open the door to more progressive, fundamental healthcare change in the years to come. Would-be Trumpcare had three main pillars: continue the Affordable Care Act\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (ACA) subsidization of private health plans (though recalibrated along highly regressive lines), shrink Medicaid by about 25% over a decade, and provide lavish tax breaks to the rich. It was thus the evil cousin of Obamacare: it would have benefited the well-off at the expense of the working class and sick, it is true, yet it would also have conserved Obamacare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall organization, and left many of its insurance regulations intact. This last fact played a major role in the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate, for it alienated hard-right true believers in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House Freedom Caucus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Conservatives contended that it would only be by eliminating Obamacare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various insurance regulations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the one that requires that plans cover \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essential health benefits\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 like hospitalizations, maternity care and medicines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that premiums would fall. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his full take on the now-scuppered American Health Care Act. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses have pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest close since Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, on 14th February. So, its lowest point in almost six week - but still much higher than before last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, and the start of the Trump Bounce. Why did Wall Street claw its way back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows? One theory is that investors are deducing that Donald Trump will now push on with tax reforms. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tax legislation done right and done quickly is a big stimulant to earnings and the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that tax legislation will come much quicker than it would have if the healthcare legislation passed is positive, and I think people are grasping onto that as a reason to hang on and buy more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, believes investors are trying to work out the full implications of the healthcare situation. She says (via CNBC): This is coming as investors reassess how bad the news on health care actually is. There are definitely mixed views on that. This could be a catalyst for Republicans to do a better job with tax reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial stocks ended the day down, as did industrial and energy firms. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the Trump trade (betting on faster growth and higher inflation) has faded today. Technology, healthcare and consumer goods makers dominated the risers: Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen for the eighth day running, its worst losing streak since 2011. But.... it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more muted selloff than earlier today, as traders digest the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloody nose over healthcare reform, and its implications for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. The Dow has closed down 46 points, or 0.22%, at 20,550 points. The S&amp;P 500 lost around 0.1% The Nasdaq gained around 0.2% The dollar has also come back a little, but has still lost much of its gains since November. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of photos from Wall Street today: After a rough start, the US stock market is staging a little recovery in late trading. The S&amp;P 500 index (a broader measure of the markets than the Dow) has now erased its losses, having been down almost 1% in morning trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all doom and gloom in the markets. Jasper Lawler, analyst at London Capital Group, suggests that the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to replace Obamacare could spur the president on: The negative reaction to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare setback makes sense but there could be some silver-linings to be gleamed once the dust settles. Trump the dealmaker President will want a success to offset this failure. With its wings clipped from failed healthcare reform, the White House may pursue tax reform that is more likely to survive the rigor of Congress. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff wiped almost \u00c2\u00a311bn off the companies who make up the FTSE 100 index. That sounds like a lot. After all.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking real money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not much in market terms, and still leaves the FTSE 100 worth around \u00c2\u00a396bn more than on November 9th. Charles Gasparino of Fox News points out that the market rally began to fade after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first State Of The Nation address on February 28th. Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have made the dollar great again - the US currency is now a little weaker than on November 8th. Capital Economics have put out an interesting research note, arguing that the debacle over healthcare reform needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scupper a tax reform plan. But only if - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Big If - Donald Trump can build a consensus within Congress for his plans. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, says: The health care bill fiasco doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily alter our view on the prospect for tax cuts. We had already pushed back our forecast of both the potential size of any fiscal stimulus and its timing, so the latest bout of Republican infighting hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed our thinking that we will eventually see a modest $2trn package of tax cuts enacted by early next year. Even complete legislative gridlock wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily be a disaster, however, particularly not when there is evidence of a very strong pick-up in global economic growth. Ashworth points out that George W Bush managed to get his tax reform plan through the House and the Senate - with 10 Democrats jumping the fence to support him. However.... The contrasts between 2001 and now are stark. First, the Trump administration doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a detailed tax plan of its own and frankly, at this stage, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questionable whether it has the expertise to craft its own bill. As with health care, it is more likely that the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role will be restricted to piggybacking on a plan proposed by the leadership in either the House or the Senate.... Second, there is almost no chance of any Democrats breaking ranks and supporting a bipartisan tax reform bill this year. It simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make electoral sense for them to hand Trump any sort of win, not with the 2018 mid-terms now on the horizon. Despite a late recovery, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have ended the day in the red. Worries over the US political situation weighed on shares, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a dip than a full-blown correction. In London, the FTSE 100 has finished down 43 points at 7293 points, down 0.6%. Mining stocks were the biggest fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta losing 4.6% and iron ore-to-coal trader Glencore down 4.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreflation trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, driven by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises of tax cuts and more spending, is fading. Across the channel, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC ended the day almost flat. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed 0.6%, and the Amsterdam AEX closed down 0.4%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market is also coming back from its lows, but still on track for its worst run of losses since 2011..... Connor Campbell of SpreadEx has spotted that the Dax hit a six-week low earlier today, its lowest point since 14th February, when traders were snapping up red roses and chocolates. Dropping around 170 points after the bell the Dow is now trading at its lowest price since Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 love affair with the belligerent blowhard who currently sits in the White House seemingly at an end. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the markets have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccaught a cold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to win enough support for their healthcare reforms - despite enjoying a majority on Capitol Hill. Having overseen a strong rally in stock markets over the past few months the new US president is learning a hard lesson in the differences between campaign promises and the ability to deliver them in a difficult political environment. President Trump is learning the hard way that there are big differences in promising the earth and then being able to deliver it. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either. This is no better reflected in the decline in the US dollar, as well as bond yields as markets start to price out the imminent prospect of a large scale fiscal stimulus plan. Gold has now recovered almost all its losses since November, as traders dash back into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven assets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The dollar has now fallen to its lowest level since mid-November, when measured against a basket of leading currencies. In other words, nearly all the gains since Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election triumph have now been wiped out. Banks are leading the fallers on Wall Street, with nearly every share on the Dow Jones in the red. Goldman Sachs is leading the decline, down 3%, followed by other financial stocks including JP Morgan, American Express and Visa. Ding ding goes the Wall Street opening bell.....and down goes the stocks! The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 168 points, or 0.8%, to 20,428 points - putting it on track for its eighth decline in a row. The S&amp;P 500 has suffered a similar decline, and the technology-focused Nasdaq has lost 1%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for anyone who has been following the Trump Trade; betting on a strong dollar, buying shares and selling government bonds. As in Europe, US traders are showing anxiety over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get legislation through, following the failure to get the Affordable Health Care Act voted through on Friday. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the failure of the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health reform bill is driving a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flight to safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (and out of stocks) today. While the bill itself was to have a pretty minor effect on equity prices, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure has spooked markets. There are now doubts about whether he can get the much more market-sensitive tax and spend legislation through (whatever that is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it will look like). All this casts a pall over the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get any meaningful reform on the move. Same old Washington gridlock, you might say. No pressure.... Lena Komileva of G+ Economics makes an important point -- European financial assets are looking more attractive, as investors fret about the Trump presidency. She writes: It is clear that market risk premia are no longer coloured by relative monetary policy alone, but also by a new regime of international political risk dominance. The contrast between market expectations of an EU-friendly outcome at the upcoming French elections, after Chancellor Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU better-than-expected polling at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local elections at the weekend, versus President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed healthcare vote in Congress and increased US military engagement in Syria, has resulted in markets demanding a higher \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd premium in US assets (stocks, bond yields and the dollar) versus Europe, notwithstanding the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, inflation and policy rate differential. A new four-month high for the euro! Unless spirits pick up in New York, the market could record its longest losing streak in over five years. The Dow Jones industrial average has already fallen for seven days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running -- an eighth loss would be the worst run since longest losing streak since 2011. Oof! The US dollar has just hit a four-month low against the Japanese yen, at \u00c2\u00a5110.09. With one hour to go until the open, Wall Street is still heading for fresh losses as the Trump trade (buy shares and the US dollar, and sell bonds) unwinds. As this chart shows, the UK and German markets are also in the red: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative headaches, and signs that the European economy is picking up, have swept the euro to its highest level in four and a half months. The euro just hit $1.0879, a gain of 0.8%, and the highest since the week of the US election. It came after European Central Bank board member Sabine Lautenschl\u00c3\u00a4ger said the markets should get ready for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in ECB policy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being taken as a hint that the ECB could soon slow its quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme. Lautenschl\u00c3\u00a4ger was speaking at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual press conference on banking supervision, alongside Dani\u00c3\u00a8le Nouy, who chairs its supervisory board. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have been on quite a rally since Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the White House. The Dow Jones, for example, surged by 15% between November and the start of March. But...it has been dropping back in the last few weeks as investors watched the new president wrestle with the levers of power. Yesterday, The Observer argued there are three reasons why the Trump rally is fading: The first is that it may be some time before Trump gets agreement for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It could easily be delayed until 2018. The second is that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitions may well have to be scaled down. Trump wants to use the savings from replacing Obamacare with something cheaper to fund his fiscal boost, but the Congressional Budget Office said last week that the impact on the budget deficit would be substantially less than originally estimated: a reduction of $150bn (\u00c2\u00a3120bn), rather than $336bn. Fiscal conservatives in Congress will probably demand that Trump finds savings elsewhere. Finally, corporate profits are set to be squeezed by a combination of rising wages, higher interest rates and a stronger dollar. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal package \u00e2\u20ac\u201c assuming it is approved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would reinforce those pressures, because stronger growth would lead to greater demand for labour. Sterling has now hit its highest level since 2nd February, as the US healthcare reform debacle continues to drive the markets. One pound is now worth $1.2590, as investors back the UK currency despite the imminent triggering of Article 50 (inked in for Wednesday). Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says investors haev renewed doubts over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get changes through Capitol Hill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The setback with the healthcare bill was not just the failure by the Republicans to vote for the repeal of Obamacare, but the fact that Trump has failed to get a measure even though the Republicans control the House and the Senate, raising some doubts about his capacity to get his programmes passed into law. Markets had assumed that a radical economic agenda could be passed considering the political dominance of the Republicans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere in the markets, South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rand has taken a sudden hit following reports that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief has been recalled from a foreign trip. Prime minister Jacob Zuma ordered finance minister Pravin Gordhan back from an investor roadshow earlier today, newswires say, sparking speculation that a cabinet reshuffle is imminent. One government source told Reuters that Gordhan didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have permission for the trip, to drum up international interest in buying South African debt. But other reports suggest that Gordhan did have a permission slip, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been revoked... Either way, it means the rand (ZAR) is having an even worse day than the US dollar: Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when the market opens in four hours time. The futures markets indicates that the Dow Jones industrial average could shed over 0.6%, or 140 points, at the open: World stock markets could keep falling in the weeks ahead, if Donald Trump fails to deliver on his ambitious promises to boost government spending and cut taxes. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the healthcare bill was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor litmus test\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Trump. So, Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to get enough support for the legislation suggests Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aggressive policy agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd may struggle. Brooks says: Not only does the failed healthcare bill highlight the challenges Trump may face trying to get his other policies passed, but the Congressional Budget Office also highlighted that the savings expected from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare bill would be much less than expected, which could limit the size and scope of his infrastructure spending plan. This is significant for the markets, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trumpflation\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 trade was based on fiscal spending, if there is less money in the pot, then stocks might have to unwind some of their gains since Trump won the election last November. If that happens, then banks and healthcare providers could be hit particularly hard... The Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointment trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is now in full swing. The biggest losers on the Dow Jones last week were Goldman Sachs, Du Pont, Pfizer and Boeing, all companies that were reliant on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy agenda. We expect losses from banking stocks, materials and construction firms, and healthcare companies in the next few days as the markets adjust to this set back for Trump. How he reacts will be crucial, so we will watch his Twitter account with a close eye. A spat with Congress is likely to keep the markets on edge, weigh on stock markets globally and push up volatility. Just in: German business morale has hit its highest level since July 2011 - defying the market gloom this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey from the IFO thinktank. Its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness climate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey has smashed forecasts, jumping to 112.3 this month, from 111.1 in February. Manufacturing, retailing and construction firms all reported that conditions were better than a month ago, suggesting worries of protectionism and trade wars are receding. Money is pouring out of shares and into safe-haven government bonds. That is driving down the yield (or interest rates) on sovereign debt, as investors accept a lower rate of return in exchange for safety. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Failure to pass the Healthcare Bill doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire agenda is in tatters but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge setback all the same and the market mood reflects as much. Bond yields, the dollar, commodity prices and equities are all weaker. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has a good take on the market selloff this morning, and why traders are suddenly more worried about Donald Trump: We often hear the term, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the good, the bad, and the ugly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the markets are only receiving two of those choices today and neither one is good, as investors swallow the bad pill that is Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed health care plan. In other words, it is a perfect textbook trade where if the result is not in accordance with the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations, the markets will drop like a rock. Donald Trump faced yet another setback on Friday when he pulled the healthcare bill from the House, as it was pretty much established that Obamacare is still more popular than any of his proposed plans. The reason for the panic which is triggering market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, which is actually across the board, is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intensity, especially in those sectors which we mentioned a few ago in our special report. Investors are anxious to see if the big infrastructure and tax reform bills will have any shot of making it in the House and if Congress is going to give them their blessing rather than tough time. It is this in particular which is prompting the panic in the market and has everyone running for the hills. The drop in the US dollar has helped to drive the gold price to a one-month high this morning. Bullion has hit $1.257 per ounce for the first time since 27 February. Jiang Shu, chief analyst at Shandong Gold Group, explains (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looks like some people are not happy with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure over his promises and we see that currently there is a very bearish mood about the U.S. dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A wave of early selling has pushed all the main European stock markets into the red this morning: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the 11th hour withdrawal of the US Healthcare bill on Friday night is putting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four-month global Trump trade rally into question\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Splat. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index of leading shares has fallen by almost 1% at the start of trading. The Footsie has shed 64 points at the open, or 0.9%, to hit 7272 - its lowest point in almost a month. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed says traders are reacting to the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fumbled attempt to replace Obamacare. The lesson learned last week is that a Congress controlled by the Republicans doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean the President will be able to pass laws or his negotiation may work in business deals. Unfortunately for him, it seems politics is going to be a different type of game that requires a different form of art. The pound has hit a one-month high against the US dollar this morning. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare woes are dominating traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention this morning, letting them take their minds off Brexit. Sterling has gained 0.6% to $1.255, its highest level since late February. The dollar is also losing ground against other currencies, as the greenback is undermined by the stunning news that Republicans couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find enough support for their own healthcare bill. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are starting the new week on the back foot, after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to shake up America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare system faltered. Investors across the globe are disconcerted by the Republican party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to get enough support for its proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. A crucial vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was dramatically postpone on Friday night, after it became clear that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough support from Republicans. That has left Trump lashing out at his own side, as well as Democrats, and forced financial traders to reconsider the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to force through other policies -- such as his pledge of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Markets are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rattled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the thought that Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the political capital for a deficit-funded tax cuts, says Ben Gutteridge, head of fund research at Brewin Dolphin, on Bloomberg TV a moment ago. Shares have already suffered in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has fallen by 1.5% and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Sent has lost 0.75%. Safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, and precious metals, are in demand, as the US dollar takes a hit. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump Trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- bets on a strong US economic recovery and higher inflation -- are under pressure. And European and US stock markets are expected to follow suit today, adding to last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff (when the wheels started to come off AHCA). Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on the German economy at 9am, when the latest IFO business confidence survey is released. The European Central Bank is holding its annual press conference on banking supervision In the UK, telecoms group BT has just been fined \u00c2\u00a342m for failing to give its rivals fair access to its network, and for not fairly compensating them for delays:",

Economist Jonathan Loynes said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence.</p> <p>Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further.</p> <p>If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy.</p> <p>And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn.</p> <p>For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7636e4b01ea2330bce59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:43:38.329Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound [fell] by 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro after having been in the green before the bell rang on Wall Street. This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime.</p> <p>It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7350e4b01ea2330bce47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:34:34.714Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000.</strong></p> <p>The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably.

                "bodyText":"Breaking! The Dow Jones industrial average has ended its eight-day long run of losses, and avoided its worst losing streak in almost 40 years. The benchmark index has closed up around 0.75%, as Wall Street regained its poise after some nervous sessions. Traders cited the surge in consumer confidence to a 16-year high today, and hopes that Donald Trump will manage to get his tax reforms (tax cuts, more likely) through Congress. Tom Porcelli of RBC Capital Markets says: One of the most fundamental drivers of the backdrop is employment. What we just got from the Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence report should embolden those that believe continued labor market tightening (and accelerating wage growth) is in the offing. Financial stocks, and consumer goods makers, led the rally. The top performer on the Dow was Apple, which closed at a new alltime high of $143.92 per share. And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrapping up. Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting. GW With just 10 minutes to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is on track to break its losing streak. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 160 points, or almost 0.8%, at 20,712 points. Surely nothing can shake the rally?.... Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York, believes improved economic data (such as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence figures) are helping share prices today. He says (via Reuters): This market is driven by two things - the hope of policy agenda getting put into place and improving fundamentals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest coin, and the challenges we faced when trying to use it... Wall Street might avoid racking up its worst run of losses since 1978. The main indices are all in green right now, meaning the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to avoid its ninth fall in a row. Investors are cheered by the news that US consumer confidence has hit a 16-year high today. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also still pondering Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get his legislative agenda through Congress.... Back in South Africa, the rand remains under pressure as investors continue to fret that finance minister Pravin Gordhan could be replaced soon. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no official word about Gordhan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, since he was told to cut short his trip to meet European and US investors and return home this morning. And this lack of clarity means the rand is down 1.65% today at 12.95 to the US dollar. A weaker pound ahead of the triggering of Article 50 on Wednesday boosted the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners who benefit from any slip in sterling. Positive results from building materials group Wolseley also helped matters, as did an early rise on Wall Street after eight days of decline. Meanwhile European markets were also recovering, while oil prices moved higher after problems with supplies in Libya. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.68% or 49.92 points at 7343.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.28% to 12,149.42 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.57% higher at 5046.20 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 1.02% to 20,330.42 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.84% at 10,389.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 664.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.44%. The pound has slipped back further following McCafferty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and is now down 0.46% at $1.2497. Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist says: There may also be some effect from the vote in the Scottish Parliament to call for a second independence referendum. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, is on radio station LBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone in at the moment. My colleague Katie Allen is following the broadcast: A cry of excitement went up at Chapel market as a new pound coin was used to pay for eight tangerines. But John, who has run the neighbouring picture framing stall for more than twenty years, said he was disappointed by its appearance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks like a token, not a proper coin. it seems unfair to me that businesses such as Arcade owners etc are having to pay for the costs of converting machines. That should be a cost that the Government covers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Islington the vast majority of parking meters have been converted to payment by mobile phone only. HSBC at Baker Street was one of several bank branches we popped into to question availability, and where staff said they did not expect to receive the new coin until Friday at the earliest. Even cabbies are up in arms over the changes. Black cab driver Ivan Sobell from Barnet, North London, accepted a new one one as payment, only to find out that it is slightly too big to fit into his coin tube, where he stashes up to fifteen coins at a time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to invest in a smartie tube\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he joked, saying it was the first - and likely to be the last - he had received in a fare today. Coin-operated launderettes - a dying species these days - are also likely to disappoint users holding only the new coins. At the Barbican launderette, a bank of giant washer dryers still take only the old coins, for 19 minutes drying time. Back with our test drive of the new pound coin: At Chapel market in Islington, north London, a busy shopping centre where major supermarkets fringe an old-fashioned fruit and vegetable market, no shoppers had yet seen the new coin and there was no information from retailers informing them of it. A hundred-odd trolleys linked together and locked outside the large Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdual slots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 designed to accommodate the old pound coin and the one euro coin. The new twelve-sided coin fits into the slot that accommodates the euro so there has been no need to upgrade the trolleys. Thanks to the helpful member of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff who came outside to show me and explain to other shoppers. The same dual slot is also in use in frozen food store Iceland. Waitrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trolleys had no locks at all, and the nearby Marks &amp; Spencer had only plastic trolley-style baskets with extendable handles, which are not lockable. But at the nearby Tesco Metro on Islington Green, the trolleys in use had old-style locks which take only the old-style pound and not the new one. Shoppers said they would have to remember to always have an old coin in a handy place. Tesco has promised that it will unlock all trolleys that are not compatible with the new coin, but this store has obviously slipped through the net. Capital Economics suggests that the triggering of Article 50 - finally - could actually give some support to the pound. Economist Jonathan Loynes said: While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence. Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further. If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy. And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn. For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound [fell] by 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro after having been in the green before the bell rang on Wall Street. This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime. It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway. US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000. The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying: Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably. Consumers also expressed much greater optimism regarding the short-term outlook for business, jobs and personal income prospects. Thus, consumers feel current economic conditions have improved over the recent period, and their renewed optimism suggests the possibility of some upside to the prospects for economic growth in the coming months. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The incredible hike in consumer confidence will be a huge boost to US business, with the figures jumping to an unexpected 16-year high. Over in the US, and it looks like being touch and go whether the Dow Jones racks up its longest losing streak for nearly 40 years. After an opening fall, the Dow is now up 25 points although there is a long way yet to go. After the Trump rally following the US election result in November and the expectation that the new president would boost the economy with tax reforms and infrastructure spending the doubts have set in. The failure of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare bill has investors wondering whether he will be able to pass any of his other proposals and the uncertainty is taking the shine off the market, as well as weakening the dollar. But last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery from its worst levels seems to be giving the US market some support at the moment. The new \u00c2\u00a31 coin has passed its last test...it works in the luggage trolleys outside Kings Cross station. The parking meters in Lincoln\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inn Fields near the High Court in London also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the new pound coin. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better news at Holborn underground station; the new coin works in the ticket machines, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve topped up an Oyster card. Car drivers who try to park in Liverpool today will struggle to use the new \u00c2\u00a31, judging by this photo: All you need to know about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a31 coin, in just one minute: Eva Karras-Balint, receptionist at the London School of Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Old Building, likes the look of the new pound coin. She tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gorgeous. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely an improvement. It looks a bit like the \u00c2\u00a32 coin and I like the way it looks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, things take a disappointing turn when we try to spend our \u00c2\u00a31 on a well-earned hot chocolate. The new quid does not work in a hot drinks vending machine at the London School of Economics. It falls straight through. Chris Whittall of the Wall Street Journal reckons the Dow could rack up its longest losing run in almost 40 years today, if it closes in the red again. Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in around 50 hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, as investors continue to digest Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure on healthcare reform. After eight falls in a row, the Dow is tipped to shed a few more points at the open. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says traders are still edgy. Today, US index futures are currently pointing to a slightly weaker open, with European markets struggling to hold onto their earlier gains. So, there seems to be some stability in the markets at the time of this writing. But the lack of any major news or other fundamental events, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little or no reason for the on-going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood to turn decisively positive. Thus, equities could fall back later on today or this week, even if technically the markets look more stable. Put another way, safe haven assets like gold and Japanese yen may remain underpinned. More \u00c2\u00a31 teething problems... You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to make a phone call from a phone booth with the new pound coin - it came straight back out. Slightly embarrassingly, the new \u00c2\u00a31 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on machines at the nearest pub to the Royal Mint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Llantrisant, near Cardiff. According to Wales News, workers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to use the 12-sided coin in the pool table of The Three Saints, or the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy machine either! Wales News reports: More than 300 million of the shiny new coins made at the Royal Mint at it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-security Welsh base were released today. But many vending machines have not been adapted in time - including the Three Saints less than 200 yards from the entrance to the Mint. The fruit machine was altered just in time but the pool table and the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy vending machine is still old-school coins. Hotel worker Jade Davies said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some workers came in last week to work on the fruit machine. They came in especially to alter it so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready for the new \u00c2\u00a31 coin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy machine won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the new coins just yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd South Eastern trains is rather belatedly going to put up signs on cash ticket machines this afternoon to alert customers to the introduction of the new coin. Cashiers in the ticket office in London Bridge had not seen any of the new coins yet (at least until The Guardian turned up with a handful). A customer in her 60s was intrigued and came over to look at the new coin. Pointing to her grey hair, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m old enough to remember the old threepenny bit. it looks a bit like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tracked down Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shiny new \u00c2\u00a31 coin, but found a few problems when we actually tried to spend one of them.... Julia Kollewe explains: We just tried to buy a \u00c2\u00a33 ticket to London Bridge from Charing Cross but the new pound coin got stuck in the ticket machine (at least we got it back). Disappointing! But fortunately this tale has a happy ending... When we tried a different ticket machine we managed to buy the ticket with three brand new coins. Hooray! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not looking very good for South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister.... South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has landed back in the country, having been hauled back from his investor roadtrip by prime minister Zuma. Pravin Gordhan didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too rattled when he met with reporters, saying; The president is my boss so if he asks us to come back, we come back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are many in government who want to do the right thing and make sure we keep our economy on track and keep our development moving in the right direction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rand is still under pressure, though, thanks to those rumours that Gordhan could be sacked today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 1.5% at 12.935 to the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an exciting day for numismatic lovers, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a31 coin goes into circulation. Billed as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most secure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coin of its type in the world, it is thinner, lighter and slightly bigger than the old quid. It also has 12 sides -- which is likely to cause problems with any vending machines that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been updated. The new \u00c2\u00a31 coins also have a snazzy feature - a hologram-like image that changes from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00c2\u00a3\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd symbol to the number \u00e2\u20ac\u01531\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when viewed from different angle. However..The newly minted \u00c2\u00a31 coins are hard to get. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports that: Only certain bank branches had received them by this morning. At Santander in Triton Square, London, only customers of the bank can withdraw the new coins from their account, up to \u00c2\u00a320. So if you find one today, at least you can watch it here: The problems that have dogged Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse in Derbyshire have not been fully addressed, MPs have heard this morning. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee that Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail group have tackled some issues..but many others remain resolved. Turner explains to the committee that: 1) Sports Direct had refused to employ all its agency staff who make up the bulk of its workforce, as the union has pushed for. It is currently moving 10 workers per month onto its books, which means it would take 27 years to complete the job. 2) Those agency staff are still on contracts that only guarantee 366 hours per year, so a full-time worker will have used them up by the end of February. 3) There has been no progress on agreeing collective bargaining for workers at the Shirebrook site. More positively, Turner confirmed that the notorious \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsix strikes and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy enforced by employment agencies has been axed, and Sports Direct has taken its own staff off zero hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contracts. Where an issue has been in the public gaze, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken action, Turner concluded. But where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not, or where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not their responsibility, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not taken action. You can watch the hearing here. Despite Wolseley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, the Footsie has now dipped into the red. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons that traders are getting a touch of Brexit nerves, with Theresa May planning to trigger Article 50 on Wednesday. Beauchamp says: The recovery in US markets last night and a relatively positive session in Asia is not translating into gains for the FTSE 100 this morning, and the nearness of the Article 50 activation is undoubtedly contributing to the air of nervousness. A lack of newsflow continues to bedevil this market, but the rebound off the lows for Wall Street indicates that there is still plenty of buying pressure out there. Other European markets are still up though: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is being supported by Wolseley, the plumping and building chain. Its shares have jumped by over 6% today to a five-year high, after it cheered the City by posting a 25% rise in profits. The recovery was driven by Wolseley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business in North America, called Ferguson, which made up for tougher trading conditions in the UK and the Nordic regions. The firm also announced that it plans to rename itself Ferguson - good news for any of us who struggle to either spell or pronounce Wolseley (I normally plump for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wool-zee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Asian markets have posted solid gains today as investors moved on from worrying about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare setback. The Australian index jumped by 1.5%, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei rose by 1.1%, and there were gains in Hong Kong too. Traders weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too disconcerted by the US Dow racking up its eighth daily fall on Monday. Although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst run since 2011, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the actual decline is quite modest - at just 1.7%. Hardly a Trump Slump (yet, anyway). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump slump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 narrative is an ugly piece of hyperbole. As but one example, the seven consecutive day fall in the Dow Industrials in the week to Friday amounted to a cumulative -1.69%, which is the third smallest 7-day setback in the history of the index. The head of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chambers of Commerce has claimed this morning that Brexit will have serious impact on trade with the UK. Eric Schweitzer warned that four in 10 German companies expect business with Britain to weaken, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should expect further declines in trade in the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, it all depends what kind of deal the UK and the rest of Europe can agree. London mayor Sadiq Khan has just called for an agreement that offers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued fortune and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to both sides. More here: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains why shares are recovering from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wobble: Bond and FX market participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to the failure of the healthcare bill has been to re-price Treasuries and the Dollar under the assumption that President Trump has lost a little of his shine. Equity market participants have taken a look at the lower yields and weaker dollar and decided that since absurdly low rates are the elixir that the equity bull market lives on, they might as well \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the dip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yet again. Meanwhile in the UK, supermarket chain Tesco will pay a \u00c2\u00a3129m fine after coming to a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office over its 2014 accounting scandal. Tesco will also pay \u00c2\u00a385m of compensation to investors who bought shares and bonds in summer 2014, shortly before the false accounting came to light. More here: Separately, two top Tesco shareholders have gone public with their concerns over its proposed takeover of wholesale food producer Booker. They fear that Tesco is paying too much, and might derail its own turnaround plan/. Shares in Booker are down 2% this morning. European stock markets have shaken off Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom, and opened higher this morning. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the best performer, up around 0.5%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has gained a more more modest 0.15%. And the Stoxx 600 index, which tracks major companies across the region, is up 0.3%. The markets are calmer today, as investors ponder if Donald Trump can push through tax reforms, infrastructure spending and deregulate the US economy. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The success of execution on any of these legislations is probably lower now than it was just last week, but investors are still giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt. However, if they see that these plans will face the same destiny as the Health Care Act, markets will soon turn to aggressive selling as the expected companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings growth and pace of economic recovery are not enough to support currently overstretched valuations. According to Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Mkokeli, South African president Jacob Zuma told communist parties leaders that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning to sack finance minister Pravin Gordhan. He adds: Speculation that Gordhan is on the verge of being fired has swirled for months, as he clashed with Zuma over the management of state companies and the national tax agency. While Gordhan has led efforts to keep spending in check and fend off a junk credit rating, Zuma wants to embark on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radical economic transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he says will tackle racial inequality and widespread poverty. The rand has now lost almost 5% of its value since yesterday lunchtime, when news broke that finance minister Gordhan had been summoned home; South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is suffering heavy losses in early trading, on rumours that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister is about be sacked. The rand tumbled by almost 2.2% at the open, to just 13.01 rand to the US dollar. As this video clip of the US dollar-rand exchange rate shows, it was a very sharp move indeed. South African government bonds also came under pressure, sending the yield (or interest rate) on the debt sharply higher. The selloff came after finances chief Pravin Gordhan was dramatically summoned back to South Africa, from a trip to meet investors in the UK and America. This has sparked speculation that prime minister Jacob Zuma might be planning a cabinet reshuffle. The two men have been locked in something of a power struggle recently, with Gordhan resisting pressure from Zuma to raise government spending and borrowing. They have also clashed over an influential business family, the Guptas, who are friendly with Zuma - and accused of wielding undue political influence. Bloomberg reported earlier today that Gordhan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job might be on the line. That helped to send the rand sliding, as the finance minister is popular with City investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. What goes down must come up again. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets to open higher today today, and claw back some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Last night, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones Industrial Average racked up its longest losing streak since 2011, after the Republican Party was forced to pull its proposed replacement for Obamacare. The theory in the City today is that following his failure to get healthcare reform through Congress last week, Donald Trump will be determined to achieve some tax reforms. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: President Trump may have to modify his style somewhat, and add a few chapters to his book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Art of the Deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and work on the art of the schmooze. His belligerent style may work well on the campaign trail but on Capitol Hill it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work well at all. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either, however some in the market do appear to want to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. However.... the president doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be in the mood for schmoozing. Instead, he took to Twitter last night to blame his own side for the healthcare debacle: Also coming up today.... There may be drama in South Africa, after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister was recalled from an investor roadshow yesterday; something that has worried investors. MPs on the Business committee are holding an inquiry into the Future of Work today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from, among others, Transline - the employment agency which suppliers workers to Sports Direct, and which was axed by Amazon two weeks ago. On the corporate front, building materials group Wolseley, betting chain Ladbrokes Coral, drinks maker AG Barr and top-hat-and-tails renters Moss Bros are all reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Perhaps the euro had time to prepare following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak German CPI reading, meaning the currency merely maintained its month low against the pound rather than seeing its losses widen. The flatness of the euro did nothing for the Eurozone indices, with both the CAC and DAX, the latter admittedly at a 2 year high, shrugging their way through the day. </p> <p>As for the FTSE, the UK index was Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer, dropping 0.4% thanks to a wave of red in its commodity stocks.

                "bodyText":"More signs of growing activity from US oil companies, with drills added for the eleventh week in a row. The Baker Hughes rig count showed 15 rigs were added last week, taking the total to 824, which is 374 higher than this time last year. This marks the best quarter for rigs being added since the second quarter of 2011. In all ten oil rigs and five gas were added last week. Brent crude is virtually unchanged on the news, down 0.65 at $52.65 a barrel. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a particularly good quarter for oil prices despite the agreed production quotas for OPEC, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to see why when you look at the rise in the US rig count since the beginning of this year...This return of US shale, and record inventories has taken the edge off any expectation that oil producers will be able to engineer higher prices in the short term. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. It has been a positive quarter for markets but it drifted away somewhat on the final day. The FTSE 100 rose for the fourth quarter in a row, as the drop in the pound following the Brexit vote continued to boost overseas earnings. But a dip in commodity companies as metal prices fell, plus a drop in South African-related stocks such as Old Mutual following the sacking of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, saw the index slip back on the day. The pound meanwhile managed to edge up slightly between January and March after six quarters of decline, while oil fell around 7% during the period. This marks crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst quarterly performance since late 2015, as investors worried that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cuts were being outweighed by growing output from US shale producers. Elsewhere Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax recorded its third successive quarter of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average - despite dipping on the day so far - is on course for a sixth successive quarterly gain. The Trump boost to US markets have meant they have held on to most of their recent rises even though doubts about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to enact his programme are growing, particularly in the wake of the healthcare defeat. Meanwhile, with the US Federal Reserve , emerging markets are also recovering: the MSCI Emerging Market Index has recorded its best quarter since 2012. The final scores for the day in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.60 points or 0.63% to 7322.92 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.46% to 12,312.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.65% at 5122.51 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.61% to 20,492.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 10,462.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.65% to 666.06 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently down 25 points or 0.12%. As the quarter drifts to a close, the FTSE 100 is on course for its fourth quarter of straight gains as dollar earners boosted the index in the wake of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Brexit slump. Despite the gains, the quarter is ending on a downbeat note, with the index currently 23 points or 0.3% lower but the decline may not last into the next three months, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Those hoping for more downside in equities once the second quarter gets underway should beware the impact of seasonality. April, far from being the cruellest month for equity markets, is in fact one of the strongest historically, and over the past twenty years it is the strongest. This time could be different, but given an reflationary environment, economic growth and still relatively accommodative central bank policies, does it really make sense to argue with history? Over in Greece, there is more uncertainty after EU officials ruled out negotiations over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout programme being wrapped up any time soon. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Adding to the intense speculation now swirling around debt- stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to conclude fraught bailout talks in the coming weeks, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem dismissed any possibility of the review being concluded at the next eurogroup session on April 7. The Malta meeting of euro area finance ministers had been mooted as the next deadline for the impasse between Greece and its creditors to finally be broken. Speaking after hopes were dashed that the deadlock would be resolved at a Euro Working Group on Thursday evening, the euroroup chairman told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The review will not be completed at the next euro group. We hope we can approve it soon but that will not happen on 7 April in Valletta.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If Greece is to realistically conclude talks with creditors in time for massive debt repayments to be paid on 7 July, this needs to be done by May at the latest, insiders say. Any additional delay would reignite fears of a Greek default and unnerve markets. But the differences are manifest and myriad. The leftist-led government, which appears to have given ground on demands for yet more pension cuts and tax increases, is determined not to yield on what it sees as the illogical demands of the IMF for further liberalisation of the labour market. Energy reforms and the spectre of additional job losses have stoked deep disgruntlement in the ranks of the ruling Syriza party amid growing speculation of leftist MPS refusing to endorse the measures - and a government crisis erupting - when they are put to vote just before Easter. European markets are edging higher as we head to the close of trading, but the FTSE 100 is still lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 41 points after a host of US data. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was plenty of US data for investors to deal with this afternoon; they just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that interested. The core PCE price index slipped from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month, while personal spending and income fell to 0.1% and 0.4% respectively. The Chicago PMI then rose to a better than forecast 57.7, something that was countered by a worse than estimated drop in consumer sentiment to 96.9. But, as mentioned, none of this mattered to investors, who seemed keen to end the quarter quietly. The Dow Jones trickled 0.2% lower after the bell, taking the index just the wrong side of 20700, but still up from where it was during Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump slump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Considering how soft the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures were this morning it is surprising that the region has been so lifeless. Perhaps the euro had time to prepare following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak German CPI reading, meaning the currency merely maintained its month low against the pound rather than seeing its losses widen. The flatness of the euro did nothing for the Eurozone indices, with both the CAC and DAX, the latter admittedly at a 2 year high, shrugging their way through the day. As for the FTSE, the UK index was Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer, dropping 0.4% thanks to a wave of red in its commodity stocks. The pound couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much with the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent data, holding on to most of its Thursday growth against the euro while giving back 0.1% to the dollar. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commodity stocks were hit by lower metal prices, while South Africa focused stocks such as investment group Old Mutual and packaging firm Mondi were weaker after the sacking of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Pravin Gordhan. Following the weaker than expecting US spending figures, it is probably not a surprise that consumer confidence was lower than expected this month. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer sentiment index came in at 96.9 for March, up from February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 96.3 but below expectations of a figure of 97.6. And now some stronger than expected US data. The Chicago purchasing managers index for March has come in at 57.7, up from 57.4 in February and better than the forecast figure of 56.9. In line with other global markets, Wall Street has edged lower as investors decided to take some profits on the last day of the quarter. The first three months of the year have seen the strongest January to March performance in four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 31 points or 0.15%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened down a similar amount percentage-wise. Still with the US, and new data shows that consumer spending was virtually flat in February, and lower that forecasts. According to the Commerce Department, consumer spending rose just 0.1% last month following a 0.2% gain in January. The February increase was the lowest since August 2016 and fell short of expectations of a 0.2% gain. Analysts said part of the reason for the meagre increase was that the government delayed issuing income tax refunds this year in an effort to combat fraud. The personal consumer expenditures price index excluding food and energy - the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred inflation measure - rose 0.2% in February month on month and 1.8% on an annual basis. This is below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2% but the central bank is still on track for further interest rate rises this year. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for some lunchtime reading, check out this piece on Bloomberg on how financial workers in New York (and beyond, one imagines) are using WhatsApp to avoid compliance checks and share information. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Favorite Way to Swap Secrets Is Against the Rules Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: How encrypted messaging is used varies widely on Wall Street. At the big banks, employees will often use such apps to share gossip, tell clients during morning sales meetings what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to buy and sell (often within sight of their bosses) or even boast about a particularly profitable trade, the people said. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mindset prevails. After betting big on Brexit, junk-bond traders at one of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks crowed about plans for a blowout celebration in a large WhatsApp chat group that included friends from rival firms.... More here: For those of you who want to dig into the details, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some links to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: For the current account deficit: Balance of Payments: Oct to Dec and annual 2016 For the fall in the savings rate: Quarterly sector accounts: Oct to Dec 2016 For the fall in Service sector output in January: UK index of services: Jan 2017 For the latest growth figures: Quarterly National Accounts: Oct to Dec 2016 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the fall in the savings ratio, and what it means for the UK economy: Meanwhile in the eurozone, Mario Draghi might be tempted to enjoy a glass of gavi with his lunch, following the latest inflation data. Inflation in the eurozone tumbled to just 1.5% this month, according to new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figures, down from 2% in February. That takes the Consumer Prices Index back below the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, and means president Draghi might feel less pressure from hawkish colleagues to slow his stimulus programme. However...it may not last. Economists point out that the slowdown is partly because Easter was in March last year, but comes in April in 2017. That means the traditional jump in airline prices, and certain foods, is coming later this year. In another concerning development, the UK service sector suffered a small contraction in January. Services output decreased by 0.1% between December 2016 and January 2017, says the ONS. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only the fourth monthly fall since January 2015. It may show that the dominant sector of the UK economy has slowed a little. Monthly data can be volatile, of course, especially straight after Christmas. In the three months to January, service output rose by 0.6% - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with the average, but does show a slowdown compared to the previous quarter. The ONS blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a slowdown in the distribution, hotels and restaurants component\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Earlier this week we learned that UK borrowing on credit cards had hit an 11-year high; another sign that people are feeling a financial squeeze. With saving on the slide, and disposable incomes falling, some experts fear that consumers are stoking up serious problems. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is very concerned, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures should set alarm bells ringing. The last thing our economy needs right now is another consumer debt crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with wage growth stalling and prices rising, many households are having to rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People raiding their piggy banks and borrowing more than they can afford is what helped drive the last financial crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to set out a plan for how they will protect living standards as we leave the EU. This must include a more ambitious programme for infrastructure spending to create better-paid jobs across the country. And end the unfair pay restrictions for public sector workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group has a theory for why Britons are saving less... The Bank of England may be worried by the slump in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings ratio to that record low of just 3.5%. As the Indie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Chu points out, the Bank had predicted it would fall -- but not as sharply as this! The fall in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit is partly thanks to the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote. The cheaper pound makes imports pricier and exports more competitive, so it should cushion UK firms from the impact of Britain leaving the EU. Shilen Shah, bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, explains: The uncertainty created by Brexit led to some weakness in business investment during the quarter, however the weakness in Sterling did lead to an improvement in the current account, with the trade component leading the charge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dario Perkins of City firm TS Lombard says there are two reasons why Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings ratio has hit record lows: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned by the fall in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings ratio and disposable incomes: Beck says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are worrying signs in the data on the household sector, with a further drop in real incomes meaning that the savings ratio fell to the lowest level on record. Given that this pre-dates the worst of the inflationary pressures, it provides further evidence that 2017 is likely to be a very tough year for the consumer, with little or no scope to offset the headwinds from higher inflation by borrowing more. And given that higher household borrowing was a key part of the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong forecast for GDP growth, there must be a good chance that this will not be achieved, strengthening the case for a lengthy period of monetary policy inaction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bad news! Britains households are saving less than at any time since record began over 60 years ago, as household disposable incomes slide. The UK saving ratio shrank to 3.3% in the last quarter, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows, a sharp slide from 5.3% in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest savings ratio since it started being measured in 1963 (Between the end of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chatterley\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ban and the Beatles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first LP.) The savings ratio is the difference between aggregate spending and income in the household sector, and therefore measures the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income. The ONS also found that disposable incomes fell in the quarter - another sign that households are being squeezed by falling wage growth and rising inflation. The ONS says: The saving ratio fell to 3.3% in Quarter 4 2016, the lowest rate on record. The saving ratio has been declining since Quarter 3 2015 which primarily reflects stronger growth in consumer spending outweighing the rate of growth in household disposable income. Strong growth in consumer spending comes on the back of robust labour market activity, while the slowing in household disposable income growth largely reflects a fall in other investment income from property income. There are also \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctechnical reasons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the fall in the savings ratio, including changes to pension funds holdings. But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying sign: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show how Britain runs a large trade deficit with Europe, and a surplus with the rest of the world. The UK-EU trade deficit came in at \u00c2\u00a319.5bn in October-December 2016, down from \u00c2\u00a322.7bn in July-September,. And Britain ran a trade surplus of \u00c2\u00a37.4bn with the rest of the world, compared with a\u00c2\u00a33.0bn deficit in Q3. The ONS says: This was due mainly to the movements in erratic items widening the total trade surplus from \u00c2\u00a32.6 billion in Quarter 3 2016 to a surplus of \u00c2\u00a313.6 billion in Quarter 4 2016. Good news! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit with the rest of the world has shrunk sharply. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit was \u00c2\u00a312.bn in October-December 2016, less than half the \u00c2\u00a325.7bn racked up in the third quarter of last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly thanks to a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit, the Office for National Statistics says. It means the current account deficit is just 2.4% of GDP, the lowest rate since the second quarter of 2011, and rather better than three months ago Breaking: Britain has cemented its place as the second-fastest growing advanced economy last year. UK GDP rose by 0.7% in the October-December period, the Office for National Statistics reports, unchanged from the earlier reading. That means Britain grew by 1.8% in 2016 - just behind Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.9%, but ahead of other G7 members. The ONS report also shows that Service sector grew by 0.8% - matching the earlier estimate Industry grew by 0.4%, up from 0.3%. Construction grew by 1.0%, up from 0.2% Business investment shrank by 0.9%, up from - 1.0% The ONS says: UK GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016 saw a continuation of strong consumer spending and strong output in consumer-focused industries; there has been a slowdown within business investment which fell by 0.9% driven by falls within the other buildings and structures and transport equipment assets, although this is a slightly improved picture from the second estimate of GDP, being revised up by 0.1 percentage points. More to follow.... UK households are still nervous about their financial situation as the Brexit process gets underway, a new report has shown. The Consumer Confidence Index produced by polling firm GfK came in at minus 6 in March, unchanged from February.. Joe Staton, Head of Market Dynamics at GfK, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers remain cagey about the state of their personal finances and the general economic picture for the UK, especially as wage growth fails to keep pace with the rising costs of living. This chart shows how consumer confidence has been negative since the referendum: Analysts at Barclays think it could weaken further as Brexit played out: We continue to expect overall confidence to soften in the course of this year, in line with weaker activity and slowing real income as inflation peaks just above 3% by mid-year. Confidence with regard to the wider economy could also deteriorate further as consumers begin to register the economic impact of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU, now that article 50 has been triggered and that negotiations are set to start. A separate report has found that British business confidence has fallen this month as expectations for economic growth weaken. The latest Business Barometer from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking showed that 48% of companies were more optimistic about the economy, down by 2 points from last month, while 28% were less optimistic, up by 12 points. That created a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnet balance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for economic optimism of just 20%, down by 14 percentage points. The net balance of companies with a positive outlook for their individual prospects dropped 5 percentage points to 35%. Newsflash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new post-reunification low. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 30,000 in March, to 2.556 million, new figures show. That pulls the jobless rate down from 5.9% to 5.8%. European markets have fallen in early trading, as investors prepare for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth figures and the eurozone inflation reading. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 23 points, or 0.3%, to 7345. South African-focused insurer Old Mutual is the top faller, down 7.5% amid the political crisis triggered by the sacking of finance minister Gordhan overnight. There may also be some profit taking as we approach the end of the first quarter of 2017. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Market weakness may be explained by an element of risk-off into the week-, month- and quarter-end following one of the best starts to the year since 2013. This despite political risk aplenty, the most recent coming from South Africa. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has taken another step towards extricating itself from the financial sector, nearly 10 years after the credit crunch struck. The Treasury has sealed a deal to sell \u00c2\u00a311.8bn worth of loans made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, the building society which was nationalised in the wild days of autumn 2008. The mortgages will be sold to Prudential plc and to funds managed by Blackstone. The proceeds of the sale will allow Bradford &amp; Bingley to repay some of the \u00c2\u00a315.65bn cost of its rescue. Chancellor Philip Hammond says the deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the taxpayer, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sale of these Bradford &amp; Bingley assets for \u00c2\u00a311.8 billion marks another major milestone in our plan to get taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money back following the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are determined to return the financial assets we own to the private sector and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale is further proof of the confidence investors have in the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the task isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete yet. Before today, the government held around \u00c2\u00a316bn of loans made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, and further loan sales are expected before the end of 2018. Is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market catching a spring cold? Prices fell by 0.3% in March, according to the latest data from Nationwide, the first monthly fall since June 2015. On an annual basis (a better measure), growth slowed to just 3.5% - the weakest level since August 2015. With home ownership now at its lowest rate since 1985, this might bring some relief to those trying desperately to grab onto the bottom rung of the housing ladder. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed picture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd across the UK. Six regions saw the pace of house price growth accelerate, six saw a deceleration and one (East Midlands) recorded the same rate as the previous quarter. Interestingly, the spread in the annual rate of change between the weakest and strongest performing regions was at its narrowest since 1978 at 6.8 percentage points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second smallest gap on record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The South of England continued to see slightly stronger price growth than the North of England, but there was a further narrowing in the differential. Northern Ireland saw a slight pickup in annual house price growth, while conditions remained relatively subdued in Scotland and Wales. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments, shows how the market has slowed since last summer: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two fairly interesting pieces of economic data are coming up this morning. At 9.30am, the third and final estimate of UK growth in the final quarter of 2016 is published. The top line, that Britain grew by a robust 0.7%, probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also learn how much of a current account deficit was racked up with the rest of the world. Economists are predicting that this deficit shrank, to perhaps \u00c2\u00a316bn from \u00c2\u00a325bn in July-September. RBC Capital Markets say: The National Accounts will bring news of the current account deficit for Q4 2016 where the smallest trade deficit since Q2 2011 should be a contributing factor to a narrowing in the overall current account deficit from the 5.2% recorded in Q3. New service sector data for January will also give an early hint on how the UK economy began 2017. Then at 10am, the flash estimate for eurozone inflation this month hits the wires. In February, the cost of living jumped by 2% - unleashing calls for the European Central Bank to stop its money-printing stimulus programme. Those voices may fall quiet today; eurozone inflation is expected to have dropped this month, perhaps to 1.8%, partly thanks to Easter falling later this year. A low inflation reading could trigger some euro-selling, as it would suggest the ECB would maintain ultraloose monetary policy for longer. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Last month we saw CPI hit the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target for the first time in four years, however this is expected to slip back to 1.8%, while core prices could also slip back from their current 0.9% to 0.8%. Anything weaker than this is likely to pressure the euro further in the short term. So it could be a lively morning.... Also coming up today Building society Nationwide is warning that the UK housing market is slowing, as it publishes its latest house price figures. More on that shortly. Uk telecoms regulator Ofcom is outlining plans to cut broadband prices, by making it easier for rival operators to access BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superfast network. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets may be lively, after prime minister Jacob Zuma fired his finance minister, Pravin Gordhan. The rand has already taken it badly, falling 2% in early trading.",
