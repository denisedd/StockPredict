After seeing the Acropolis closed by protesting guards last week, Greeks woke up to a 24-hour hour strike by metro, tram and urban rail employees across the capital today. </p> <p>Workers, who will stage a similar walkout on Friday, are up in arms over legislation allowing the cash-starved Athens transport organisation (OASA) to make commercial use of stations.

In a proclamation released at lunchtime, the Panhellenic Doctors Association called on medics in the public and private sector to participate in the mass display of opposition against reduced pensions and increased contributions. The decision to unify pension funds would, they said, only exacerbate the paring back of desperately needed resources for the health sector. At 11%t of GDP, the IMF argues that Greece spends more on pensions than almost any other state. </p> <p>The protests come as Greek officials spoke of a wealth of differences with creditors who this week resumed stalled bailout negotiations in Athens. Acknowledging that headway had yet to be made on the counter measures the government hopes to install to offset the impact of further tax and pension reforms, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told parliament on Tuesday that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed and that austerity was far from over. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31632cc347b5396c4531bdb3928dedbd026b77cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31632cc347b5396c4531bdb3928dedbd026b77cc/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strike causes traffic jams as people take to their cars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strike causes traffic jams as people take to their cars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6d366e4b09c1763ef5106\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:59:41.214Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling is now down 0.7% at $1.2293:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/836937007112802309\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Quite the nose dive in the pound GBPUSD - 170 points off yesterday&#39;s highs.

Based on the harmonised European definition (HICP), and more relevant for ECB policy-making, headline inflation also came in at 2.2% year on year; the highest level since August 2012...</p> <p>With German headline inflation at/above the magical 2% level, new complaints against the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loose monetary policy and new media headlines are likely to emerge; though with little impact on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting. Obviously, increasing inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no matter what the drivers are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c combined with low interest rates leads to even more negative real interest rates and hurts savers. Based on the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main policy rate and headline inflation, one has to go back to the 1970s to find similar negative levels of the real interest rate. At the same time, however, the common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown.</p> <p>First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Developments of core inflation will determine future ECB action.</p> <p>Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low; illustrated by the drop in core inflation.</p> <p>Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Nothing the ECB should do about.</p> <p>Fourthly, the current increase in headline inflation in the Eurozone is broadly in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own projections. As the ECB has often stressed: these projections are conditional on full implementation of QE until the end of 2017.</p> <p>Finally, the ECB conducts monetary policy for the entire Eurozone and not for the best student in class.</p> <p>The German push for early tapering will continue. However, contrary to the situation at the beginning of the year, it seems as if the debate at the ECB has been taken off front pages and media headlines to discussions behind closed doors. Recent statements of German central bankers seem to hint at a slightly changed strategy of the internal critics of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current policy. The partly loud and outspoken criticism has given way to a more subtle tone. Last week, ECB board member Lautenschl\u00c3\u00a4ger even started to praise increasing inflation, only to add that it would enable the ECB to reach its goals.</p> <p>On the eve of the first two important elections in the Eurozone, the ECB will in our view choose not to distort the market with tapering rumours. If and when the elections in the Netherlands and France manage to reduce political uncertainty, the ECB could already give first hints at 2018 tapering this summer.</p> <p>Such a timing would help mitigate ECB bashing in the upcoming German election campaign. It seems that at least German central bankers are willing to keep their verbal powder dry until then.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6cbdee4b09c1763ef50d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:26:04.524Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also expected to open higher and could even breach the 21,000 barrier.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6ca65e4b09c1763ef50ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:24:44.439Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 hits new peak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 has hit a record intra-day high, up 1.24% at 7354.24.</p> <p>The previous intra-day record was 7354.14 on 16 January this year, and the previous record close was 7337 on 13 January.</p> <p>Global markets generally have been boosted by the calmer tone of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, even though there was little new detail on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms.</p> <p>But the FTSE 100 in particular has been helped by weakness in sterling, which lifts the profits of its overseas earners.</p> <p>The pound has been hit by weaker than expected UK manufacturing data earlier, which makes any interest rate rise from the Bank of England unlikely in the near future, as well as an increase in the dollar as the chances of the Federal Reserve increasing US borrowing costs grow stronger.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6c98be4b07c254ae21195\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:16:38.801Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/status/836927647074635777\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">German press cartoonists are already busy drawing wheelbarrows of banknotes, but remember that Q1 2017 may be &quot;peak&quot; inflation o/a yoy oil. <a href=\"https://t.co/mt3JRo4oFJ\">https://t.co/mt3JRo4oFJ</a></p>&mdash; Bond Vigilantes (@bondvigilantes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/status/836927647074635777\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6c797e4b09c1763ef50b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:08:26.261Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/836925124859281413\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/German?src=hash\">#German</a> HICP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash\">#inflation</a> up to 2.2% in Feb (1.9% in Jan) as higher y/y rises in energy (up to 7.2% from 5.9%) &amp; food (up to 4.4% from 3.2%)</p>&mdash; Howard Archer (@HowardArcherUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/836925124859281413\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/836925711676018689\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rise in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/German?src=hash\">#German</a> HICP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash\">#inflation</a> to 2.2% in Feb (high since Aug 2012 &amp; above ECB target rate) will highly likely fuel tensions with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECB?src=hash\">#ECB</a> (1</p>&mdash; Howard Archer (@HowardArcherUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/836925711676018689\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:10:03.705Z\">at 1.10pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b6c5fbe4b09c1763ef50a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:03:37.905Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German inflation hits a four and a half year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German inflation rose further in February, up 2.2% on the year after a 1.9% rise in January.</p> <p>This is the highest annual inflation rate since August 2012 and puts the country ahead of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just under 2%.

That fact didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slip past the pound, however. Sterling has spent the last few session suffering in comparison to the Trump-swelled, rate hike-eyeing dollar, and today was no different, the currency shedding another 0.3% against the greenback to leave it firmly under $1.24 (something that no doubt helped out the FTSE).</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Like their UK counterpart, the DAX and CAC also benefited from a weakened currency this Wednesday.

Export demand gained further ground in February, offsetting a bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth in the domestic market. This is likely to be a sign of things to come as consumer facing sectors are more challenged than other manufacturing sectors as rising inflation eats into household incomes. </p> <p>However, it seems that investment goods will pick up the baton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more confident and busier firms, brighter global prospects and rising commodity prices should create the right conditions for growth in this industry segment. With recent official statistics confirming that manufacturing contributed positively to the UK economic performance in 2016, what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far suggests we should be in for more of the same in 2017.</p> <h2><strong>Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays:</strong></h2> <p>Two months into 2017 and despite a slowing in the rate of growth in February, manufacturers continue to register strong levels of output, healthy order books and growing trade courtesy of a weak sterling. However, despite the recent surge in exports, the sector continues to rely mostly on domestic demand and with price rises feeding through on the back of growing input costs, even with their recent easing, inflationary pressure continues to hover with intent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how manufacturers now respond, particularly in their investment intentions, that will help determine how long the raised level of optimism in the sector continues. </p> <h2><strong>Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said:</strong></h2> <p>There will be fears that the latest PMI data suggests the manufacturing sector is showing the first signs of slowdown since last summer as the UK prepares to begin in earnest the process of leaving the European Union.</p> <p>Yet despite persistent headwinds, principally the uncertainty around future trade terms and pricier imports as a result of the weaker pound, some exporting manufacturers are taking the opportunity to review their international trade strategies and look beyond the EU, especially taking advantage in the short term of the devaluation of sterling making our exports more competitive.</p> <p>Firms are also becoming more skilled at dealing with unexpected geopolitical events. Businesses in the car manufacturing supply chain are waiting to see how the PSA-Opel deal will pan out with elections in several major European countries this year.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit:</h2> <p>While weaker than January and December, this is still a decent survey that points to decent manufacturing expansion in the first quarter. This would follow manufacturing output rebounding a pleasing 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 after declining 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.</p> <p>However, the PMI does point to a slowdown in domestic demand in February. This was partly offset by a welcome pick-up in export orders after a lacklustre January performance.</p> <p>Ongoing very high manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pricing balances remains a serious black mark in the survey that fuels belief UK consumer price inflation is headed markedly higher over the coming months and will likely reach 3% later in the year.</p> <p>The slowdown in growth in domestic orders in February fuels belief that there are mounting challenges for the manufacturing sector.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b68ad8e4b08ddc9a5e4bc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/marksweney\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T09:56:44.738Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ITV suffers fall in advertising after Brexit vote</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, ITV has reported its worst year for TV advertising since the 2009 recession as Brexit fears caused jittery companies to pull budgets last year.</p> <p>ITV said that TV ad revenues fell 3% last year to \u00c2\u00a31.67bn and would fall 6% in the first four months this year as retailers and food companies focus on price cuts over ad spend to win over consumers.</p> <p>However, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest free-to-air broadcaster was able to pay out a special dividend to shareholders of more than \u00c2\u00a3200m thanks to the performance of ITV Studios.</p> <p>The TV production business - which makes and sells shows including Victoria, Mr Selfridge, Come Dine with Me and Coronation Street - helped ITV more than offset the ad decline with double-digit growth in revenues and profits last year.</p> <p>ITV saw pre-tax profits fall 14% to \u00c2\u00a3553m, due to \u00c2\u00a3164m in mostly non-cash charges, while total revenues grew 4% to \u00c2\u00a33.5bn.

Kathleen Brooks at City Index explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The media is focused on the lack of detail surrounding [Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] tax cuts and infrastructure plans, however, the market that matters at the moment - the Fed Funds Futures market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has surged into life since Trump spoke earlier, and is now pricing in a whopping 80% chance of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve at its next meeting on 15th March; just last week this was only 34%.</p> <p> What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triggered the sea-change in rate hike expectations from the Fed? Firstly, the Fed itself. The President of the New York Fed, Dudley, spoke last night and said that the case for tightening interest rates has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153become a lot more compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As head of the NY Fed, Dudley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words hold weight, added to this he is not usually a hawk, so when he is considering a rate hike the market takes note. This was followed by even more direct comments from the head of the San Francisco Fed, who said that he sees a March rate hike getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious consideration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fed members don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just let words slip out when they speak to the press, this was a message for the markets, and the markets have duly reacted.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"979486071f40491867bd7776c9b9b46be4d1a03f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979486071f40491867bd7776c9b9b46be4d1a03f/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Fed president Bill Dudley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Fed president Bill Dudley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Munoz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p> The second boost to rate hike expectations is probably from Trump. Even if his speech did lack detail the President still wants Congress to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure spending programme, something he has a chance of getting through, even if it is a slimmed down version, because Congress is controlled by the Republicans. There was some expectation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans could be delayed for a year or so, the fact the President has laid them out at this early stage gives the Fed the green light to normalise monetary policy to counter-balance a boost to fiscal spending.</p> <p>Of course, there is still a chance that the market will over-shoot and get too excited for a March rate hike that may never come. US PCE data later today, comments from Janet Yellen on Friday and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls and wage data will all be key indicators that could determine if we get a rate hike on 15th March. Thus, it could be a volatile few weeks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b683aae4b08ddc9a5e4bab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:21:33.316Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish factory growth slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector grew by less than expected in February and less than the previous month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/836852324144414721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tl\" dir=\"ltr\">Spanish Markit Manufacturing PMI Feb: 54.8 (est 55.8; prev 55.6)</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/836852324144414721\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But the purchasing managers index was still well above the 50 level which separates expansion from contraction.</p> <p>Manufacturers said they increased output prices to cope with the rising cost of materials such as steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/836852382713712640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tl\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spain?src=hash\">#Spain</a> Markit Manufacturing PMI at 54.8  <a href=\"https://t.co/rC4KwC3wbv\">https://t.co/rC4KwC3wbv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/j09iV32D1Z\">pic.twitter.com/j09iV32D1Z</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/836852382713712640\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:22:15.894Z\">at 8.22am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b6821fe4b05f755cc0d7d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:14:10.330Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected, investors in Europe have reacted calmly to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, with markets on the front foot ahead of a batch of economic data.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.6% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened up 0.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.9% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex are both around 0.8% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b67e30e4b08ddc9a5e4b9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/angela-monaghan\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T07:55:51.551Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK house prices rise more than expected - Nationwide</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>In the UK, there was little sign of a Brexit-related blow to the housing market in February, with prices rising more than expected according to Nationwide</strong>.</p> <p>The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00c2\u00a3205,846 last month, following a 0.2% increase in January.</p> <p>It comfortably beat economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a 0.2% rise and took the annual rate of house price growth to 4.5% from 4.3% a month earlier.</p> <p>Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the backdrop for the housing market was mixed.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>President Trump reiterated that he would help to drive down the cost of drugs, which could knock the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare sector back from its highest level since mid-2016. The lack of detail on financial regulation could also curb some enthusiasm for US banks. The President did not mention Dodd-Frank by name; a regulation that the financial sector had hoped would be scrapped by this administration.

                "bodyText":"Global markets are continuing to benefit from a renewed Trump bounce following the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, while the prospect of higher interest rates in the US is boosting bank shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 245 points or 1.18% at 21,057, while the FTSE 100 has jumped 1.55% to 7375 and is heading for a record close. In Germany the Dax is up 1.58% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.98%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Snimal spirits have taken over. As expected, the Dow Jones has soared through the 21,000 mark just over 3 weeks after breaking the 20,000 level for the first time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the quickest time ever to 1,000-point milestone, beating the record set in 1999. But this looks a bit different to the dotcom boom and bust as we are dealing with a complete reversal in fund allocation in the form of a major shift away from bonds to equities. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boost is all down to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to Congress last night. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rallying call to reignite the American spirit has produced the desired effect on the markets, pushing stocks to fresh all-time highs. Indeed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of Trump that we are here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the prospect of stronger growth, lower taxes, more spending and higher earnings is like a magic cocktail for equities. Of course details of tax reforms will be crucial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is still the scope for disappointment as markets are pricing in a huge surge in corporate earnings. The dollar is also soaring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want as it harms US exporters more than any tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as expectations rise that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at its March meeting. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Unlike the slightly disappointing Markit US manufacturing survey, the ISM report has come in better than expected. The ISM manufacturing activity index reached 57.7 in February, up from 56 in January and better than the 56.2 analysts had been forecasting. This is the highest level since August 2014, and adds to the growing expectation that a US interest rate rise could be imminent. And the first manufacturing survey for February came in slightly lower than expected. The Market final purchasing managers index was 54.2 compared to forecasts of a figure of 54.4 and an initial reading for the month of 54.3. It shows a slowdown from the 55 figure recorded in January. As investors react favourably to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, US markets have followed the lead from their counterparts elsewhere and opened in a positive mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has jumped above 21,000 for the first time, adding 201 points or 0.95% to 21,013 while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.79% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.85% at the open. (This is the quickest time the Dow has taken to climbe 1000 points, having gone through 20,000 only in January) The prospect of a US interest rise this month seems to have increased following comments from members of the Federal Reserve, which has given a lift to the banking sector. The market moves come ahead of the two manufacturing surveys due shortly, from Markit and then ISM. Over in Greece a 24-hour strike by transport workers has unleashed traffic chaos in Athens and put further pressure on the leftist-led government as creditors step up demands for a new package of cuts worth 2% of GDP. Helena Smith reports: As spring approaches, public sector workers are stepping up pressure on prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government with increased industrial action. After seeing the Acropolis closed by protesting guards last week, Greeks woke up to a 24-hour hour strike by metro, tram and urban rail employees across the capital today. Workers, who will stage a similar walkout on Friday, are up in arms over legislation allowing the cash-starved Athens transport organisation (OASA) to make commercial use of stations. Arguing that the law is the first step to privatization, they claim it will ultimately undermine the public character of the transit network and hurt consumers. Protests against further pension cuts have also been announced by doctors working in state-run hospitals with a nationwide 24-hour walk-out planned tomorrow. In a proclamation released at lunchtime, the Panhellenic Doctors Association called on medics in the public and private sector to participate in the mass display of opposition against reduced pensions and increased contributions. The decision to unify pension funds would, they said, only exacerbate the paring back of desperately needed resources for the health sector. At 11%t of GDP, the IMF argues that Greece spends more on pensions than almost any other state. The protests come as Greek officials spoke of a wealth of differences with creditors who this week resumed stalled bailout negotiations in Athens. Acknowledging that headway had yet to be made on the counter measures the government hopes to install to offset the impact of further tax and pension reforms, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told parliament on Tuesday that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed and that austerity was far from over. Sterling is now down 0.7% at $1.2293: In the markets, the FTSE 250 mid-cap has followed the lead of the FTSE 100 and also hit a new peak. The 250 has climbed nearly 0.8% to 18,915, beating the previous peak of 18,864. Back with the German inflation figures, and economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank says the figures are food for critics of the European Central Bank: Based on the results of six regional states, German headline came in at 2.2% year on year in February versus 1.9% YoY in January. Based on the harmonised European definition (HICP), and more relevant for ECB policy-making, headline inflation also came in at 2.2% year on year; the highest level since August 2012... With German headline inflation at/above the magical 2% level, new complaints against the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loose monetary policy and new media headlines are likely to emerge; though with little impact on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting. Obviously, increasing inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no matter what the drivers are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c combined with low interest rates leads to even more negative real interest rates and hurts savers. Based on the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main policy rate and headline inflation, one has to go back to the 1970s to find similar negative levels of the real interest rate. At the same time, however, the common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown. First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Developments of core inflation will determine future ECB action. Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low; illustrated by the drop in core inflation. Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Nothing the ECB should do about. Fourthly, the current increase in headline inflation in the Eurozone is broadly in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own projections. As the ECB has often stressed: these projections are conditional on full implementation of QE until the end of 2017. Finally, the ECB conducts monetary policy for the entire Eurozone and not for the best student in class. The German push for early tapering will continue. However, contrary to the situation at the beginning of the year, it seems as if the debate at the ECB has been taken off front pages and media headlines to discussions behind closed doors. Recent statements of German central bankers seem to hint at a slightly changed strategy of the internal critics of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current policy. The partly loud and outspoken criticism has given way to a more subtle tone. Last week, ECB board member Lautenschl\u00c3\u00a4ger even started to praise increasing inflation, only to add that it would enable the ECB to reach its goals. On the eve of the first two important elections in the Eurozone, the ECB will in our view choose not to distort the market with tapering rumours. If and when the elections in the Netherlands and France manage to reduce political uncertainty, the ECB could already give first hints at 2018 tapering this summer. Such a timing would help mitigate ECB bashing in the upcoming German election campaign. It seems that at least German central bankers are willing to keep their verbal powder dry until then. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also expected to open higher and could even breach the 21,000 barrier. The FTSE 100 has hit a record intra-day high, up 1.24% at 7354.24. The previous intra-day record was 7354.14 on 16 January this year, and the previous record close was 7337 on 13 January. Global markets generally have been boosted by the calmer tone of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, even though there was little new detail on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. But the FTSE 100 in particular has been helped by weakness in sterling, which lifts the profits of its overseas earners. The pound has been hit by weaker than expected UK manufacturing data earlier, which makes any interest rate rise from the Bank of England unlikely in the near future, as well as an increase in the dollar as the chances of the Federal Reserve increasing US borrowing costs grow stronger. German inflation rose further in February, up 2.2% on the year after a 1.9% rise in January. This is the highest annual inflation rate since August 2012 and puts the country ahead of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just under 2%. Higher energy and food costs were the main reason for the rises. But with elections due, the news is likely to see renewed calls in the country for the ECB to call an end to its loose monetary policy. Back with the FTSE 100 and although it has not yet reached its intraday record of 7354, it could hit a new closing high if it ends around its current levels. It is now up 1.13% at 7345, which is above the record close of 7337 achieved on 13 January. With Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Fillon, the conservative French presidential candidate, saying he will stay in the race despite now facing embezzlement charges (he denies all allegations), there has been some reaction: On the rising markets and falling pound, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A resurgent Trump rally gathered pace as Wednesday progressed, the European indices ignoring a mixed bag of manufacturing data. The FTSE barrelled towards a fresh all-time high this morning, rising more than 50 points to lurk just below 7350. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its best price in a month and a half, and one that paid no attention to the fact that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell from 55.7 in January to 54.6 in February. That fact didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slip past the pound, however. Sterling has spent the last few session suffering in comparison to the Trump-swelled, rate hike-eyeing dollar, and today was no different, the currency shedding another 0.3% against the greenback to leave it firmly under $1.24 (something that no doubt helped out the FTSE). Like their UK counterpart, the DAX and CAC also benefited from a weakened currency this Wednesday. With the euro down half a percent against the dollar, the German and French indices were given the green light to go big, both surging 1.3% as the day went on even despite a slight downward revision to the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s region-wide manufacturing reading. This optimism should continue into the afternoon, with the Dow Jones set to open just above 20900 for the first time in its history. The US index actually has a fair amount of data to deal with this Wednesday, including the Fed-favourite core PCE price index and the Markit and ISM manufacturing PIMs. This leaves the Dow in an interesting position \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while Trump is currently the main driving force behind the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements, as the month goes the potential Fed rate-hike in March is only going to gain more prominence, something that could put pressure on the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current highs. Meanwhile sterling has fallen to a near-six week low against the dollar, falling as low as $1.2323 and boosting the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas earners. The currency has been reacting to the weaker than expected UK manufacturing figures - pushing the chances of a rate rise even further into the distance - as well as the strength of the dollar as the Fed does look likely to increase borrowing costs, perhaps as soon as this month. There are also the concerns about the prospect of a Scottish referendum and the continuing uncertainty over Brexit. After an early rise against the euro, sterling is flat against the single currency at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1701. Markets continue to be boosted by the calmer tone of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, along with a - generally - positive picture of the manufacturing sector in February. The FTSE 100 is up 1% at 7336, heading close towards its intra-day high of 7354 achieved on 16 January. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 1.42% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.45%, despite the continuing concerns over the French presidential election. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting an 88 point opening for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dipped at the close on Tuesday after 12 days of rises. Commodity shares were lifted by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeating his plans for $1bn of infrastructure spending, with the Stoxx 600 basic resources index up 1.9%. Building materials group CRH is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 after a 10% rise in earnings. As the largest building materials business in North America, it is well placed to benefit from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending proposals, although it said this was more likely to have an impact in the medium rather than short term. More on the UK housing market following the earlier Nationwide survey. Bank of England mortgage approval figures show the upward trend since the Brexit vote last summer continued in January. The number of mortgages approved for new house purchase jumped from 67,898 in December to 69,928, higher than the consensus among City economist for a gentler rise to 68,650. This was the fifth monthly rise in a row and the highest since last March. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the bounce in mortgage lending would have strengthened the argument for rate rises later in the year if it were not for a fall in annual growth in lending to corporates from 3.2% in December to 2.7% in January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This contributed to a drop in annual growth in the monetary policy committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of bank lending - M4 lending excluding intermediate OFCs - from 6.2% to 5.3%. Nonetheless, we think that supportive monetary policy will ensure that the slowdown in bank lending this year isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too sharp.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jeremy Duncombe, director at Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, said the mortgage aprovals figures highlighted the resilience of the UK housing market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite an uncertain political outlook, it is great to see the industry adopting a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckeep calm and carry on\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach as the mortgage industry continues to serve the needs of remortgagers and buyers alike,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com warned that the strength was dependent on Bank of England support following the cut in interest rates last August. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney and his Bank of England colleagues helped to breathe some life into it by cutting interest rates further and mortgage approvals have stood up very well in January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, this may not continue for long with high levels of uncertainty around Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU far from the best breeding ground for house buying. There has been some slightly conflicting data in the past fortnight regarding the strength of UK housing, but the general consensus is that things are likely to worsen throughout the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the UK manufacturing PMI figures: Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation: The slight slowing in the pace of expansion in UK manufacturing signalled by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI conceals some still positive trends across the industry. Export demand gained further ground in February, offsetting a bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth in the domestic market. This is likely to be a sign of things to come as consumer facing sectors are more challenged than other manufacturing sectors as rising inflation eats into household incomes. However, it seems that investment goods will pick up the baton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more confident and busier firms, brighter global prospects and rising commodity prices should create the right conditions for growth in this industry segment. With recent official statistics confirming that manufacturing contributed positively to the UK economic performance in 2016, what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far suggests we should be in for more of the same in 2017. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: Two months into 2017 and despite a slowing in the rate of growth in February, manufacturers continue to register strong levels of output, healthy order books and growing trade courtesy of a weak sterling. However, despite the recent surge in exports, the sector continues to rely mostly on domestic demand and with price rises feeding through on the back of growing input costs, even with their recent easing, inflationary pressure continues to hover with intent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how manufacturers now respond, particularly in their investment intentions, that will help determine how long the raised level of optimism in the sector continues. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: There will be fears that the latest PMI data suggests the manufacturing sector is showing the first signs of slowdown since last summer as the UK prepares to begin in earnest the process of leaving the European Union. Yet despite persistent headwinds, principally the uncertainty around future trade terms and pricier imports as a result of the weaker pound, some exporting manufacturers are taking the opportunity to review their international trade strategies and look beyond the EU, especially taking advantage in the short term of the devaluation of sterling making our exports more competitive. Firms are also becoming more skilled at dealing with unexpected geopolitical events. Businesses in the car manufacturing supply chain are waiting to see how the PSA-Opel deal will pan out with elections in several major European countries this year. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit: While weaker than January and December, this is still a decent survey that points to decent manufacturing expansion in the first quarter. This would follow manufacturing output rebounding a pleasing 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 after declining 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. However, the PMI does point to a slowdown in domestic demand in February. This was partly offset by a welcome pick-up in export orders after a lacklustre January performance. Ongoing very high manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pricing balances remains a serious black mark in the survey that fuels belief UK consumer price inflation is headed markedly higher over the coming months and will likely reach 3% later in the year. The slowdown in growth in domestic orders in February fuels belief that there are mounting challenges for the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, ITV has reported its worst year for TV advertising since the 2009 recession as Brexit fears caused jittery companies to pull budgets last year. ITV said that TV ad revenues fell 3% last year to \u00c2\u00a31.67bn and would fall 6% in the first four months this year as retailers and food companies focus on price cuts over ad spend to win over consumers. However, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest free-to-air broadcaster was able to pay out a special dividend to shareholders of more than \u00c2\u00a3200m thanks to the performance of ITV Studios. The TV production business - which makes and sells shows including Victoria, Mr Selfridge, Come Dine with Me and Coronation Street - helped ITV more than offset the ad decline with double-digit growth in revenues and profits last year. ITV saw pre-tax profits fall 14% to \u00c2\u00a3553m, due to \u00c2\u00a3164m in mostly non-cash charges, while total revenues grew 4% to \u00c2\u00a33.5bn. ITV, which had warned analysts of the Brexit-related TV ad decline, beat city consensus figures by 3%. Despite the weaker than expected UK factory growth, Rob Dobson at survey compiler IHS Markit said UK manufacturing output could grow by as much ast 1.5% in the first quarter: The big question is whether robust growth can be sustained or whether it will continue to wane in the coming months. The slowdown in new order growth and a drop in backlogs of work suggest output growth may slow further. However, elevated business optimism, continued job creation, a recovery in export orders and rising levels of purchasing all suggest that any easing will be only mild. Indeed, almost 50% of companies expect production to be higher in one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the figures suggested the UK economy should grow by 0.5% in the first quarter. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory activity grew more slowly than expected in February, but is still continuing to show the strong momentum seen since the Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers index slipped from 55.7 in January to 54.6, below the expected figure of 55.6. But it remains close to a two and a half year high. There was a slight easing in inflationary pressures which had been rising in the wake of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump following the referendum outcome last June. And here is Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI rankings: Eurozone factories grew at their fastest rate for 70 months in February, as the weak euro helped boost demand for exports. The IHS Markit purchasing managers index rose from 55.2 in January to 55.4, the highest level since April 2011. It was revised down slightly from an initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: Companies indicated that domestic demand remained solid in a number of markets, while the weak euro contributed to the fastest growth of new export business for almost six years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Euro area manufacturers are reporting the strongest production and order book growth for almost six years, in what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like an increasingly robust upturn. Companies clearly expect the good times to persist. This year has seen firms more optimistic about the future than at any time since the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis. Companies are reporting stronger demand in both home and export markets, with the weakened euro providing an accompanying tailwind to help drive sales. Given the current buoyant demand environment, manufacturers are eschewing political uncertainty and quietly getting on with growing their businesses. The rate of job creation seen so far this year in the manufacturing sector has consequently been among the best seen in the history of the euro. Greece remains the outlier, stuck firmly in contraction territory while all other countries are expanding with the Netherlands, Austria and Germany enjoying the strongest growth. On the price front, not only are higher commodity prices and the weak euro pushing up firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also growing evidence of a sellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market developing for many goods as demand exceeds supply, which suggests core inflationary pressures may be starting to rise. And over in China: There was also an improvement in Greek manufacturing last month, although it still contracted for the sixth month in a row. Still with Germany, and seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 14,000 in February to 2.592m. This is a bigger fall than the expected 10,000 decline but less than the 26,000 drop seen the previous month. The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.9% But over in the powerhouse of the eurozone economy, things look pretty bright for manufacturers. Factory activity expanded at the strongest rate in nearly six years in February, with Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers index up from 56.4 in January to 56.8. IHS Markit economist Trevor Balchin said: The survey results suggest that manufacturing [which accounts for about a fifth of the economy] will contribute to a strengthening in overall economic growth in the first quarter. He said GDP growth in the quarter was likely to rise to at least 0.6% after 0.4% growth in the final three months of 2016. Last year Germany was the best performing economy in the G7, beating the UK into second place. To continue the mixed picture for European manufacturing, French factory activity more slowly in February. The IHS Markit purchasing managers index fell from 53.6 in January to 52.2 last month, down from a preliminary reading of 52.3. Companies raised prices at the fastest pace since July 2011 as they passed on rising commodity costs on to customers. Markit economist Alex Gill said: New business from both domestic and foreign clients..increased. However, rates of growth eased for a second successive month, suggesting a downward trend in underlying demand conditions. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace since December 2015 in February, according to the latest Markit survey. The purchasing managers index rose from 53 in January to 55 last month, and well above the 53.5 figure expected by economists. Back with the US, and expectations of an interest rate rise in March have soared after Federal Reserve comments and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. Kathleen Brooks at City Index explains: The media is focused on the lack of detail surrounding [Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] tax cuts and infrastructure plans, however, the market that matters at the moment - the Fed Funds Futures market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has surged into life since Trump spoke earlier, and is now pricing in a whopping 80% chance of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve at its next meeting on 15th March; just last week this was only 34%. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triggered the sea-change in rate hike expectations from the Fed? Firstly, the Fed itself. The President of the New York Fed, Dudley, spoke last night and said that the case for tightening interest rates has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153become a lot more compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As head of the NY Fed, Dudley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words hold weight, added to this he is not usually a hawk, so when he is considering a rate hike the market takes note. This was followed by even more direct comments from the head of the San Francisco Fed, who said that he sees a March rate hike getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious consideration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fed members don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just let words slip out when they speak to the press, this was a message for the markets, and the markets have duly reacted. The second boost to rate hike expectations is probably from Trump. Even if his speech did lack detail the President still wants Congress to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure spending programme, something he has a chance of getting through, even if it is a slimmed down version, because Congress is controlled by the Republicans. There was some expectation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans could be delayed for a year or so, the fact the President has laid them out at this early stage gives the Fed the green light to normalise monetary policy to counter-balance a boost to fiscal spending. Of course, there is still a chance that the market will over-shoot and get too excited for a March rate hike that may never come. US PCE data later today, comments from Janet Yellen on Friday and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls and wage data will all be key indicators that could determine if we get a rate hike on 15th March. Thus, it could be a volatile few weeks. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector grew by less than expected in February and less than the previous month: But the purchasing managers index was still well above the 50 level which separates expansion from contraction. Manufacturers said they increased output prices to cope with the rising cost of materials such as steel. As expected, investors in Europe have reacted calmly to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress, with markets on the front foot ahead of a batch of economic data. The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.6% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened up 0.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.9% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex are both around 0.8% higher. In the UK, there was little sign of a Brexit-related blow to the housing market in February, with prices rising more than expected according to Nationwide. The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00c2\u00a3205,846 last month, following a 0.2% increase in January. It comfortably beat economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a 0.2% rise and took the annual rate of house price growth to 4.5% from 4.3% a month earlier. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the backdrop for the housing market was mixed. The economy had performed relatively strongly on the one hand, with growth of 0.7% in the fourth quarter, but on the other hand UK consumers might be less willing to spend money in the coming months as inflation picks up. He concludes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our view a small rise in house prices of around 2% is more likely than a decline over the course of 2017, since low borrowing costs and the dearth of homes on the market will continue to support prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although President Trump repeated his pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico, he did not say explicitly that Mexico would have to pay for it, which gave some relief to the peso. But he did attack the high cost of pharmaceuticals again, which could put some pressure on the sector, while bank investors may also be disappointed. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: President Trump reiterated that he would help to drive down the cost of drugs, which could knock the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare sector back from its highest level since mid-2016. The lack of detail on financial regulation could also curb some enthusiasm for US banks. The President did not mention Dodd-Frank by name; a regulation that the financial sector had hoped would be scrapped by this administration. To cushion the blow, however, is the prospect of a Fed rate hike this month, so any decline in US banks on Wednesday could be used as a buying opportunity. Higher US interest rates are supporting the dollar, and pushing the pound lower. Sterling is down 0.12% at $1.2366 although the UK currency is up 0.23% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1728. Here are the expected openings for the European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long awaited address to Congress ended up being more, well, presidential than usual. There was nothing there to scare the horses, although there was not much in the way of new detail in terms of his tax reforms and infrastructure spending plans. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Having built up expectations to elevated levels over the past few weeks the President set himself an exceedingly high bar to deliver, which always suggested that it could struggle to live up to expectations, in terms of additional detail to what we already know. Ultimately that is the key benchmark here, yes the speech was optimistic and Mr Trump did come across as more Presidential, however the speech merely confirmed a lot of the details that had been heavily trailed before. As to the key question as to whether it would come across as more or less bullish in terms of spending and rates there was still a significant lack of detail. This may be more to do with tempering expectations until he puts his final plans through Congress ahead of any debt ceiling negotiations. The speech merely confirmed the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aspirations with respect to infrastructure spending, up to $1trn, while there was little in the way of content about tax policy, though we had been forewarned about that given his comments about prioritising revamping Obamacare. There were no details about a border adjustment tax, though he did reiterate his commitment to free and fair trade, as well as building the border wall with Mexico. Our full report on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address is here: All this served to calm the markets, although ahead of the speech the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower after twelve day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of record highs, albeit down just 0.12%. That meant it has fallen short of beating the best consecutive run of closing highs - 13 days in January 1987. But in the aftermath of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech Asian markets moved higher, with the Nikkei up 1.4% to its best close since February 15. European markets are also expected to open ahead. US interest rates were also in focus after more members of the Federal Reserve suggested a rise could be imminent, perhaps even at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. New York Fed president Bill Dudley, thought of as a dove on policy, seemed to be veering towards a rise, saying it had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot more compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after recent data. It being the first of the month, there is a host of new data due, including manufacturing figures for February from the eurozone, UK and US as well as German jobs and inflation data.",

But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. </p> <p>Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. </p> <p>Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign direct investment-focused economic model.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. </p> <p>Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances would also be negatively affected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b8073fe4b09c1763ef5648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T12:17:31.356Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer McKeown</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued.

This just in from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The indicative opening price for Snap Inc has edged up to $22-$24 a share. Shares in the Snapchat owner have an indicative opening price of $21-$23 a share. So that takes them more than 30% higher than the IPP price of $17 a share. Still waiting for Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price to come in. In the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging app, Snapchat: While we wait for trading in Snap to get underway, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how US markets opened: Dow Jones: -0.04% at 21,108 S&amp;P 500: -0.15% at 2,392 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,896 No new records yet... Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Evan Spiegel and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy have rung the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Excitement is building ahead of Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut trading session on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the company behind the messaging app are expected to soar after the IPO was over subscribed by more than 10 times. After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, Snap has a market value of roughly $24bn. The US President is expected to speak to the Greek prime minister in the coming days. The substance of the call, according to well-placed sources, will be Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing negotiations with creditors and the role the International Monetary Fund may or may not play in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current rescue programme. Donald Trump has publicly tweeted that he thinks the Greeks are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasting their time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd staying in the eurozone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting power, Washington has effective veto power over many decisions. The IMF has yet to sign up to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme, with Germany and the Netherlands saying its participation is vital if further emergency loans are to be disbursed to the debt-stricken country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is attaching great significance to the conversation in its bid to get a clearer picture of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on several issues, not least the Greek bailout program,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Kathimerini news paper wrote today. With tensions also rising in the Aegean between regional rivals Greece and Turkey, Athens is also placing stock in Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventionist powers, diplomats say. President Barack Obama, who chose to give his farewell speech abroad in the Greek capital, was aggressively supportive of Greece remaining in the single currency, stepping in when the country came closest yet to leaving the euro six months after Tsipras assumed power in mid-2015. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Whitehouse chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is of Greek descent, told a visiting Greek delegation ahead of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swearing-in that the new administration was determined to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix Greece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although he failed to make clear whether he meant in or out of the eurozone. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 44-year low last week, beating expectations. There were 223,000 new claims in the week ending 25 February, lower than the 243,000 predicted by economists and lower than 242,000 posted a week earlier. It was the lowest since March 1973, the US Labor Department said, and the 104th week in a row that claims were below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a healthy labour market. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, is hoping to snap up Agent Provocateur. The upmarket lingerie is expected to enter administration on Thursday with Sports Direct the favourite to buy the business out of insolvency proceedings. Sky News reported earlier this week that Ashley had gone higher than private equity firm Lion Capital in a bidding war. Agent Provocateur is owned by private equity firm 3i but the brand has struggled in recent years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00c2\u00a339m last year to reflect its problems and accounting irregularities were also uncovered. Read our full story here: A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is one of the biggest threats facing the Irish economy according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service. Another is the prospect of US corporate tax reforms. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stresses however that Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects remain strong. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior vice president and author of the report explains on the risks posed by Brexit: Ireland has been growing strongly since 2014 and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming years. But the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential. And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform: There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign direct investment-focused economic model. The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances would also be negatively affected. Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. The pick-up entirely reflected higher energy and food inflation while the core rate was unchanged at just 0.9%. Florian Hense, economist at the German bank Berenberg, agrees, and suggests the European Central Bank will not feel the need to tighten policy at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: The ECB will not have to rethink the thrust of its policies. The ECB will be very cautious not to make the same mistake it did in 2011 when it ended up hiking rates in April and July, just a few months before the Euro crisis erupted. Would you be happy to travel in a driverless car? The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gwyn Topham took a spin around East London in a self-driving electric Nissan Leaf. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened: And the story in full: Moving over to Greece now, where the main opposition leader says the government is deliberately drawing out negotiations with creditors and preparing the country for a fourth bailout. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Seven years after it was granted its first emergency loan programme, Greece is being prepared for a fourth bailout, says Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who heads the main opposition centre right New Democracy party. In a wide ranging interview aired on Ant 1 TV on Wednesday night, the politician said prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acceptance of further pension cuts and tax reforms was tantamount to a new adjustment programme that New Democracy would not be backing. This government cannot get the country out of the impasse it is in. We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor. Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago. The government is consciously delaying [it] for reasons of domestic consumption. There is a big danger that entry into the [ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] quantitative easing [programme] will be missed. The spectre of yet more cuts has caused rising alarm in Greece with pensioners taking to the streets. It comes as the Cologne Institute for Economic research says poverty in Greece has shot up by 40 % between 2008 and 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is the big loser,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the think tank said in its latest study on the European economy, pointing out that the increase was the biggest among EU member states. President Trump is awake and tweeting about his impact on markets: The weak spots in the construction PMI survey have helped to push the pound to a six-week low against the dollar. Sterling fell 0.25% to $1.2259 against a broadly stronger dollar. It also hit a two-week low against the euro, with one euro worth 85.90p. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said the outlook for the pound was very much dependent on how quickly Theresa May can push ahead with Brexit plans. If she can trigger Brexit as per her deadline, it may push sterling even lower as this will send the message that Theresa May is in full control and her hard Brexit is taking shape. On the flip side, if she cannot deliver this on time, this could be a positive thing for sterling, and the currency could rally all the way to $1.28, with a potential target of $1.30 a realistic target as well. Earlier the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI suggested activity in the sector grew in February at a similar pace to January. The headline index edged up to 52.5 from 52.2, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Civil engineers reported an acceleration in growth, while growth in housing construction slowed slightly. Construction of commercial buildings such as offices and shops slowed. Firms were fairly upbeat according to Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, but there were reports of weakening demand: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey data highlights that the UK construction sector has rebounded from its post- referendum soft patch but remains on a relatively slow growth trajectory. Weaker momentum in the house building sector was a key factor weighing on construction growth, alongside a renewed fall in work commercial projects. There was little sign that the UK storms had a material impact on construction growth in February, although some firms noted that longer delivery times for roof tiles had added to supply chain issues. Instead, survey respondents mainly cited an underlying slowdown in sales growth, with the latest rise in new work the weakest for four months. Cost pressures in the sector remained at an eight-and-a-half year high, as the sharp drop in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of materials and goods imported from abroad. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.6% - the lowest since May 2009. There were 15.2 million unemployed people in the region, down 56,000 compared with December. Greece has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone at 23%, while Germany has the lowest at 3.8%. Youth unemployment also fell in January, by 198,000 compared with a year earlier to 2.8 million. The youth unemployment rate remains high at 20%. The highest rate is 45.7% in Greece, and the lowest is 6.5% in Germany. The headline rate of inflation in the eurozone rose to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, bang in line with expectations. Eurostat, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office, said energy prices, food, alcohol and tobacco were the main drivers of the rise. Shares in the outsourcing group Capita are down 9% after the company revealed a 33% fall in annual profits and said its chief executive Andy Parker was stepping down. It follows confirmation that the company, which operates the London congestion charge, is to be relegated from the FTSE 100 because of a sharp fall in the share price. Parker commented on his departure: 2016 has been a difficult year for Capita but the Company is now a simpler, more focussed group with a clear service offering and growth strategy, and a plan to achieve a stronger balance sheet. We have achieved a great deal but going forward it is time for a new leader to take Capita through the next steps to renewed and sustainable organic growth. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling nostalgic following the news that the Football Pools is being sold for \u00c2\u00a383m, below is a potted history of the former British staple. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, the pools had 15 million regular punters, helped by an army of door-to-door coupon collectors. The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime, is about to change hands in an \u00c2\u00a383m deal. Its owner, London-listed betting company Sportech, has agreed to sell the football lottery game to a company controlled by funds advised by European private equity investors OpCapita. The conditional sale agreement comes after a near-\u00c2\u00a3100m sale of the Football Pools to its management team fell through in November. The Football Pools dates back to 1923 and has struggled against the National Lottery, but is still popular with about 300,000 stalwarts who spend an average of just over \u00c2\u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum price of \u00c2\u00a33m. The business was formed from the merger of the three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters between 2000 and 2007. The pools will still move into new premises in Liverpool city centre. John Von Spreckelsen, chairman of OpCapita: We are delighted to be acquiring the Football Pools, which occupies a unique place in British culture. Sportech has successfully modernised the business and we look forward to realising its significant growth potential. As part of that growth strategy, we plan to ensure existing loyal customers continue to enjoy the game and bring the Football Pools, already loved by so many, to an even wider audience. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst, at ETX Capital, says Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut in New York coincides with a period of bullishness among investors: Snap shares look set to fly when they begin trading in New York today after being priced at $17, above its target range. With the Dow closing above 21,000 for the first time the IPO comes at an incredibly bullish point for US, and indeed global, equities. Of course such bullishness is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble and this could be a high watermark for the market. The offer was 10 times over-subscribed, making a strong case for the stock to pop on the open. Big institutional funds will step in to the main market to add to their holdings, forcing up the price. Lessons to be learned from Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen huge retail client interest in Snap shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is as big as the Facebook IPO in terms of the hype and buzz around it. But trading in Snap shares could be choppy today. It could be pricing high and selling low. Facebook again is instructive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it endured a rocky start to life on the public markets, sliding from its IPO price before turning things around. Of course its IPO was beset by technical problems that the US exchanges are keen to avoid this time. There is also a sense that the shares could be overpriced, based on some key fundamentals. Shares in Snap, the American technology company behind the messaging app Snapchat, will start trading in New York today. Shares are expected to soar after it raised $3.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.9bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, above its price expectations. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO was over-subscribed by more than 10 times, suggesting demand for shares will be strong when trading gets underway. Reuters notes: After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, the owner of the popular disappearing-message app has a market value of roughly $24 billion, more than double the size of rival Twitter Inc and the richest valuation in a US tech IPO since Facebook five years ago. The share sale was the first test of investor appetite for a social-media app that is beloved by teenagers and people under 30 for applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies, but has yet to convert \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into cash. The FTSE 100 might only be up 4 points or 0.1% at 7,387 but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new record high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are on a high following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending pledges despite the fact the President has yet to provide any detail. Equities analysts and strategists including myself have been arguing for some time that if no further details were provided on how and when the proposed US tax reforms and spending plans will take place, the market rally should take a pause. However, US President Donald Trump provided no new details in his speech to Congress on Tuesday, and yet, stocks surged to new highs. He also points out that rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month are also driving shares higher... usually such expectations would have the opposite effect as investors remain hooked on stimulus as the hangover from the financial crisis persists. Sayed says: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more interesting is markets now consider a tighter monetary policy a sign of confidence in economic growth and thus a reason to continue purchasing stocks, when for years post 2008 crisis it had been considered the most significant motive to dump stocks. Does the market rally have legs? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that improved economic conditions, consumer confidence, and higher inflation will all lead to higher earnings growth, but what markets are currently pricing in is more than just these factors. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly about tax reforms, and assuming a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax from 35% to 20%, although difficult to calculate its impact on earnings, is expected to lift net profits from 10% to 15%, and this is what investors are betting on. If you still want to ride the current bullish momentum wave, pray that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reduction plan succeeds as soon as possible. The spotlight is on key elections coming up in Europe and all bets are off following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock Brexit vote and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to install Donald Trump in the White House. Could the Netherlands deliver the next surprise? Here is a useful guide to the Dutch elections on 15 March: As markets settle following a record-breaking run, investors await the flash eurozone inflation rate for February, to be published at 10am. If economists polled by Reuters get it right, and the headline rate rises to 2% from 1.8% in January, Mario Draghi is likely to come under renewed pressure over the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Specifically, pressure could build on the president of the ECB to announce policy tightening at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the governing council. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the figure and reaction when it comes. The FTSE 100 is up slightly this morning, rising 0.1% or four points to 7,387. Elsewhere in Europe major markets are up with the exception of Spain. German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.03% at 12,071 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 4,9781 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.01% at 19,367 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.04% at 9,748 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 376 The FTSE 250, which is more domestically focused on the UK than the FTSE 100, is down 0.1% at 18,961. Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning today. In a pretty gloomy report on poverty, inequality, and living standards, the thinktank says household incomes will not grow at all over the next two years. On average, by 2021-22, families will be \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year worse off than they might have reasonably expected back in 2007-08 before the financial crisis took hold. Inequality and child poverty are also expected to rise over the next five years as a direct result of government policies. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at IFS, explains: Weak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts means that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 as it was back in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08. In the decade before that, it fell by a third. Tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament explain all of the projected increase in absolute child poverty between 2014\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 and 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22. A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the report: We are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the National Living Wage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this Parliament. Here is our full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to go on a major spending spree drove a surge in investor optimism, pushing indices on both sides of the Atlantic to fresh record highs on Wednesday. Asia followed Wall Street higher this morning with the Hang Seng and Nikkei both just about in positive territory. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson has this take on investor mood: Records tumbled one after the other yesterday as equity markets across the world went on a tear in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to spend up to $1trn on rebuilding the infrastructure of the United States, with the FTSE100 and FTSE250 both making an closing at new record highs, as the reflation trade took another leg higher. US markets also surged with the Dow opening above 21,000 and the S&amp;P500 also hitting new record highs above 2,400, as markets posted their best one day gain of 2017. Also coming up day we have the flash estimate of eurozone inflation which is expected to show a pick up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, potentially causing problems for Mario Draghi. We also have eurozone unemployment. In the UK we have the latest snapshot of construction from the PMI survey for February. And over in the US we have weekly jobless claims figures. We will be bringing you all the latest developments as the day unfolds.",

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and come back tomorrow for our coverage of the UK budget. Snap, the parent of Snapchat, made an explosive debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week. Shares in the business soared 44% from their initial $17 on Thursday, the first day of dealing, and added another 10% a day later in heavy trading. But since then the shares have dropped, falling 12% on Monday and another 11% so far on Tuesday to around $21. Most analysts have been negative on the stock with four out of six analysts recommending selling the shares, and the other two having a neutral rating. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Although [Snap] remains well above the $17 IPO price, momentum has turned ugly. The question is whether this is early investors locking in profits, or whether this heralds a move to a more realistic valuation for this hyped, but risky, early-stage stock. Back with the appointment of Charlotte Hogg as deputy governor of the Bank of England after it emerged she had not told the bank her brother worked at Barclays, prompting a potential conflict of interest. After a critical Treasury committee hearing earlier, the chair of the committee Andrew Tyrie has issued a statement: The Committee now needs to digest the evidence it has heard today, some of which has been a surprise to a number of us. It will offer a view after a period of reflection. The committee said it would return to the matter after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. One Labour MP, John Mann, has already called for Hogg to resign over the issue. Given the tensions over the US trade deficit with Germany, this could be interesting: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk of cracking down on drug pricing has also unsettled European pharmaceutical companies. Novartis is down 1.7%, Roche has fallen 1.23%, Shire has lost 2.2%, while AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline are both almost 1% lower. President Trump has been at it again. A tweet suggesting plans to cut drug prices has hit pharmaceutical shares and helped push Wall Street lower at the open: So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 33 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.17% lower and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.21%. Pfizer is down 1.3% while Merck is 1.5% lower. Will any European countries end up leaving the eurozone? Apart from Greece, the chances are low, according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but could get higher. In a new report, it said: The likelihood of a country other than Greece leaving the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single currency area remains very low, but has the potential to increase materially this year given the rise of anti-EU political parties in the region. While it is unlikely that any of these parties will gain sufficient electoral support to seek a mandate for exit from the euro area in the near future, they can still influence political agendas, potentially weakening support for euro area membership... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aside from Greece, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believes that the likelihood of a country leaving the euro area remains very low,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Colin Ellis, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Credit Officer for EMEA and the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-author. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, this probability could increase over coming months, depending on the results of upcoming elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Any exit from the European single currency would be an existential moment for the euro area: it would demonstrate conclusively that the currency union was not indivisible. A country leaving the euro area and redenominating its currency would not necessarily automatically result in a default, however. In that situation, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would in particular focus on any change in the financial value of debt obligations relative to the original contractual promise. Over to the US and - in news which will not please Donald Trump - the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in January widened to its highest level since March 2012. With rising oil prices pushing up the cost of imported fuel, the trade gap increased 9.6% to $48.5bn compared to the December figure of $44.3bn, according to the Commerce Department. Trump sees trade as one of the key areas to tackle, and has already said he will pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement. Exports to the European Union fell 7.3%, and Trump advisors have already hit out at Germany for benefiting from a weak euro. The trade deficit with the United Kingdom rose from $457m to $609m. Meanwhile the deficit with China, another contentious area for Trump, rose by 12.8% to $31.1bn in January. But the trade deficit with Mexico - where Trump has continued to push plans for a border wall - fell 10.1% to its lowest level since July 2015. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-disclosure, which sparked such a rumpus at the Treasury committee today: Newsflash: John Mann MP has declare that Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as deputy governor is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now untenable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, following her admission that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare that her brother hold a senior role in Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategy team. In a statement just released, Mann MP argues that Hogg has failed to meet the principles of public life, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nolan principles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a point he made during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing). Mann says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is simply incredible that such a senior person at the Bank of England has behaved in such in this manner. Last week Charlotte Hogg proudly told this committee that she actually wrote the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct which she has now admitted to repeatedly breaking it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only has she compromised her current position and the Bank of England itself but more importantly she has failed under the key principles of the Nolan standards in public life and she has no excuse for doing so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is simply a question about standards in public life and in this regard she has failed and must resign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can watch the entire Treasury Committee hearing about Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-declaration here. Andrew Tyrie wraps up the hearing by saying that we are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking at a mistake, a series of mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We need to examine if the response from the bank has been proportionate. There are three issues to discuss, Tyrie argues: Whether, and to what extent, we can ensure this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t become a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo what I say, not what I do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a very serious member of the Bank Need to protect the reputation of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Committee, which oversees UK banks What it says about the role of the Court in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance. Tyrie concludes by telling Anthony Habgood and Bradley Fried that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news about Charlotte Hogg has been a surprise to a number of committee members, including himself, and they must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153think very carefully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about it. Charlotte Hogg has also officially recorded her family links to the Hoare family -- who created Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest private bank, Habgood says. Q: Have any other senior Bank of England staff updated their declarations under the code of conduct since Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s omission came to light? Anthony Habgood says that several people have, yes, including one who has added that his daughter is a political journalist. Deputy court chairman Bradley Fried now hits back at the suggestion that Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct has fallen below acceptable standards. Despite this lack of disclosure over her brother, I believe she is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superb public servant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Fried. His personal view is that Hogg does meet standards of the best of public life laid out in the code. We are living with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointment and aggravation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of her non-disclosure right now, Fried adds. And he suggests this affair will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153watershed moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career, and also in the way that senior Bank executives report any potential conflicts of interest. Scottish Nationalist Party MP George Kerevan reads out the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct. Q: The code of conduct on interests says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living within our code is not simply about observing the letter of the policies referred to. We aspire to set an example of the best in public service.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By that test, has Ms Hogg failed it? BoE Court chairman Anthony Habgood replies that She has omitted something that she should not have omitted, that is important, so she has not lived up to that code. Q: So do you stand by the code? Absolutely we stand by the code, Habgood adds. Q: What effect will her non-compliance have on the rest of the bank staff, and the way they see the code? We will push the code harder, Habgood says, but it is hard as it relies on self-assessment. For example, someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second son might move from a non-regulated City firm to a regulated one - so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need to update their records. We have moved a long way from a few years ago, when the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have a code of conduct, Habgood adds (somewhat alarmingly!) Tory MP Kit Malthouse is concerned that the Bank of England doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what Quintin Hogg does at Barclays. He could even be targeted with handling Barclay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy towards the Bank of England, Malthouse suggests. We could find out, Habgood concedes. But even if that were the case, he thinks it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have affected Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suitability to be deputy governor. Now the committee ask about social ties between the top brass at the Bank of England. Court chairman Anthony Habgood insists that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had no social interaction with Charlotte Hogg -- beyond one trip to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something to do with ballet for youthful people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her until just before I came to the bank. But Habgood then reveals other ties to the Hogg dynasty. I know her mother better than I know her because she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been chairman of various things when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been chairman of various things. Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother is Sarah Hogg, the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company (3i, back in 2002). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s married to Douglas Martin Hogg, son of the late Lord Hailsham, and a former Tory MP (until his expenses claim for moat-cleaning came to light...) Fried adds: Anthony [Habgood]and I are fans of Charlotte. We think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a distinctive professional. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse wants to know what the Court of the Bank of England (the board of the central bank) is going to do about Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breach of the code. Deputy chairman Bradley Fried says the situation will be discussed. Clearly we have an issue now around optics. We hope that it can be resolved. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an issue how we feel individually. We will discuss it in full Court. Chairman Anthony Habgood then weighs in, saying they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to recommend reversing Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment as deputy governor of the BoE. Why not, asks Tyrie? Because the process of having Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s line manager (Mark Carney), and the head of HR looking into the issue has been concluded, Habgood explains. Earlier in this hearing, deputy court chairman Bradley Fried said Hogg had committed an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwillful act of omission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I definitely don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hanging offence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fried told Parliament Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terribly unfortunate. It warrants grumpiness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anthony Habgood says he has discussed the situation with governor Mark Carney -- apparently it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revelation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Carney that Charlotte Hogg hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declared her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie wants more answers from BoE chairman Anthony Habgood. Q: How many breaches of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct are there? Habgood doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. I think it might be helpful to know, Tyrie points out. Q: What are the sanctions for failing to make a voluntary declaration? It depends on the seriousness of it, Habgood says. In most cases, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect that the line manager and the HR department would speak to the individual and take a view. Q: So why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Charlotte Hogg declare her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a Barclays strategy director when she was hired as chief operating officer in 2013? Habgood insists that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wilful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decision. He suggests that Hogg didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that her brother was in a position where it mattered - which was a mistake as she she shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take that decision. It was also an issue of priorities but it should have been high up her list of priorities as Charlotte Hogg helped develop the codes, Habgood points out... Labour MP John Mann is now laying into the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass -- comparing Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct to MPs who were jailed in the expenses scandal. The standards of public life are about ethics and public responsibility, Mann insists. He demands to know who is going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hogg for not declaring her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays back in 2013. Mann tells BoE Court chairman Anthony Habgood that: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broken the standards in public life....and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done nothing about it.... You must see that the independence of the Court is being brought into question. Habgood says any sanction is the responsibility of her line manager, governor Mark Carney. And he points out that Hogg did declare her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role to the committee in her written submission last month (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online here). The problem, though, is that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare it back in 2013 when she joined the Bank. Habgood says: The standard is broken, that is correct. But he argues that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblack and white\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issue -- the Court must consider a range of factors (Hogg is highly regarded at the BoE). And there is definitely no personal gain here, Habgood insists. The Treasury Committee are laying into the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass over Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to declare that her brother works for Barclays. Jacob Rees-Mogg (who knows a thing or two about high society), is challenging the idea that there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a conflict of interest, actual or potential. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of people in the City called Quintin Hogg, points out Rees-Mogg. He adds: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying me is that the bank and the Court is pretty complacent about this. It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been wrong because we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have behaved like that. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t investigate it - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no conflict because the brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably like us, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another good chap. Rees-Mogg is also unimpressed that Anthony Habgood doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to actually know what Hogg. Q does at Barclays. Deputy chairman Bradley Fried hits back at the suggestion that the Bank is a cushy institution where family background counts for a lot. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply forensic, fact-based institution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he insists. Now this is awkward.... Charlotte Hogg, the newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England, has admitted that she failed to disclose that her brother works for Barclays Bank. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear, and highly embarrassing, breach of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct. Last month, Hogg told MPs Treasury Committee that she had reported her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a strategy director at Barclays to the Bank, when she joined as its chief operating officer in 2013. But now, in a letter to the Treasury Committee released this morning, Hogg admits that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: During my appointment hearing on 28 February 2017,1 was asked by you and other members of the Committee about my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as Director, Group Strategy at Barclays Bank pic. Following my hearing, I checked the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s records of the interests and relationships that I had declared prior to joining the Bank in July 2013 and subsequently. I had not formally declared my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays Bank pic to the Bank. The first time that I formally outlined my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role was when I noted it in the questionnaire which I submitted to the Committee in advance of my recent hearing. As Barclays Bank pic is regulated by the PRA, under the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal code of conduct and personal relationships policy, I should have formally declared my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role when I first joined the Bank. I did not do so and I take full responsibility for this oversight. I have now added a full record of my brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HR systems. Regrettably, my oversight means that my oral evidence to the Committee in this respect was not accurate. I write now to correct that evidence at the earliest opportunity and to place on record my sincere apologies to the Committee. Hogg adds that the Secretary of the Bank and the Chaiman of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court of Directors, Anthony Habgood, agree that there has not been any actual or potential conflict of interest. But Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury committee, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed at all. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quizzing Habgood about the issue now in parliament. Tyrie argues that this relationship becomes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more serious issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd now that Hogg has been promoted to deputy governor. And doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this breach show how seriously the Bank does (or doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) take its approach to compliance? Habgood agrees that this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very serious breach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compliance code.... Economics blogger Tim Worstall has a good take on the German factory orders decline, on Forbes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Reading too much into just the one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers is not a sensible thing to be doing so the answer to that headline question, as Betteridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Law says it should be, is probably no. However, when matters do turn against the German economy this is the sort of thing that we would expect to see. We all know, or at least we all should know, that the German economy is rather different from those of other advanced countries. It has about double the manufacturing of those others and that manufacturing is rather more concentrated into durable goods than most others. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thus vulnerable to a slow down in investment in other economies... More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad morning for hundreds of workers at Budgens stores across the country. Some 34 Budgens stores are closing after administrators failed to find a buyer for their owner, Food Retailer Operations Limited (FROL). These stores employ around 815 workers. However (and contrary to some reports), this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the entire Budgens chain is toast. Instead, around 150 other outlets are still in business. Charles Wilson, chief executive of Booker, told my colleague Julia Kollewe that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The business is performing very strongly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Budgens stores are usually run by independent retailers, while the brand is owned by Bookers -- which is being taken over by Tesco. Breaking: The OECD thinktank has just become the latest organisation to admit that it overestimated the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK economy. The Paris-based group now expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP to rise by 1.6% this year, up from 1.2% previously. My colleague Katie Allen says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. The new forecasts envisage the UK economy performing in line with the eurozone economy, where GDP is also expected to expand by 1.6% in 2017. The US economy, helped in part by an expected rise in spending under Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration, is forecast to grow 2.4% this year. The OECD still has concerns about the UK economy, and is warning that inflation will hurt growth. More here: The news that UK house price growth has hit its lowest level since July 2013 has disappointed some economists. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts that the market will be muted in 2017: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight rise in house prices reported by the Halifax fuels our belief that house price gains over 2017 will be no more than 3% and could well be less. Weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios are likely to weigh down on house prices. However, a shortage of supply is likely to put a hard floor under prices. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says potential buyers are being cautious: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest data reflects the cautious nature of the market; with value sensitive buyers remaining committed to their moving plans, but only at the right price. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading for a crash: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too soon to make a call on whether the property market is cooling off. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible this is a sign of things to come demand is still so high and supply so lacking so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a dramatic slump on the horizon quite yet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Affordability is a major issue and if rising inflation means households are strapped for cash getting onto or moving up the ladder will be more difficult and that will impact prices. The changes to tax on rental properties have also meant more would-be landlords are holding back from buying too which has an effect. Rob Weaver, Director of Investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner, thinks the lack of housing supply will keep propping prices up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite continuing uncertainty, a buoyant jobs market, record low interest rates and the imbalance between high demand for homes and a severe shortage in supply continue to put upward pressure on prices. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house market appears to be weakening, with prices growing at their weakest rate in over three years. Prices rose by an annual rate of 5.1% in the three months to February, according to the Halifax building society. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 5.7% the previous month, and the weakest rate since July 2013. In February alone, prices inched up by 0.1% - weaker than the 0.4% expected by City economists. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin Ellis predicts that price growth will keep falling, bringing it closer to wage growth. Ellis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A sustained period of house price growth in excess of pay rises has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home. This development, together with signs of reduced momentum in the jobs market and squeezed consumer spending power, is expected to curb house price growth during 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These factory orders numbers are rather weaker than other German data, points out Bloomberg: Ifo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index improved in February amid strong activity in manufacturing and services, and unemployment continued to decline. And last week, we got very decent PMI figures suggesting that German factories were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchumming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in March.. Even if you strip out orders for expensive transport equipment, German factories had a bad January: Financial analysts are concerned by the scale of the drop in German factory orders at the start of 2017. Carsten Brzeski at ING says the 7.4% slide is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing data is also a good reminder that the German industry is having more problems returning to full speed than buoyant sentiment indicators have been suggesting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet points out that demand for large machinery and expensive equipment (known as capital goods) fell particularly rapidly Claus Vistesen of Pantheon says the figures are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchorrible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to read too much into a single month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Andreas Wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m of Nordea Markets provides more context: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has suffered a surprisingly sharp fall in orders, raising concerns that its economy may not be as robust as thought. Orders for German factory goods plunged by 7.4% in January, compared to December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than the 2.5% drop which analysts expected. The dropoff appears to have been driven by a decline in orders within Germany itself. This domestic demand fell by 10.5%. Foreign orders slid by 4.9% -- including a 7.8% fall in demand from the euro zone. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great signal for the euro area, which had shown signs of more robust growth recently. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read TOO much into one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data -- especially as the German factory orders report is notoriously volatile... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry is urging calm, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weak start to the year should be manageable. Business confidence in manufacturing is significantly brighter than the long-term average, so that a revival in manufacturing can still be expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Consumer spending has been propping the UK economy up since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. But there are now signs that the retail sector is feeling a chill. A new survey this morning shows that retail sales slid by 0.2% in the three months to February, compared with a year earlier. Non-food sales are dropping for the first time in five years, suggesting consumers are tightening their belts as the economy slows. Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium, which compiled the report, warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tougher times are expected ahead. The impact of inflation on consumer spending will add further intensity to an already fiercely competitive environment in which the ability to adapt and innovate will be key to survival.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Faced with slowing sales, retailers are now pleading with the government to rethink its business rates changes - perhaps as soon as in tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget? Also coming up today..... We get a new healthcheck on the global economy at 10am GMT, with the latest forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The car industry has flocked to Geneva for the annual Motor Show, where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be showing off new models and concept cars. Closer to home, Vauxhall car workers will be thinking about the future after being sold by General Motors yesterday. PSA Group, their new owners, has promised that job cuts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inevitable. But although Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two UK plants are relatively efficient, they could still lose out. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton will have to battle with Peugeot, Citro\u00c3\u00abn, and Opel plants across Europe to win the right to produce vehicles beyond 2021. The future of Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sites is secure until then because PSA Group, which has bought Vauxhall and Opel from General Motors, has pledged to recognise existing production commitments. Ellesmere Port is scheduled to produce the Astra until 2021 while Luton will make the Vivaro van until 2025. However, PSA will have to make a decision on where to produce the next-generation Astra from 2021 as early as next year, and Ellesmere Port faces a significant challenge to win the work and secure its survival.... More here: European stock markets are expected to rally a little, pushing the FTSE 100 back towards last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. On the corporate news front, bookmaker Paddy Power, online food delivery form Just Eat and insurance firm Direct Line are reporting results. And Halifax are scheduled to release their latest UK house price figures, at 8.30am GMT. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

This is effectively him signalling that something might change in the future, just not today.</p> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a classic Draghi technique of saying something that will move markets without actually doing anything.

Now we tend to see a willingness for central banks, including the Bank of England, the ECB and, to a smaller extent, the Federal Reserve, to look through periods of high inflation in order to protect growth. Thus, the fact that headline CPI reached 2% is unlikely to deter the ECB from keeping rates in negative territory and maintaining asset purchases, potentially into 2018. We do expect the ECB to revise up its long-term inflation forecast at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, which could trigger some euro buying as the market anticipates a premature end to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme.</p> <p>We also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the ECB to announce any plans to taper its asset purchases any time soon. Firstly, growth in the region remains uneven, for example, the Greek economy contracted sharply at the end of 2016, Finnish growth was flat and Italy could only muster growth of 1%. These are economies that need support from their central bank, and even the German finance minister in a recent speech noted that the ECB was doing a good job to balance policy for all Eurozone members.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the ECB press conference. The European Central Bank reported signs of an improving eurozone economy Thursday, but said it would keep cheap money gushing for fear of undermining the recovery. ECB watchers were alert for any tightening of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose policy as inflation rates rise and prospects for growth in the 19-nation single currency area improve. The central bank has set interest rates at record lows and buys tens of billions of euros of bonds per month in a bid to drive up growth and inflation. At the meeting of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there was a general recognition that the balance of risk has improved, certainly as far as growth is concerned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ECB president Mario Draghi told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no longer that sense of urgency in taking further actions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is a gradual process,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he went on at a Frankfurt press conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The governing council members want to be convinced they see a self-sustained adjustment in the inflation rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before closing the money sluices, he said. For now, faced with uncertain impacts from global upheavals abroad and elections at home, the ECB plans to continue its bond-buying scheme until December as planned, as well as maintaining its commitment to interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at present or lower levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the foreseeable future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spring is coming and the ECB is celebrating,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd judged analyst Florian Hense of Berenberg bank, while noting that, despite the lifting spirits, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it has not moved significantly closer to actually tightening policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Goodnight. GW Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Mario Draghi has proved he was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153king of curveballs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in Frankfurt. After delivering what was arguably a dovish statement early on in his press conference, and clearly stating that for the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP and inflation forecasts are conditional on the implementation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153of all our policy measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi displayed a more hawkish tone during the Q&amp;A. The key takeaway from this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting appears contradictory: QE is here to stay in the Eurozone, until at least the end of this year. However, more policy action is less likely because deflation risks have receded. Reading between the lines suggests that the next change from the ECB will be towards removing accommodation and not adding it. Aberdeen Asset Management investment manager Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Donnell says Draghi has given a small hint that the ECB could adjust its policy stance soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi has ever so slightly opened the door to changing their policy stance. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done this by saying that the Governing Council talked about changing the language about where rates are in their monthly statement, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change it. This is effectively him signalling that something might change in the future, just not today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a classic Draghi technique of saying something that will move markets without actually doing anything. Due to this, and a wordy response to a question about raising rates before QE ends, markets will now start to recalibrate on the assumption that the ECB will remove accommodation towards the end of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jamie Dutta, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, says the ECB president \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flip-flopped\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between his bearish opening statement, and some bullish remarks in the press conference. The ECB and Mario Draghi celebrated its two year anniversary of its Asset Purchase Program by being marginally less dovish than expected in the monthly press conference. It was an interesting balancing act for Draghi between unchanged monetary policy stimulus policies and improved economic prospects. The market took the upgraded forecasts for growth and inflation in its stride. However they reacted more positively when Draghi stated that there was no longer a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsense of urgency on taking further actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to boost inflation and the recovery. Indeed Draghi further said the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisks to deflation have largely disappeared\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And Pictet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Frederik Ducrozet shows how the ECB has raised its forecasts for inflation in 2017 and 2018: The press conference ends with Mario Draghi insisting that the euro is irrevocable, and not going to break up. The ECB president declares that: The euro is here to stay. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about whether or not it is irrevocable. It is. The ECB president calls the euro a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153channel for solidarity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which might rankle with those suffering financial plight in Greece). Draghi points out that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania all joined the single currency since the financial crisis began, due to the benefits of membership. We need to make monetary union function better, Draghi adds, to increase prosperity in the region. And this bullish talk has helped to push the euro up. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 0.6% at $1.06. German bond prices are falling, driving up the yield on the debt. Traders are reacting to the news that the ECB has dropped its pledge to use \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall available instruments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to achieve its mandate, and is now less worried about deflation. Mario Draghi is treading an interesting path at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. On the one hand, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking up the prospects for the eurozone economy and saying there is no longer a deflation risk. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also warning that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdownside risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that could derail the recovery. Why? Because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a firm eye on upcoming elections, particularly in France. Q: Were today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions unanimous? Enigmatically, Draghi says the discussion was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconsensual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122..... Rather sweetly, Draghi suggests that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18 months since Britain voted to leave the EU. Just nine, old boy. Although it sometimes feels like nine years... Draghi says the governing council did not discuss ending its QE programme, or boosting it, at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Mario Draghi sounds somewhat concerned about geopolitics, warning that global risks have risen recently. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet seen negative consequences from the Brexit vote, he adds, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear how various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk events\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will play out. Draghi is asked about the criticism of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus from Peter Navarro, trade advisor to Donald Trump, who argues that the euro is unfairly weak. Draghi defends Berlin, saying he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any merit in attacking Germany. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is the euro, and eurozone monetary policy is set for the whole region, he insists. Q: Could the ECB raise interest rates before it has ended its QE programme? Draghi ducks the question. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting, as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously insisted that rate would not rise until the asset-purchase programme had concludes. On deflation....Mario Draghi says that the risks have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153largely disappeared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Market-based inflation expectations have increased noticeably. In a hawkish move, the European central bank has dropped an important line from its statement. The pledge to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the instruments at its disposal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if necessary to achieve it mandates has been removed. Mario Draghi says this has been dropped because the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sense of urgency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has gone, suggesting the ECB is less worried about the situation. Hello again. Sorry about that breakdown - while I was away, Mario Draghi has been speaking to the press in Frankfurt. The ECB president has announced slightly higher growth forecasts; GDP is now expected to rise by 1.8% in 2017 (up from 1.7% in December) and by 1.6% in 2018 (up from 1.5%) It has also raised its inflation forecast this year to 1.7% (from 1.3%). Draghi still sound cautious, saying: The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having a few technical issues here , so might miss the start of the ECB press conference #developing.... Markus Ferber, a German conservative MEP, is unhappy that the European Central Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise interest rates today. Ferber argues that the ECB should have responded to the recent rise in euro area inflation, to 2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The inflation rate is picking up and the European economy is growing strongly. Now would be the perfect time for Mario Draghi to show a little courage and end the period of zero interest rate. The craving for cheap money is like an addiction that has to stop now. This is even more so as monetary policy in the USA and the EU are at risk of drifting further and further apart. In the US, the main interest rate is already higher than in the Eurozone and the Federal Reserve plans to have two to three additional interest rate hikes this year alone. I am disappointed that the ECB missed yet another chance to initialise a normalisation of monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors need to watch the political landscape closely, to understand why the ECB didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change policy today. We have two major events coming up which can have some serious impact on the Euro; the elections in Netherland and elections over in France. If any of these anti- euro party wins the election, this would create a lot of trouble for the European central bank. Basically, when you have the concept of euro under threat, the last thing you want to do is to create more panic in the market. It is in Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest to keep buying more time until we have navigated through all these storms and sailing becomes smoother. While we wait for Draghi, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of a papier mache caricature of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker, from the Rose Monday carnival parade in Cologne last month. It must have been popular with German savers who dislike Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut interest rates to zero. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to the ECB announcement: The European Central Bank has also declared it will keep running its stimulus programme. And despite pressure from hawks to start tightening, the ECB insists it could boost its bond-buying firepower if needed. The ECB says: : Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that it will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 billion until the end of this month and that, from April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Here we go! The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and kept its pledge to cut them again in future if needed. That means that borrowing costs stay at their current record lows, despite inflation jumping to 2% this month. So: the main rate sticks at 0.0% The deposit facility rate stays at -0.4% (meaning commercial banks will be charged for leaving funds at the ECB). The marginal lending rate, charged when banks borrow from the ECB, stays at 0.25% There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no change to the commitment to keep borrowing costs low, either. The ECB says: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Capital Economics predict that Mario Draghi will resist pressure to start considering tightening monetary policy: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for the ECB to chew on -- more than three quarters of Greek families have difficulty, or great difficulty, making ends meet. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one factoid in a new UK report into national wellbeing, released this morning by the Office for National Statistics. It says: According to data from Eurostat, 16% of all households in the UK reported great difficulty or difficulty in making ends meet in 2015. This was lower than the estimated EU\u00e2\u20ac\u201c28 average of 26%, and was the same as Estonia (16%). The countries with the highest proportion of households reporting great difficulty or difficulty in making ends meet were Greece (78%) and Bulgaria (64%), while the lowest proportion of households were in Sweden (5%) and Finland (7%). The full report is online: Measuring national well-being in the UK: international comparisons, 2017 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the European Central Bank to end the suspense (!) and reveal the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting, at 12.45 GMT (1.45pm in Frankfurt) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting any changes to interest rates, but the ECB easily change the language in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. That could include dropping the suggestion that interest rates could be cut to new record lows, or that it stands ready to boost its bond-buying programme. Nick Kounis of ABN Amro explains: ECB expert Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank predicts that Mario Draghi will make some subtle changes to his statement at 1.30pm GMT (2.30pm Frankfurt time). Fred also expects the ECB to raise its forecasts for growth and inflation this year. Sir Martin Sorrell, the advertising magnate, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffering from the wage squeeze. WPP has reported that CEO Sorrell will receive more than \u00c2\u00a340m though its LEAP incentive plan, pushing his total package closer to \u00c2\u00a350m. This is the final instalment of LEAP, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a bad week for the markets. Shares, bonds and commodity prices have all weakened since Monday, the cost of insuring bonds has gone up, and most currencies have lost ground against the US dollar. In London the FTSE 100 index is now down 50 points, or 0.6%, at 7283, and on track for its sixth loss in a row. Oil companies have now joined the big fallers, with Shell down 3% following the drop in the crude price. Mining stocks are being hit hard too. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a generally nervous mood in the markets, as the rally that begin after the US election fades. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the mood: Signs of a broad-based risk off mentality are cropping up like spring daffodils at present. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge in oil prices took most of the attention, but the other major warning signal was the rout in junk bonds; like stocks these have gained significantly since the election, and like stocks they enjoyed more gains in February. The heavy selling in the high yield ETF over the past week sounds another alarm for equity bulls. To add to the signs of doom, mining shares in London are in full-blown retreat, as a stronger dollar and falling commodity prices take their toll The German banking industry has urged the European Central Bank to give a signal today that it could start unwinding its ultra-loose monetary policy stance soon. Reuters has the story: The BdB private banking association said the fact that the threat of deflation has disappeared in the euro zone and inflation was picking up justified its recommendation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such a step must be prepared very, very well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and policymakers should communicate it carefully, BdB head Michael Kemmer told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it would be important, I think, that the ECB today opens the door to the exit (of its expansive monetary policy),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kemmer said. How would that door open? One option is that the ECB could drop its pledge that interest rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period. Or, Mario Draghi could outline how it would slow (or taper) its QE programme. But as flagged earlier, many analysts think there are good reasons to leave the exit door locked. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Draghi doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a repeat of 2011 or 2008, when the ECB tightened too quickly. This fear is likely to drive policymakers to remain dovish and keep the taps open. The risks remain to the downside - even with what markets consider \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo much\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 QE. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh class problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talked about by Draghi is that the European economy is doing better and the talk is now of tightening. The longer the ECB is minded to refrain from changing policy, the more markets will expect a rate rise or tapering to come. Indeed markets are doing a lot of the tightening work for the ECB as the front end of the yield curve is rising. Newsflash: The price of US crude oil has suddenly taken a tumble, dropping below $50 per barrel for the first time since December 2016. Traders are blaming figures, released yesterday, which showed a surge in US crude oil stocks. That caused a 5% drop in the oil price yesterday, and it looks like people are still worried... Brent crude has also fallen, by over 5% to around $52.11 per barrel. Speaking of weak pay.... John Lewis staff have just learned that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting their smallest bonus since the 1950s. Employees will receive an extra three week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay, or 6% of basic salary, under its profit-sharing scheme (John Lewis is owner by its workers, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpartners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). Better than a poke with a sharp stick, of course...but it must still be a disappointment to staff at John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores, and at Waitrose. This is the fifth year running that the bonus has fallen - back in 2011, the bonus was a chunky 18%. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield says the retailer needs to retain cash for investment in an increasingly uncertain market. British workers are suffering the worst decade for pay growth since Arthur Wellesley was giving Napoleon Bonaparte a bloody nose at Waterloo. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the verdict of the Resolution Foundation, which has crunched the numbers in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Director Torsten Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big picture from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget is that the big squeezes on both the public and family finances have been prolonged well into the 2020s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the Office for Budget Responsibility at least delivered some good news on borrowing, the family finances picture has actually deteriorated since the autumn statement. Britain is set for a return to falling real pay later this year, with this decade now set to be the worst for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also calculated that, on current form, Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eliminate its deficit until 2025 - 15 years after George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first austerity budget. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting is also overshadowed by presidential elections in France and the Netherlands. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason for the ECB to sit tight today, argues Carsten Brzeski of ING: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With headline inflation in the euro zone back at the magic 2 percent, the ECB hawks and critics will gradually sense that their moment has come to push for tapering. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our view, however, they will not want to add any new uncertainty in the eve of two important elections in the Eurozone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several experts are arguing that the European Central Bank should ignore calls to start winding back its stimulus programme. Guntram Wolff of the Bruegel thinktank says underlying inflationary pressures are still too weak: Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts that the ECB won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start to dial back its bond-buying programme until the autumn. We seem to have entered a post-inflation era for central bankers, who used to try and prevent price pressures from building. Now we tend to see a willingness for central banks, including the Bank of England, the ECB and, to a smaller extent, the Federal Reserve, to look through periods of high inflation in order to protect growth. Thus, the fact that headline CPI reached 2% is unlikely to deter the ECB from keeping rates in negative territory and maintaining asset purchases, potentially into 2018. We do expect the ECB to revise up its long-term inflation forecast at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, which could trigger some euro buying as the market anticipates a premature end to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme. We also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the ECB to announce any plans to taper its asset purchases any time soon. Firstly, growth in the region remains uneven, for example, the Greek economy contracted sharply at the end of 2016, Finnish growth was flat and Italy could only muster growth of 1%. These are economies that need support from their central bank, and even the German finance minister in a recent speech noted that the ECB was doing a good job to balance policy for all Eurozone members. We think that the ECB is approx. 6-months away from announcing a taper to its QE programme. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstraight bat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from president Draghi: No policy change is expected....Mario Draghi will acknowledge the better economic backdrop and higher inflation, but avoid any watering-down of the dovish bias. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two years since the European Central Bank took the plunge and started stimulating the eurozone economy with newly created money. And just look how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grown.... European stock markets have opened in the red, as investors await news from the ECB at lunchtime. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is the biggest faller, shedding 44 points or 0.6% to 7289 points. Morrisons is the biggest faller, down 5.5%. It warned this morning that there are uncertainties ahead, including the impact of the weak pound driving up imported food prices. Mining shares are down too. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council may have a spring in its step today, as policymakers gather for their latest policy meeting in Frankfurt. After years of low inflation, the consumer prices index is finally back on target at 2% - meaning that fears of a deflationary spiral can be put to bed. But the ECB still has a problem; what to do about its massive stimulus programme that is pumping billions of euros into the eurozone each month? Hawkish members of the ECB will be putting pressure on president Mario Draghi to start the process of winding back its bond-buying QE programme. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also like Draghi to signal that the interest rates could rise, having been slashed to record lows of zero (or lower, for banks who leave money in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the timings: 12.45pm GMT: ECB announce its decision on interest rates and QE 1.30pm GMT: Mario Draghi press conference The markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting any new measures today; but the key, as so often with Draghi, is the language he uses. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: The market will be watching for any changes to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language today, particularly whether it may drop its current bias toward lower interest rates which would likely be interpreted as a potential signal that the period of ultra-accommodative monetary policy is coming to an end, even if the ECB is still someway from signalling a readiness to raise rates. Our view is that the Governing Council will keep its forward guidance language as is for the time being pointing to the continued weakness of core inflation as justification. The ECB will also issue new staff forecasts on growth and inflation; these are likely to be revised higher. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be a lively day in the currency markets: Also coming up today.... UK chancellor Philip Hammond will be busy defending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, and the proposed rise in national insurance contributions for the self-employed. Tory MPs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy about this apparent breach of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto commitments, so it could be a long day for Hammond.... Supermarket chain Wm Morrison, the Co-operative Bank, Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza and estate agent Countrywide are reporting results. The John Lewis chain will be telling its staff the size of their annual bonus. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be much smaller than in recent years, which explains why journalists aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invited to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. Finance journalist Simon Neville (and his young apprentice) are disappointed... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

This means some leaders can refuse to discuss future trade links, for example, until other contentious issues have been nailed down - such as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outstanding financial promises to the bloc.</p> <p>As McCormack puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lack of full control over the negotiating agenda is the most important of these. While Prime Minister May has said a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU is one of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objectives, some European leaders have suggested that post-exit trade arrangements can only be considered after the terms of exit have been agreed. </p> <p>A related challenge will be settling the financial terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, which is likely to be among the issues EU leaders seek to resolve up front. The UK will have a strong incentive to settle its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exit bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quickly to preserve as much of the two-year negotiating period as possible for more difficult and important issues.

As one UK official closely involved in the process puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some days I wake up and think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all going to be fine. Other days, it feels like a disaster in the making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>I feel the same way. It seems to me likely that Brexit will work out badly for Britain and fairly badly for the EU. But there are so many different variables involved that nobody sensible can be sure. There are three main \u00e2\u20ac\u0153known unknowns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. First, the negotiations themselves. Second, events in the wider world. Third, the unpredictable economic effects of what ever deal is struck.</p> <p> When it comes to the negotiations, both sides are talking tough. The EU is likely to demand a costly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153divorce settlement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to settle Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpaid bills and may refuse to discuss a trade deal until the UK has agreed to pay up.</p> <p>The early British response has been uncompromising. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has evoked the ghost of Margaret Thatcher. He and the Daily Mail will surely soon follow up with references to Winston Churchill. There is a high chance that the money issue will cause negotiations to break down before they really get going.</p> <p>However, it is also clearly possible that both sides are bluffing, and will back off. The more realistic voices in the UK government understand the dangers of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in which the parties fail to agree a deal.

                "bodyText":"Finally, George Mudie MP asks if the possibility of Scotland breaking away from the UK will be modelled in the next OBR forecasts Robert Chote replies that the OBR bases its work on UK government policy, so it all depends on the situation in November. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the session, and this blog. See you tomorrow.. GW The Treasury Committee have also been considering the issue of Charlotte Hogg, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England who broke its code of conduct by not reporting that her brother works for Barclays bank. The Committee is due to issue a report on her appointment, and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look terribly good for Hogg. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest: Q: What impact has the gig economy had on the UK labour market, and on weak wage growth? Chote says the OBR has made an assumption that self-employment numbers will grow faster than the rest of the labour market (previously it assumed they rose in parallel). And in the past, increases in self-employment has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more disadvantageous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than the OBR expected, because many of those jobs were low paid. Wes Streeting, another Labour MP, asks the OBR about its persistent habit of over-estimating wage growth. Q: What are you going to do about it? Robert Chote defends the watchdog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record, pointing out that while wage growth has been weaker than forecast, employment growth has been stronger. So the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad assessment of the economy may be right, but the gains are going into new jobs, not higher pay. John Mann MP asks the OBR about Brexit Q: What is your projection for a reduction on EU nationals in the years after Brexit? Robert Chote says the OBR doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make its own forecasts, but it uses projections drawn up by the Office for National Statistics. Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie asks about the data which the Treasury supplies to the OBR to help it draw up its forecasts. Q: Why can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the figures be released publicly? Is there any confidential data about individual taxpayers in there? The OBR say they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any individual taxpaper information, so that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. But there might be a risk of giving information about tax loopholes. Robert Chote looks wary of exposing the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers to public gaze -- if this happened, ministers might get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot less candid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about what they told the OBR. Really, asks Tyrie. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out doing anything just because someone might throw a tantrum, he insists. Back at parliament, Jacob Rees-Mogg MP asks the OBR about the UK tax take. This is heading towards the highest levels since Harold Wilson was prime minister at the end of the 1960s (at around 38% of national income, I think). Q: Is it as high as it can get? Robert Chote points out that many countries have a rather higher tax take, while others have much lower levels. Q: But aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we close to the highest levels appropriate for the UK? Sir Charlie Bean replies that he suspects we are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some way from the Laffer Curve tipping point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (where a rise in tax rate brings in less money). However, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we may be at the political equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Bean adds, where politicians won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be willing to propose higher tax rates. Investors won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about article 50 being triggered tomorrow, it seems. Westminster correspondents are reporting that Theresa May won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fire the Brexit starting gun until the end of this month. Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for a new independence referendum may have forced the PM into a delay. Our political editor Heather Stewart reports: The government insists this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a u-turn, but Sam Coates of The Times says many won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree: Back in parliament, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is fielding questions on the budget. Q: Did the OBR come under any undue pressure when drawing up its economic and fiscal outlook, and its assessment of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget? OBR chief Robert Chote says it did not come under pressure from ministers, and all its requests for information from government departments were met. In the past, we have received \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunsolicited submissions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Chote smiles - which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like pressure compared to some of the actual pressure he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s felt at times. Q: Now we are moving to one fiscal event a year, rather than two, do we need two statements from the OBR each year? Sir Charlie Bean, who joined the OBR recently, says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfectly reasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to think that the second set of economic forecasts should be dropped. That would also limit the temptation for ministers to put pressure on the watchdog. Q: The chancellor announced a new transitional relief fund to help companies facing higher business rates. How many firms will it actually help? Chote says the funds will be handled by local authorities, who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much instruction on how to use it. They could provide significant help to the worst cases, or spread the support across more companies. We just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do yet. That transitional relief will also \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over the next few years, while business rates are set to rise steadily. The FTSE 100 index has also closed higher, up 0.3% at 7367. Mining stocks rallied, following a pick-up in commodity prices. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies has closed at a new record high. The FTSE 250 finished at 19,029 points, showing that Brexit angst isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hitting the markets yet. The rally was driven by engineering firm Amex Foster, which closed 11% high after agreeing a takeover bid from John Wood. Housebuilder Bovis, which is being courted by Redrow and Galliford Try, jumped by 9,9%. Over at parliament, the Treasury committee are questioning the Office for Budget Responsibility over last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. Robert Chote, head of the independent watchdog is there, along with Sir Charlie Bean and Graham Parker. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye out for any early fireworks... (we did hear a lot from the OBR last week). Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that sterling could get spooked if Scotland does press on with a second referendum (one of Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five challenges today). He also believes the independence campaign will need to reassure voters about the economic case for breaking away from the UK, and some more detailed answers (ie, which currency they might use). Turner writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Brexit has, of course, added a new dimension, the economic concerns that led the majority in Scotland to vote to remain a part of the UK have not disappeared. Scottish GDP lags behind the UK and declining oil revenues have raised questions over the fiscal sustainability for an independent Scotland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if it intends to retain the pound. While EU membership may provide Scotland with a preferable trade agreement, carving a new membership would be no mean feat and the UK still remains Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trading partner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market reaction to Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has been muted so far, most likely because she still has a long way to go to achieve approval for a second Referendum and the announcement was well-flagged. Yet if approval becomes increasingly likely, we expect volatility in sterling to rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for a fresh referendum on independence isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurting the pound. Sterling is holding onto this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, and changing hands at $1.223 against the US dollar, up 0.5% today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes traders believe Scotland would vote to remain in the UK (assuming this second referendum actually happens). She says; A second referendum for Scotland is not a key event risk for UK asset markets right now for a couple of reasons: firstly, Nicola Sturgeon didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give an actual date for this referendum, it could happen sometime between 2018 and 2019, which is probably too far in the future for the markets to start worrying and pricing in the break up of the United Kingdom. Also, the latest opinion polls suggest that a second referendum would go the same way as the first, and the majority of voters would choose to stay in the United Kingdom. While opinion polls still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fully trusted, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough, at this stage, to keep UK markets calm. Another reason for calm is that the UK government (which must approve the plan) has tried to slap down the idea, saying another referendum would be divisive (!) and cause economic uncertainty (!!). Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has tweeted her opposition too. European Central Bank Mario Draghi has warned that productivity in the eurozone is being held back because too few firms are embracing new technology. Opening a conference on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fostering Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Euro area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi argues that the future was brighter than coms fear. He says: If, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economic area, we were to dismantle barriers to innovative activity in the euro area, it would clearly give a boost to global innovation. Europe, though, has been slower than America when it comes to using new technologies such as computers, Draghi continues: This is a long-standing issue for the euro area: better adoption of ICT in the United States appears to explain most of the productivity gap between the US and the EU15 from 1995 to 2007. And small firms, Draghi concludes, need to catch up! There are many reasons why it is a priority today in the euro area to address weak productivity growth. But while some progress can be made in innovation, it is not in my view the sole issue. Equally important for the euro area is to facilitate and encourage the spread of new technology from the frontier to the laggard firms. Simply by diffusing better the technology we already have in the euro area, we could make sizeable gains in productivity. In other words, there is much we can still do to reverse the aggregate productivity slowdown and dispel pessimism about our future. Wall Street has just opened for the week, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much excitement. The Dow Jones index and the S&amp;P 500 have both dipped by a mere 0.01%. Maybe traders are feeling lethargic after losing an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep on Sunday as America moved to Daylight Saving Time (Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the leap until 26 March). Is some UK economic data being leaked before publication, and are some unscrupulous investors profiting? New research published in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests that some people in the markets may be making a killing by trading on official reports from the Office for National Statistics before they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re published. The WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Bird writes: UK. government-bond futures often move sharply in the 24 hours before sensitive economic reports are released, an analysis of trading data shows, a phenomenon that suggests some investors may be trading with knowledge of official statistics before they are made public. On average, between April 2011 and December 2016, U.K. government-bond futures correctly anticipated the rise or fall that ultimately happened when economic data were published, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University. More here: Market Drift Suggests Some Investors May Be Trading on U.K. Economic Data Ahead of Release ONS reports are typically distributed among more than 100 people in government circles in the run-up to the official publication. And I can remember a few occasions over the years when gilts, or the pound, suddenly rose or fell just before 9.30am (when many ONS reports hit the wires). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not proof of a leak, of course. But any hint of wrong-doing is a serious concern. Sam Bowman, Executive Director of the Adam Smith Institute, wants action: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reports that markets are moving ahead of official ONS data releases in a way that is consistent with leaks and insider trading must be taken extremely seriously by the government and the ONS. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If flaws in ONS procedures are enabling market-moving leaks to take place, allowing some individuals to profit off secret information, then something has gone badly wrong. The Cabinet Office should review ONS procedures and consider substantial reforms in light of this new evidence. Bowman argues that Britain could learn from America: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We could follow the lead of the United States, where these suspicious market movements are seldom seen, and data is released less than 24 hours after completion and statistical reports are physically delivered to the President. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An alternative option would be to make the process entirely open, so that the public (and the markets) can see ONS data in real-time as it is generated, and markets can price in new information immediately and openly. The ONS is already working on this, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings should be an urgent call to action for them to speed up the process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Up in Edinburgh, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask the Scottish parliament to vote next on week on whether to hold a second independence vote. Sturgeon is arguing that Scotland shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken down the path of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 without being offered the alternative of an independent future inside the EU. It adds yet another dimension to the Brexit story...but the pound is curiously unmoved by this added political uncertainty. Rating agency Fitch has fired a sobering blast at anyone who thinks Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU will be simple. In a new commentary, James McCormack, Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Head of Sovereign Ratings, outlines five challenges facing Theresa May as she prepared to trigger article 50. McCormack points out that May doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the luxury of controlling the agenda of the Brexit talks. This means some leaders can refuse to discuss future trade links, for example, until other contentious issues have been nailed down - such as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outstanding financial promises to the bloc. As McCormack puts it: Lack of full control over the negotiating agenda is the most important of these. While Prime Minister May has said a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU is one of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objectives, some European leaders have suggested that post-exit trade arrangements can only be considered after the terms of exit have been agreed. A related challenge will be settling the financial terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, which is likely to be among the issues EU leaders seek to resolve up front. The UK will have a strong incentive to settle its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exit bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quickly to preserve as much of the two-year negotiating period as possible for more difficult and important issues. But in so doing, it risks criticism at home of an early and unnecessary concession McCormack also spies three domestic challenges on the horizon, including the prospect of the United Kingdom breaking up. Scotland may seek a bespoke solution to allow continued access to the single market, raising the risk of a second independence referendum if its objectives are unmet. Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First Minister is giving a speech on Brexit and Article 50 right now! Our Politics Liveblog is on the case: And that still leaves the possibility that some Brexit supporters get cold feet, if negotiations with the EU go badly. Beyond Scotland, there is certain to be plenty of open opposition to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating strategies and priorities, exposing possible political pressure points that can be exploited by EU negotiators. Finally, it will prove challenging for the government to manage expectations over a two-year period, and negotiating setbacks may be reflected in heightened financial market volatility. The biggest associated risk is a decided swing in public opinion toward a more negative view of Brexit, lending support for either a greater Parliamentary role in approving the final negotiated agreement or another opportunity for the electorate to formally express its view. Plenty for investors to fret about, then. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gideon Rachman has written a good piece today about the uncertainty that shrouds Brexit - and worries the markets. He writes: Brexit is still shrouded by uncertainty. As one UK official closely involved in the process puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some days I wake up and think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all going to be fine. Other days, it feels like a disaster in the making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I feel the same way. It seems to me likely that Brexit will work out badly for Britain and fairly badly for the EU. But there are so many different variables involved that nobody sensible can be sure. There are three main \u00e2\u20ac\u0153known unknowns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. First, the negotiations themselves. Second, events in the wider world. Third, the unpredictable economic effects of what ever deal is struck. When it comes to the negotiations, both sides are talking tough. The EU is likely to demand a costly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153divorce settlement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to settle Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpaid bills and may refuse to discuss a trade deal until the UK has agreed to pay up. The early British response has been uncompromising. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has evoked the ghost of Margaret Thatcher. He and the Daily Mail will surely soon follow up with references to Winston Churchill. There is a high chance that the money issue will cause negotiations to break down before they really get going. However, it is also clearly possible that both sides are bluffing, and will back off. The more realistic voices in the UK government understand the dangers of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in which the parties fail to agree a deal. And there are costs for the EU too. Britain is Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest export market...... More here: Anyone caught up in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rail strikes may be due compensation. So this chart from Money.co.uk could be useful: More info here: Southern Rail: Delay Repay compensation Northern Railways: Delay Repay Application Merseyrail: Refunds and Compensation Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk urges passengers to seek compensation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculous that travelling by train is becoming such a headache. The only consolation is you can claim a full refund if your train is cancelled and compensation if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delayed. Most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know they can get money back from the train company if their travel plans are ruined by strike action. You can fill in a claims form online, it takes 5 minutes and gives you something to do if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re left standing at the station so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely worth doing. Transport workers in Britain and Germany have downed tools this morning, leaving some passengers marooned and others struggling to get to work. In the UK, the Merseyrail and Northern rail networks have been hit by strike action that affects Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle. Unions are protesting against plans to introduce new trains with doors that can be operated by the driver, rather than guards. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of (yet another) strike affecting Southern rail, as the ongoing row between unions and management continues. While in Germany, hundreds of flights have been cancelled as airport ground crews hold a 25-hour stoppage. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling for a pay increase and better working hours, to reflect an increase in their workloads. Anxiety over Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely US interest rate rise is weighing on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets this morning. The UK, French and German trading floors are all rather subdued, meaning the main indices are little changed from Friday. With a rate hike priced in, investors will be happier when the Federal Reserve meeting is done and dusted. Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG says: Anyone wondering why the market is so quiet this morning will have to look no further than the Fed meeting for a reason. Another rate hike could be just days away, indeed, given the way the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers have been talking, it is practically a certainty at this point. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report reinforced the narrative, but the key now will be what the statement and press conference say. As a result we are likely to see the bullish flows that have dominated since the US election pause for breath, at least until Wednesday is out of the way. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets flags up that the drop in the dollar is pushing up commodity prices, and thus shares in miners. The oil price has hit a three-month low this morning. Brent crude slid to $51.26 per barrel, the weakest level since last November. And \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimplied volatility ha surged, suggesting traders expect the price to move dramatically in the coming weeks. The selloff is being driven by signs that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry is boosting production. Figures released on Friday showed a rise in the number of oil rigs in action, and earlier data showed inventories are building. This could all undermine the deal hammered out by Opec members last autumn to cut supplies. Currency experts predict that the pound will face further pressure once Theresa May launches Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union. Bloomberg has a good take. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We reject the notion that sterling has fully priced Article 50 and beyond. Risks to the currency remain to the downside on a disruptive start to negotiations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists including Kamal Sharma said in a note to clients on March 2, adding they see a dip before a recovery into the end of the year. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is also bearish. It recommended on March 3 selling the pound against the dollar at 1.2250, with a stop at 1.2530, as it sees the currency as the most over-valued in the Group-of-10 and investor confidence as vulnerable. Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred strategy is to bet on greater swings in the pound, rather than its direction. It has recommended buying three-month forward volatility, a measure of expected swings, with a target for it to gain around 20 percent from current levels. Societe Generale SA also sees opportunity in options, as it expects two-month implied volatility to pick up if cable falls below $1.20.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index has hit a fresh all-time high this morning, driven by merger activity. The FTSE 250, which is made up of medium-sized companies, hit 19,048 points in early trading. The rally is being led by engineering firm Amec Foster, which has surged by 19% after agreeing a takeover offer from larger rival John Wood (which is up 7.5%). Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains are also helping. The FTSE 250 has gained over 25% since the immediate aftermath of last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, defying speculation that the Brexit vote would cause financial trauma and a recession. In the City....shares in housebuilder Bovis Homes have surged by 8% in early trading, following takeover approaches from Redrow and Galliford Try. Although Bovis has rejected both offers, investors clearly suspect that a deal will be done - especially as Bovis is reeling from complaints of shoddy workmanship from hundreds of customers. Bovis shares are trading around 890p - and Neil Wilson of ETX Capital suggests a winning bid might be rather higher. Redrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer is valued at \u00c2\u00a38.14 per Bovis share, while Galliford Try\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is worth 886p per share. There is a strong chance that one will succeed and that should support the stock. But Bovis should hold out for a better premium. Joint brokers Deutsche Bank and Jeffries have price targets of 969p and 886p respectively. A successful bid might need to at least split the difference to satisfy the board. Although even that might not be enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only in January Deutsche Bank was targeting 1066p for Bovis. Above \u00c2\u00a310 a share might be more appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Westminster, the chatter is that Theresa May could trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Tuesday. The prime minister is due to update MP on events at last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU council meeting tomorrow, and could take the opportunity to get the Brexit ball rolling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite as simple as that. First, MPs would have to remove amendments inserted into the Brexit legislation by the House of Lords last week, which give parliament the right to veto May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eventual deal. Parliament is also digesting a warning that Britain would find itself in a dire position if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a trade deal with Europe. Labour MP Pat McFadden has accused some government ministers of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous complacency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, over their claims that Britain would be fine without a deal. My colleague Peter Walker explains: Open Britain, which groups a series of formerly pro-remain MPs from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, said leaving with no deal would mean the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choosing the most extreme position of all major trading nations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The research, by the House of Commons library, found that the EU does not currently trade with any G20 member without some sort of preferential trade arrangement in place. While many of these fell short of full FTAs, some G20 countries, notably Australia and Japan, were now seeking more comprehensive deals, Open Britain said... More here: After strong US jobs data last Friday, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong feeling in the markets that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday. That should encourage investors to hold the US dollar, as they can anticipate receiving a higher rate of return. But...the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually down this morning, shedding half a cent against the pound and the euro. So the pound is trading at $1.222, while the euro hit a one-month high of $1.0699. Why? FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy the rumor, sell the news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Investors are almost convinced that the Fed will move forward in tightening monetary policy, with speculators pricing in 89% chance of a rate hike according to CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FedWatch Tool. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust non-farm payrolls report removed all doubts and now even skeptical investors believe that three rate hikes are the base scenario for 2017. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a busy week for the markets. The US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates on Wednesday, accelerating the process of normalising monetary policy nearly a decade after the financial crisis began. Britain is poised to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the European Union. This could spark volatility in the foreign exchange world, with worries that the UK could crash out of the EU in 2019 without a trade deal. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: In the UK, going into the week that should see that Brexit-article 50 bill going finally through parliament, the press is full with reports about the government preparing for a scenario where no trade deal is struck with the EU in 2 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. Government officials, including various ministers, stress, however, that they expect a deal to be signed in due time. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of geopolitics to worry about too. German chancellor Angela Merkel meets US president Donald Trump on Tuesday; will Trump raise concerns over the German trade surplus? Finance ministers from the G20 group of leading economies are due to meet on Friday and Saturday. Plus, European elections are dominating attention too, as investors fret about the chances of another populist revolt. The Dutch go to the polls this week, and there is talk that the Green party could do well. Far-right leader Geert Wilders appears to be losing support, though.... Plus, the Bank of England will set UK interest rates and consider adjusting its stimulus programme on Thursday. Also coming up today Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda is a little light, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of items to watch: 1.30pm: ECB president Mario Draghi gives opening address on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, at a conference in Frankfurt 4.15pm: Robert Chote, head of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office for Budget Responsibility, testifies to the Treasury committee. British housebuilder Bovis homes finds itself at the heart of a takeover battle, after rivals Redrow and Galliford Try both propose mergers.",

The UK government stated ahead of the September 2014 referendum that it would in all circumstances honour its issued stock of UK debt if Scotland voted for independence.

While the OPEC acknowledged that compliance with the supply adjustments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers supported prices and it raised its global oil demand forecast for 2017, it also raised its estimates for oil production from outside of the cartel.

                "bodyText":"Worries about Brexit, as well as a second Scottish referendum, sent the pound to an eight week low of $1.2106 against the dollar. The US currency was also boosted by the prospect of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. But sterling has since recovered from its lows, although it is still down 0.47% at $1.2160. Against the euro, the pound has fallen 0.29% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1435 having earlier been as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1382. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Despite the fact that the pound is hugely undervalued by historical standards, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK means we find little to be bullish about for the pound as we face confrontational negotiations. One could be excused for feeling we have had quite enough referendums over the past year, yet with Scotland seeking a second vote, there are plenty of reasons to question what the UK will look like in just over two years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. On that note, it is time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A fall in the oil price, uncertainty over Brexit and a second Scottish referendum along with some caution ahead of an expected US interest rate rise on Wednesday and the Dutch election left equity markets in Europe lower on the day. Commodity companies came under pressure on the back of the drop in crude prices, while banks were also unwanted. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were particularly weak on the renewed concerns about Scottish independence. The French market dropped back on the latest twist in the presidential campaign while Italy and Spain also struggled. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.13% or 9.23 points at 7357.85 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.01% to 11,988.79 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.51% lower at 4974.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.86% to 19,537.40 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.91% at 9905.1 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.89% to 638.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 41 points or 0.2%. A second Scottish referendum which lead to a vote for independence would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a negative credit shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK economy and public finances, and could lead to a rating downgrade, according to a new report by Fitch. The agency, which has a AA rating with a negative outlook on the UK, said: We believe Scottish independence would have adverse effects on the UK public finances and economy and so would be credit negative for the UK, as we have previously stated. Key uncertainties include the impact on the future trade relationship between the two countries, the financial sector and Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency arrangements. Scottish independence would lead to an increase in the ratio of UK government debt to GDP. The UK government stated ahead of the September 2014 referendum that it would in all circumstances honour its issued stock of UK debt if Scotland voted for independence. This would lead to a one-off increase of around 8% of GDP in the UK gross public debt ratio as Scotland dropped out of UK GDP, on the basis of latest estimates of UK and Scottish GDP. At the same time, we would assume that Scotland would be responsible for a proportionate share of existing public debt in the form of a long-term bilateral loan, giving the UK an off-setting claim on Scotland. This UK asset would be taken into account in our judgement of the overall position and sustainability of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. We recognise that a wide range of outcomes from Brexit is possible and we will continue to assess the UK sovereign rating as developments unfold. The Negative Outlook on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign rating reflects the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote and the long-term challenge for the UK to reduce public debt. Ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Baden-Baden, the International Monetary Fund has called on the major economies to preserve the benefits of trade and avoid protectionism. With US president Trump showing protectionist tendencies and a propensity to rip up trade agreements, the IMF called for countries with trade and current account surpluses to work with countries with deficits to reduce these imbalances. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the global economy was improving but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it would be a mistake to assume that it will automatically return to rude health.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added: In fact, there has rarely been a period when policy choices have mattered more for what comes next, especially since there are still considerable risks to the outlook... Above all, we should collectively avoid self-inflicted injuries. This requires steering clear of policies that would seriously undermine trade, migration, capital flows, and the sharing of technologies across borders. Such measures would hurt the productivity, incomes, and living standards of all citizens. European markets have edged back from their lows and are now virtually unchanged, with the exception of France. The FTSE 100 is down just 0.08%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.02%. But France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.49% as the rightwing French presidential candidate Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Fillon was been placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds. See our full report here: Worries about a new Scottish referendum appear to be at least part of the reason for a slump in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. RBS, down around 3% at the moment, and Lloyds, nearly 2% lower, both said they would relocate to England if the Scots voted for independence at the last referendum in 2014. Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood told Reuters: [They] both have sizeable Scottish operations, so it depends what...ultimately happens there and whether [Scotland] actually exits the UK and stays part of Europe. Back with oil, and the price is continuing to slide. Brent crude is now down 1.7% at $50.47 while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2% to $47.40 after Saudi Arabia pumped more oil than expected in February. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: After a significant drop last week, oil prices tried to stabilise themselves at the start of this week as both contracts ended Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session slightly higher. Among other things, short-covering was the reason behind the slightly firmer oil prices then. Brent and WTI started Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session on the front foot. However, they turned lower again by mid-morning before going into a mini free fall by midday. The latest drop was apparently in response to the OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly oil report. While the OPEC acknowledged that compliance with the supply adjustments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers supported prices and it raised its global oil demand forecast for 2017, it also raised its estimates for oil production from outside of the cartel. In the US, shale producers have ramped up drilling activity and increased oil output in response to higher prices. This has put serious question marks over the OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to balance the oil market. The bad weather in New York seems unlikely to hold back the Federal Reserve from raising US interest rates at the end of its two day meeting. Defying the elements, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest gathering has apparently begun: And most analysts do indeed now expect an increase in borrowing costs following the recent strong economic data. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost certain we will see an increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve tomorrow. The question now is not if they will increase, but by how much. The US economy added 235,000 jobs in February from non-farm payroll data, confirming a positive outlook for the US economy. Additionally, Wall Street is up 5% since the beginning of 2017 which is an impressive performance by any measure. There is much discussion about whether this uptrend can continue with the possibility of the highest interest rates since 2007...We have a generation of investors who have become accustomed to investments trends with the back drop of an extremely accommodative monetary policy from the FED. Going forward, with possible three rate increases for 2017 alone, I predict we will see trepidation for the equity markets in general. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, agreed a rate rise was pretty much set in stone: Markets have fully priced the outcome, Fed speakers have shouted it from the rooftops and the aforementioned job figures confirm the continuation of American economic vibrancy. Because this is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fed meeting, with press conference and updated projections, there will be plenty of opportunities for the Fed to signal if it still believes three total tightening efforts are still appropriate for 2017, with another three scheduled for 2018. There is a risk that they upgrade this plan given economic strength. But our suspicion is that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, as the market already has a lot to digest given the sudden uptick in the pace of tightening from once per year to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once per quarter. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth projections should inch a little higher, though the extreme uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal policy suggests that any such movement should be tentative. The US stock market has opened cautiously, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 index both dropping by around 0.2%. Energy stocks are down, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in the oil price. Financial stocks are also in the red, while consumer-focused shares are up. Traders face a struggle to get to their desks today, due to the snow that has hit New York, and beyond. Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts a quiet day on Wall Street.... US markets could well feel the effect of the blizzard that has descended on New York in the past few hours. We could be in for a volume-light session, compounding the probability of another snooze-fest for US markets ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed decision. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Charlotte Hogg did the right thing by resigning -- and believes the Bank of England has lessons to learn over the affair. Hogg has done the right thing in resigning quickly. Better that than a long, drawn-out process that would eventually have ended with the same result. She was damaged goods. This incident shows that the system of oversight by the Treasury committee has worked. The grilling of Anthony Habgood, chairman of the Bank of England court, was forensic and showed MPs at their best. As the report noted, Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure raises wider concerns. The fact that Habgood had no inkling of Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to disclose her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job suggests the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance is not all it should have been. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the whole affair is that Habgood seemed to assume that because Hogg was an all-round good egg from a distinguished family he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to ask too many questions. While the pound dips, the US dollar is strengthening as investors anticipate the first US interest rate rise of 2017 tomorrow afternoon. Even the snow hitting the east cost of America isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to prevent the US Federal Reserve hiking borrowing costs, in response to the latest solid economic data. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial resilience to Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that she will push for a second vote on Scottish independence dwindled in early morning trade today, with sterling slipping to 8-week lows against the US dollar near the $1.21 mark. News that any new referendum won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen until late next year at the earliest may have softened the initial impact, but the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming political challenges are still driving sentiment with reports suggesting Theresa May will trigger Article 50 in the final week of March after getting the green light to initiate formal Brexit proceedings from Parliament last night. Meanwhile, expectations that the Fed will lift US interest rates tomorrow and prime markets for more to follow later in the year are also lending support to the dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price has taken another slide today, after Saudi Arabia revealed that it boosted production levels last month. New figures supplied to the Opec cartel show that Saudi pumped more than 10 million barrels per day in February. That means it has reversed some of the curbs it promised last November, when Opec agreed a historic deal to cut production. The news has knocked 1% off the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil, which has dropped to $50.85 per barrel for the first time in four months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation: Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure is a big blow to efforts to get more women into top jobs at the Bank of England. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Ward points out that men have dominated the monetary policy committee since it was created almost 20 years ago: The previous deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, is moving to run the London School of Economics, while professor Kristen Forbes is leaving the MPC in June when her first term expires. Having helped to prompt the end of Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career at the Bank of England, Andrew Tyrie MP has now welcomed her resignation. In a statement, the chair of the Treasury committee says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a regrettable business with no winners. Ms Hogg has acted in the best interest of the institution for which she has been working. This is welcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also welcome that the Bank has responded immediately by announcing an internal review. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance is already in much better shape than it was a few years ago. It is something to which the Governor and Court has been committed for some time. But there is clearly more to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee will be examining the conclusions of this work in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As well as criticising Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competence, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the Treasury committee didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the rest of the BoE in any glory. This exchange with BoE court chairman Anthony Habgood, during last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, was particularly excruciating: The financial markets have known for nine months that Britain was going to trigger the process of leaving the EU. But it seems that Brexit may not be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. George Saravelos, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank, believes that sterling could fall much further, and close to parity with the US dollar: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the market is slowly starting to realise that Brexit is anything but priced in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How can you price in an event of incredible complexity that has never happened before? We remain very bearish on the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201d our forecast is for a move close to $1.05.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the FT... Speaking of Brexit, one of the major groups in the European Parliament has backed a petition calling for UK citizens to be allowed to retain their EU citizenship rights after the break-up. ALDE is the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, led by former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, and has warned that any Brexit deal could be voted down unless EU citizens in Britain get the right to remain. Back in the markets, the pound is still bobbing around an eight-week low as traders worry about Brexit, and a possible second vote on Scottish independence. Sterling is down almost one cent right now, at $1.2127. Against the euro, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost over half a eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.141. Theresa May is due to update parliament about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Council summit later today; a chance for MPs to express their views and concerns about Brexit. So far today, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has voiced his disappointment that article 50 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being triggered today, while the UK government has warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the EU. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic call for a new vote on Scottish independence is a serious complication to the Brexit story, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. The complex issue of Brexit has been further affected by the additional twist of the call for a second Scottish Independence Referendum. The previous Scottish Referendum was supposed to have settled the issue for a generation but the SNP now claims that Brexit decision has changed this, as 62% of Scots voted to remain in the EU. This complicates the task facing the UK government as they have won parliamentary authority to trigger Article 50, to initiate the process for pulling out of the EU. Further to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments, the pound has now slumped into a two month low, at $1.2125. The lower pound is proving to be good for UK exports but inflation which is already showing signs of a significant revival could be boosted further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On a lighter note, gin and bicycle helmets are being included in the basket of goods used to track UK inflation. Both items were dropped over a decade ago, but have been brought back to reflect changing consumer habits. The Office for National Statistics says that: Gin consumption [is] on the rise, partly thanks to the significant growth in the number of small gin producers. Bicycle helmets are also returning to the basket after a 12-year absence, following the significant increase in the popularity of cycling due to sporting successes by British cyclists in the Olympics and the Tour De France. The ONS has also added \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no dairy milk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items, such as soya, rice and oat milk; these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free From\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items have all risen in popularity in recent years. Basic mobile phone handsets have been dropped from the basket. In another tweak, the stats body has stopped tracking the price of child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swings, and replaced them with child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scooters. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another attempt to better measure what parents spend money on: The number of price quotes collected for the swing has been falling reflecting its availability in shops particularly in the winter months and the change is an attempt to improve coverage of outdoor play equipment particularly in those winter months.

Charlotte Hogg actually offered to resign last week, when she also admitted to MPs that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed to report her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role at Barclays. The Bank has just published Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation letter, in which she insists she made an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honest mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by not fully complying with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct (which she helped to draw up). She also reiterates that she never shared any information with her brother , but recognises that saying sorry isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the letter, dated yesterday (suggesting she resigned last night, after MPs met to discuss the issue before drawing up this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report). Labour MP Angela Eagle says Hogg has made the right decision: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, from the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor Kamal Ahmed: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our political editor Heather Stewart: NEWSFLASH: Charlotte Hogg has resigned from the Bank of England, following the scathing report from the Treasury committee. In a statement, the BoE says it accepted her resignation with deep regret. Anthony Habgood, Chair of Court, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In her time at the Bank, Charlotte Hogg has made a huge contribution in areas such as professionalising and modernising the management and operations of the Bank, leading the implementation of the strategic plan, championing diversity and driving forward the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of key issues such as Fintech and Operational Risk. No one who knows her doubts her track record or her integrity. While Charlotte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by any measure exceeds the standard that would be expected in the private sector or would be required under statute, it is understandable in the circumstances and she has taken it with the best interests of the Bank at heart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank, says he also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply regrets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd her decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I fully respect her decision taken in accordance with her view of what was the best for this institution, I deeply regret that Charlotte Hogg has chosen to resign from the Bank of England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since Charlotte joined the Bank almost four years ago, she has transformed its management and operations. Drawing on her extensive private sector experience and her unrelenting commitment to excellence, she has led a broad range of initiatives to build a more open and inclusive institution, to overhaul our IT systems, and to change fundamentally how the Bank develops, manages and rewards its dedicated public servants. Along the way, she has inspired countless colleagues at the Bank and attracted a new cohort of professionals to it. The combination of Charlotte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique skills and drive were exceptionally well suited to lead similar transformations of our markets and banking responsibilities, particularly given the growing importance of FinTech, operational excellence and the management of cyber risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlotte Hogg is under serious pressure now, following the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that she lacks the competence to be deputy governor. Wes Streeting, another member of the committee, says she should step down. Newsflash: The Treasury Committee has just declared that Charlotte Hogg, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, has fallen short of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighest standards\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 required for the role. In a new report, MPs have criticised Hogg for not reporting that her brother Quintin works for Barclays, when she joined the Bank in 2013 as chief operating officer. Hogg only revealed this breach of the code of conduct last week, having initially told the committee that she had reported all possible conflicts of interest. And the Treasury Committee has now concluded that this means Hogg is not up to the job of deputy governor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very serious rebuke. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key conclusion from its report: In its Report on 2 March, the Committee concluded that Ms Hogg had the professional competence necessary to fulfil the role of Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. Had it known then what has since been disclosed, it would have taken a different view. Professional competence for this role includes an ability to follow the rules, particularly those that one has had a hand in writing and enforcing; an understanding of why those rules are important; and an awareness of the risks arising from actual and potential conflicts of interest, and the perceptions of conflict. Ms Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oral and written evidence has given the Committee grounds for concern on all three counts. The Committee considers that her professional competence falls short of the very high standards required to fulfil the additional responsibilities of Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. John Mann MP, a member of the committee, says this is its strongest ever ruling. The British Chambers of Commerce has added to the jitters in the City this morning. Although the BCC has raised its growth forecast for 2017, it also cut its forecasts for 2018 and predicted that consumer spending will falter as inflation rises. More here: Foreign exchange traders are starting to get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spooked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the prospect of two years of Brexit negotiations, warns Kathleen Brooks of City Index. Parliament may have passed the Brexit Bill, but a source at the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said that Article 50 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be triggered today, instead we will have to wait until the end of March, when Dutch elections and the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 60th birthday celebrations are out of the way. The pound has taken a sharp drop in early Tuesday trading, in fairness liquidity has been thin, however, it suggests that the reality of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divorce from Europe and two years of horse-trading to agree trade deals is beginning to spook the FX market. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sterling has dropped like a rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this morning, as traders wake up to the reality that the UK will trigger article 50 this month. Theresa May is heading towards hard Brexit negotiations with an attitude that she has nothing to lose. The biggest fear on the street is what will her EU partners will say and how they are going to treat this matter given that Brexit is about to become a reality. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index, which contains many medium-sized UK companies, hit a fresh all-time high in early trading. A cheaper pound boosts the value of UK companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overseas earnings, and also makes them more vulnerable to takeover bids from foreign rivals. Financial experts believe that Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for a new referendum on independence is also hitting the pound today. Theresa May tried to slap down the idea yesterday, claiming the Scottish Government was playing politics by requesting a second vote. But the City is concerned that the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is also in doubt, as the PM starts the devilishly complicated task of exiting the EU. Investors must consider whether the vote will happen, whether it will be before or after Brexit, and what the result might be. Carsten Nickel of Teneo Intelligence says: The many questions surrounding the latest Scottish push for independence will further add to the already elevated levels of uncertainty. The coming days will likely see both pro- and anti-independence activists starting to work with strong assumptions about the consequences of a potential Scottish break-away, painting their positive or negative views as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inevitable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on calls for a second Scottish referendum is still evolving, but reports in the media overnight (The Times) suggest PM May is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preparing to reject\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the call. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that the prospect of a second Scottish independence vote is pushing sterling down this morning. The prospect of Britain triggering its exit from the European Union this month has hit sterling this morning. The pound has shed almost a cent against the US dollar in early trading, hitting $1.2125. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lowest point since mid-January, when Theresa May declared that Britain would leave the single market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 19% weaker than before last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. The pound is also down around 0.6% against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.140. Traders appear to be responding to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments in Westminster, where MPs gave their approval to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit bill. That gives the prime minister the power to formally trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and ends the tussle between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Lords had pushed, in vain, for the government to grant residency rights to EU nationals and guarantee MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader in the Lords, Lady Smith, told the Guardian that the Upper House realised there was no hope of changing MPs minds over this issue. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I thought there was a foot in the door or a glimmer of hope that we could change this bill, I would fight it tooth and nail, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case. Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be formally triggered today, but the government is adamant it will happen by the end of the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting today, where policymakers are widely expected to raise borrowing costs for the first time this year. The Federal Reserve meeting is taking place in a chilly New York, as a blizzard strikes the North East of America. That may prevent some Wall Street traders getting to work, but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent the Fed taking its decisions or holding a press conference tomorrow night. Investors will be keen to see how hawkish Fed chair Janet Yellen sounds, for clues on how many interest rates may come this year. In the UK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out which products have been added to the basket of goods used to calculate inflation, and which have been turfed out. The ONS will reveal all at 9.30am GMT. In Europe, the Dutch election race is reaching a climax. Voters head to the polls tomorrow, after watching prime minister Mark Rutte and far-right populist Geert Wilders clash in a TV debate last night. The escalating row between the Netherlands and Turkey, following a ban on Turkish ministers campaigning in the country, has added an extra level of tension and drama and put migration firmly in the spotlight (just where Wilders wants it). And in the City, online supermarket chain Ocado and copper producer Antofagasta are reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for us for tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the Federal Reserve rate rise: US Federal Reserve raises interest rates to 1% in bid to hold off inflation The US Federal Reserve has sought to head off rising inflation with a third interest rate rise since the 2008 financial crash and the second in three months, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. The central bank set aside concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on consumer spending to confirm analyst projections that it is prepared to increase rates several times this year to keep a lid on inflation as it rises above its 2% target level. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, Janet Yellen, said a wide range of indicators showed the US economy was in rude health, allowing its interest rate setting committee to push rates back towards historically normal levels. Policymakers voted nine to one to raise rates. Speaking after the decision, Yellen said she had met Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a couple of times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but had only been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153introduced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the president himself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I fully expect to have a strong relationship with secretary Mnuchin,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had good discussions about the economy, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC [Financial Stability Oversight Council] global economic developments, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she had had a very brief meeting with Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and appreciated that as well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Caution was the order of the day as the Fed took another step towards normalising monetary policy. So says our economics editor Larry Elliott, who writes: The key messages from Janet Yellen on Wednesday were that rates will continue to rise but at a cautious pace. She stressed that the central bank expected the economy to grow at a rate that would warrant gradual increases in interest rates. That will be taken as a hint that there will be two more rises during the course of 2017. The Fed has now raised interest rates three times in the past 15 months. Clearly, the period of ultra-low borrowing costs is at an end. The so-called normalisation of rates is under way. But it is also obvious that the Fed sees the new normal as being quite different to the old normal. In the mid-2000s, Alan Greenspan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed raised interest rates 17 times in gradual quarter-point jumps until they topped 5%. This time, the Fed sees rates peaking at a much lower level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as things stand they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there until 2019. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics says the Federal Reserve has achieved a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish tightening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of monetary policy with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise. Having test-driven a more hawkish communication strategy in the markets in the run-up to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unchanged gradualist stance and Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measured tone about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuit of a neutral policy stance have calmed investor nerves. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand is clearly guided by greater confidence in guiding the economy towards its dual inflation and full employment mandate, rather than a desire to start a bonfire in bond markets. The Fed has only made modest changes to its forecasts today, points out Chris Weston of IG: We have seen a slight upgrade to its view on business investment, which seems fair and while the Fed see inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moving\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to target they stipulated that the committee will carefully monitor actual inflation developments relative to its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symmetric inflation goal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One could argue this seems even a touch dovish, as it effectively signals that the Fed feel there are risks of inflation moving above its target of 2%. They are indirectly urging market participants to focus far more heavily on core inflation or PCE, given the volatility and unpredictability of energy and food prices. Capital Economics say: As everyone expected following the recent blitz by officials to prepare the markets, the Fed raised the fed funds target by another 25bp today, to between 0.75% and 1.00%, but officials left their interest rate projections largely unchanged. As a result, this hike won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prompt markets to revise up expectations of how fast monetary policy will be tightened over the next few years. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, is struck by the fact that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unanimous: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the Fed hiked interest rates, Kashkari voted against, showing not all FOMC members agree it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right time to normalise monetary policy. This contradicts the recent bullish market consensus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets are reassessing the future path of interest rate hikes, which is putting downward pressure on the dollar. The market had started to price in a total of four hikes this year, assuming the Fed was ready to begin an aggressive path of monetary tightening, but that is clearly no longer the case. Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, believes the Fed may miss its target of three hikes in 2017: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In all, the Fed looks unlikely to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake away the punchbowl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from global growth any time soon. Our base case is only one more hike this year. This is because we are likely reaching a cyclical peak soon, and the likelihood of a China slowdown weighing on global inflation, markets and growth is fairly high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US dollar has suffered its biggest one-day drop since January. That underlines that the Federal Reserve was less hawkish than some investors expected today. DING DING: The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, with the main indices all up after the Fed rate decision. Energy stocks led the rally, while financial stocks dipped a little Shares may be up today, but Goldman Sachs is worried that the rally may be over. Earlier today the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategists lowered their three-month outlook for global stocks to neutral, while staying overweight cash and underweight bonds. More here: Goldman Turns Cautious on Stocks as Fed Threatens to Upset Calm The US stock market is continuing to climb. The Dow is now up 127 points, or 0.6%, at 20,966, with less than 20 minutes until the closing bell. The US dollar continued to slide against other major currencies as Janet Yellen held her press conference. Traders are concluding that the Fed is still only planning to tighten monetary policy gradually - given policymakers expect two more hikes this year, and three in 2018. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about how the Fed is comfortable about allowing inflation to overshoot its target (see here) are also seen as dovish. The British pound has jumped by 1.25 cents to $1.228, a two week high. The dollar is also trading at a two-week low against the Japanese yen, down over 1% today. And the euro has hit a five week high, gaining around 1 cent to $1.07. Last question: Q: Some people think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to raise interest rates, because wage growth has been too low. I would like to see wages increase, and think there is scope for them to increase further, Yellen replies. But, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to achieve maximum employment and low, stable inflation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122why it hiked the Fed funds rate to 1% today. She also points out that slow productivity growth has been holding down wage rises. Asked about regulatory issues, Yellen replies that the Fed has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively light\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regulatory agenda at present. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing we need to get out right now, she adds. Yellen is asked about the possibility of a border tax. She says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd how the dollar would be affected by such a move. Q: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement today says that your inflation target is symmetric - so how high would you be happy to see inflation rise? Two percent inflation is not a ceiling, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a target, Yellen replies. There will be times when it will be above that target. If inflation appears to be persistently over target, though, the Fed would have to take action. Q: What message are you trying to send to US consumers with this interest rate hike? Great question, Yellen replies, before declaring: The simply message is that the economy is doing well She adds that the Fed has confidence in the economy, and its resilience to shocks. The labor market is strengthening - although obviously not everyone is feeling the benefits. Yellen is asked about calls for a new Glass-Steagall Act (to prohibit commercial banks getting involved in risky investment banking). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what a 21st century Glass-Steagall would look like,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen replies wryly. But she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the repeal of Glass-Steagall (during Bill Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency) was a major factor causing the financial crisis. Q: The latest GDP figures weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very impressive, unemployment hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed much, and consumer spending isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t roaring - so why do you feel forced to raise interest rates today? Yellen replies that GDP is quite a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnoisy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 indicator. Other economic data suggests the economy continues to strengthen. Q: So what if the economy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strengthen? Might you raise rates less rapidly than you expect? Policy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t preset, Yellen replies, and it depends on the data*. The Fed will act in a way that encourages further job creation while bringing the real interest rate back towards its neutral level. * - unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnoisy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, I guess.... Q: Are you worried about the consequences if Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tax cuts and spending increases aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enacted? Yellen says there is an obvious, notable shift in sentiment - but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign that this has translated into higher spending. The Fed is watching closely in case this changes. On the global economy, Yellen says the situation has improved. But there are still uncertainties, which G20 finance ministers and central bankers will discuss at their meeting this weekend. Yellen is asked about the recent strong stock market rally. She says that the higher level of equities has helped to ease financial conditions. Frances Donald of Manulife Asset Management believes Yellen will be pleased to see the dollar falling. But John Kicklighter of DailyFX isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the language changes in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter. Q: What do you think the neutral real rate of borrowing costs is? Yellen says that lower productivity, and population increases, means that the neutral rate is lower than in the past. Q: Have you met with new Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin since he was appointed? And have you met Donald Trump? Yellen says she has met Mnuchin a couple of times, and fully expects to have a strong relationship with him. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very brief meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the president, and appreciated that opportunity. Q: Has the Federal Reserve considered the implications of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus plan? Yellen says they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not discussed it, as there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the character and size of potential policy changes. Q: Why did you remove the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 before the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradual increases in interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relatively small change, Yellen says. Our forecasts for the economy and the federal funds rate are virtually unchanged. Q: You warned that if the Fed were to waiting too long to raise rates, it could be forced into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd increase in rates. What would this look like? Yellen says that she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really say what a rapid rate of increases would be. But three rate hikes in a year is certainly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Onto questions. Q: What conditions does the Fed want to see before it starts to normalise its balance sheet? (ie, selling some of the assets bought under its stimulus programme since the financial crisis). Yellen says the Fed favours using interest rates, rather than balance sheet adjustments, as their primary tool right now. She points out that the Fed could use its balance sheet if interest rates were cut back down to their lowest possible levels (the zero lower bound). And the Fed will want to be confident in the strength of the economy before starting to shrink the balance sheet. The economic outlook is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Yellen continues, adding that policy is not on a preset course. Monetary policy is still accommodative, after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rises, Yellen says. She warns that if the Fed were to wait too long before normalising policy, it could be forced to raise borrowing costs more rapidly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sometime down the road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, causing disruptions in the financial markets. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level of interest rates is lower than the historical average. Yellen sounds confident about the labor market, saying Fed policymakers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expect that job conditions with strengthen somewhat further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen says that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike is in response to the ongoing recovery in the US economy, and improved conditions in the labor market. Our decision to make another gradual reduction...reflects the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued progress toward its employment/price stability objectives, the Fed chair explains. Fed chair Janet Yellen is holding a press conference to explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. You can watch it live here: You might expect a currency to strengthen when its central bank raises interest rates. But not today. The dollar is now down almost 1 cent against the euro, at $1.068. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost more than one cent against the pound, which is trading at $1.226. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon UK , says Janet Yellen has delived what Wall Street expected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong economic and job data from the US has only increased calls on Yellen to hike interest rates, so it is no surprise to see the rise today. Investors will now keep a close eye on the forward look for indications on when the next UK rate rises are scheduled, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US increase adds momentum to the case for this. Significantly, the Federal Reserve has also stated that its inflation target is symmetric. In layman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms, that means it is prepared to tolerate prices rising faster than its 2% target. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dovish signal (which explains why the dollar has fallen) Wall Street likes what it sees! The Dow Jones index has now jumped by 86 points to 20,929, a gain of 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500, and the tech-focused Nasdaq index, are both up. The dollar, though, is sinking. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the Fed hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken a hawkish line and predicted more rate hikes in 2017 or 2018. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement shows that the Fed still believes that the US economy continues to recover, and can cope with higher borrowing costs. It says that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfixed investment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by US firms appears to have firmed; that indicates that companies are confident about growth prospects. It also expects inflation to stabilise around its 2% target in the medium term - a sign that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intent to hike rates aggressively. The Fed also says that the near-term risks to the US economy are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcroughly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a key section of the report: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment appears to have firmed somewhat. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the new Fed dot plot, showing where policymakers expect interest rates to be over the next few years. There are a few minor moves, but the bottom line is that the Fed still expects three rate hikes this year, and in 2018. The Federal Reserve still expects to raise interest rates three times this year (including today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move). The decision to raise US interest rates is not unanimous, though! Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, argued against a rate hike. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been arguing that there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough pressure on wages to justify a hike. The other nine policymakers outvoted Kashkari, though, and decided a rate hike was needed. Breaking! The Federal Reserve has voted to raise US interest rates at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The Fed has responded to the latest solid economic data by hiking borrowing costs by a quarter of one percent. That moves the Federal Funds rate up to 0.75% to 1.0% (up from 0.5% to 0.75%) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first interest rate rise in 2017 (the last one was in December), and only the third since the financial crisis struck. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shock Wall Street, as most economists had predicted a hike today. But everyone is now racing to read the statement, and to prepare for Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in 30 minutes time. More to follow! Not everyone is excited, though.... The excitement is building.... This was the scene on Wall Street a little while ago, as traders got ready for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on interest rates: With a rate hike widely expected, the real questions are: How dovish or hawkish will Fed chair Janet Yellen sound? Will the Fed change its prediction for three rate rises this year? Will Yellen comment on Donald Trump? Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says investors will look closely at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 produced by the Fed, showing how policymakers expect borrowing costs to rise. The Fed is a pussy-cat that would like to change its spots into something more like a leopard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. In practical terms, that means that this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC announcement (6pm GMT, with a press conference half an hour later) is all about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections rather than whether they raise rates or not. Anything other than a 25bp rate hike would be a huge surprise to the market Discounting that possibility on the grounds that the Fed is so (too) obsessed with managing market expectations ahead of policy moves, what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll watch are the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 showing FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections of where Fed Funds might go. Market pricing of Fed Funds through 2017-19 is at the bottom end of what the Fed currently projects. Our US economists think that the 2017/18 dots probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move but beyond that, an upward adjustment is possible to send a signal to the market that the FOMC is serious about normalising policy. While we wait for the Fed rate decision, this piece in the FT (\u00c2\u00a3) entitled Brexit means the end of single market access for London is an interesting read. Christian Noyer, the former chairman of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Banque de France, writes: Will London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial institutions lose access to the single market after the UK leaves the EU? When one looks at the legal framework, underlying logic and, in particular, precedents from the European Economic Area, the answer is yes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit means Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are three conditions for full access to the EU single market and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for financial institutions. First, implementation of EU regulations under the control of the European Court of Justice; second, payment of a sizeable contribution to the EU budget; and third, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four freedoms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A country refusing to meet these conditions cannot be part of the EU single market because it rejects the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s logic. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as simple as that. Some observers, however, believe they can secure entry through the back door after exiting through the front. It is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free access on the basis of regulatory equivalence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is worth noting that, if this were truly possible, the foundations of the single market would be undermined, a key element of EU cohesion would be destroyed and the entire EEA concept would probably die. European stock markets have now closed. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.15% to 7368.64 The Dax in Frankfurt rose 0.18% to 12,009.87 The CAC in Paris rose 0.23% to 4,985.48 The Ibex in Madrid rose 0.79% to 9,983.20 The FTSE MiB in Milan rose 1.2% to 19,774.02 Renaultgate? Shares in the French carmaker fell today after a French newspaper report claimed its vehicles were equipped with software allowing them to cheat in pollution tests. Lib\u00c3\u00a9ration said it had obtained an investigative document from the economy ministry, which indicated that two models \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Renault Captur and the Clio IV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spewed emissions more than 300% above the legal limit in real-life conditions. Renault described the article as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but declined to comment further, saying it had no access to the confidential investigation. As a consequence, Renault cannot confirm the veracity, completeness and reliability of the information published in the said article. Renault will prove its compliance with the regulations and reserves its explanations for the judges in charge of investigating this case. The company said its vehicles had met regulatory standards and stressed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they are not equipped with cheating software affecting anti-pollution systems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. French prosecutors said in January that they would look into possible cheating by Renault, after independent experts found high levels of diesel emissions at several carmakers, including Renault. Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premises were also raided, in the aftermath of the Volkswagen emissions scandal in September 2015. The German carmaker admitted to installing software in its vehicles to cheat US diesel emissions tests. Renault recalled 15,000 cars last year over excessive levels of harmful gases, but the company insisted there was no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing. In London, gains on the FTSE 100 are led by oil and mining firms, keeping the index close to its recent all-time high. But this could change after the Fed decision. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said: Indeed, European and UK equities have been more resilient of late than their US counterparts, with some of this down to weaker domestic currencies. The risk for the likes of the FTSE and the Dax is therefore that a less hawkish Fed tonight could spike a rally for sterling and the euro, causing some of the most recent outperformance to reverse. Overall today has felt like a market that is in dire need of a catalyst, so traders will be hoping that Janet Yellen provides just that. On currency markets, the dollar slipped after the disappointing retail sales data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite expectations of a rate hike from the Fed later today. There are question marks over the rate outlook further out, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal policy. The dollar index drifted 0.2% lower. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dot plots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its interest rate projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently suggest three rate hikes this year but there is concern that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language may sound more dovish than before. The pound earlier hit its highest level this week, of $1.2258, recovering from an eight-week low yesterday caused by fears of a drawn-out Brexit. Sterling is now trading at $1.2218, up 0.5%. The euro is also up against the dollar, trading 0.25% higher at $1.0628. Concerns about the outcome of the Dutch parliamentary elections today were offset by market speculation that the European Central Bank may soon unwind its stimulus programme. Markets are calm ahead of the eagerly awaited Fed decision, with European stock markets holding on to their gains. FTSE 100 in London up 0.2% Dax in Frankfurt up 0.2% CAC in Paris up 0.25% Ibex in Madrid up 0.9% FTSE MiB in Milan up 1% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is 0.2% ahead while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq is flat. Brent crude has gained 1.3%, to $51.61 a barrel, after data showed US crude stocks fell last week following nine consecutive increases. The International Energy Agency said global inventories rose in January for the first time despite the Opec output cuts. But if the oil cartel sticks to its production curbs, the IEA predicted a deficit of 500,000 barrels a day for the first half of this year. Also, delays in processing tax refunds by the US government weighed on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to spend in February. Compared with February last year, retail sales were up 5.7%. Inflation in the US hit a five-year high last month, rising to 2.7%, as we reported earlier. At the same time, retail sales weakened, as households bought fewer cars and cut back on discretionary spending, according to the latest data published today. Retail sales rose just 0.1% in February, the weakest reading since August, suggesting the economy lost some momentum in the first quarter. Analysts weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned, though, noting that January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was revised higher to a 0.6% rise from 0.4%. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: Overall, inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough. Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today. Jane Sydenham, investment director of Rathbones Investment Management, says that because a Fed rate hike at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting has already been priced in, the impact on markets is likely to be small. After flag waving for more than a year, it would be surprising if Yellen didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the opportunity to raise rates today, especially in light of all the positive data. Facing such a known unknown, markets have almost certainly priced this in and the impact is likely to be minimal. What investors need to be more mindful of is that this may be just the first of three possible rate rises this calendar year, but other rises will be dependent on continuing strength in economic data and an inflation rate that remains at a manageable level. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at brokerage Xtrade, believes that tonight will mark the beginning of a series of Fed rate hikes, and the Bank of England could soon follow suit. The way the US economy is moving at the moment, we can see the Fed raising interest rates at least three, if not four, times this year. Although, if Donald Trump gets his way then it will almost certainly be the latter. Business in the US is arguably strong enough to dust off rates up to 2% this year, but Janet Yellen will be wary of moving too fast with plenty of political uncertainty still circling in Europe. As soon as the Fed moves today, the BoE may not be too far behind. Raising rates amidst the uncertainty of Brexit is of course risky, but with inflation soaring an April rate hike looks about right. Sam Fleming of the FT has written a preview of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: It would now be a significant shock if the US central bank did not lift the target range for the federal funds rate by another quarter point from the current 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent. The chances of a move were seen by markets at around 95 per cent going into the meeting, according to a CME Group analysis of futures prices. So the issue for investors is judging whether the next move could come as soon as June and whether there is the possibility of four increases this year, rather than the three predicted in December. Either way, the Fed is still likely to characterise its rate-raising plans as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Over in New York, shares are rising at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are all showing modest gains, as investors get ready for the Federal Reserve meeting. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says the rise in US inflation (see earlier post) means a rate rise is even more likely today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show inflation climbed to a five-year high for the second consecutive month, reinforcing strong expectations of a Fed interest rate hike on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under current levels of inflationary pressures, Janet Yellen has little choice but to pencil in a first rate when the Fed convenes later today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, it remains a question of how many hikes we will see this year, with investors fretting over the prospect of four.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has hit its highest level since March 2012, underlining why US interest rates are likely to rise later today. The US consumer prices index rose by 2.7% year-on-year in February, up from 2.5% in January. On a monthly basis, prices crept up by 0.1%. Nothing here to scare the Federal Reserve away from raising interest rates in five hours time, I suspect. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott, on the worrying slowdown in wage growth: Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%. These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay. The reasons for this transformation is obvious: deindustrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the public sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is subject to a 1% pay cap. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angela Monaghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to its joint lowest level since 1975 but wage growth also slowed in a sign of the fresh squeeze in living standards facing UK households. The jobless rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to January from 4.8% in the previous three months, matching the rate last seen in 2005. It was last lower in the three months to August 1975, when it was 4.6% according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite the fall, total pay including bonuses slowed sharply from 2.6% to 2.2%, the lowest since early 2016. Real pay growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adjusted for inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was just 0.7%, the weakest in more than two years. The employment rate was unchanged at 74.6%, the highest since records began in 1971.... More here: Some reaction to Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handbrake turn on the NICs increase: I wonder if Philip Hammond is now regretting making that joke about his predecessor, Norman Lamont, getting sacked..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he said during last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gag-filled Budget speech: The Treasury has helpfully reminded me that I am not the first Chancellor to announce the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153last spring Budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Twenty four-years ago Norman Lamont also presented what was billed then as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last Spring Budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He reported on an economy that was growing faster than any other in the G7, and he committed to continued restraint in public spending. The then Prime Minister described it as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right budget, at the right time, from the right Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What they failed to remind me was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6ten weeks later, he was sacked! So wish me luck! Good luck Philip! Oh my goodness! Philip Hammond, the UK chancellor, has just ditched his plan to raise tax rates on the self-employed. In a very embarrassing u-turn, Hammond has decided to abandon his proposed changes to Class Four National Insurance Contributions, announced in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. This follows a stream of protests from Conservative MPs, especially as the party had promised NOT to raise national insurance rates in its manifesto for the 2015 election Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter announcing the change: Hammond is due to speak to MPs about this change of heart, around 2.30pm. Our Politics Live blog will be tracking it: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that the UK employment total rose by 92,000 in the last three months, to a new record high of 31.854m. Employment Minister Damian Hinds says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good sign: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delighted by another set of record-breaking figures showing more people in work than ever before and unemployment falling to its lowest in 12 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment is up, wages are up and there are more people working full-time. This is good news for hard-working families across the UK as we continue to build a country that works for everyone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we have more to do, which is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pressing ahead with our welfare reforms to ensure that it always pays to be in work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The recovery in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs sector in recent years has not been shared equally across the country. This chart, from the Resolution Foundation, shows how some parts of the country have enjoyed strong growth creation, while others are lagging. The drop in real wage growth, to just 0.8%, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns the Resolution Foundation. Laura Gardiner, their senior policy analyst, fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short-lived pay recovery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could end soon. Weak pay rises and rising inflation mean that a fresh squeeze is due later this year, and has already begun for some workers, especially in the public sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incredibly poor outlook for pay has pushed a return to pre-crash earnings back well into the next parliament, making the 2010s the weakest decade for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is also concerned by the weak pay growth. He believes it will prevent the Bank of England raising interest rates this year. Regular pay growth was disappointing at just 2.3%, and with inflation rising, a squeeze on real household incomes is a major reason why we expect economic growth to slow this year. We expect the MPC to keep interest rates on hold until 2019 at the earliest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A couple more charts from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: The drop in average earnings (ex bonuses) to 2.3% per year in November-January means that real wage growth has dropped again. UK inflation was 1.2% in November, 1.6% in December, and a blistering 1.8% in January. So real wage growth was actually only around 0.8%. Inflation is likely to have jumped again in February (we find out next week) John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, fears that inflation could overtake wage growth this year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK jobs growth was more robust than expected in the three months to January, rising by over 90,000 compared to the previous three months. The momentum of jobs growth actually looks somewhat stronger now than a few months ago, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7%, its lowest level since 1975. For the moment, the jobs market remains in fine fettle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was less good news on average earnings growth, which fell back to just 2.2% in the three months to January. With consumer price inflation already up to 1.8% in January and set to rise further over the coming months, real earnings growth could be back in negative territory by the end of 2017. This is likely to dampen consumer spending, which could eventually feed through into slower jobs growth as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the UK labour market seems to be in good shape: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market is going from strength to strength, with the number of people in work continuing to rise and unemployment also falling. But Thiru also expects unemployment to rise in the months ahead, while wage growth stalls: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK labour market conditions may cool over the next few years as the expected slowdown in growth and the rising burden of upfront business costs stifle firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hiring intentions. That said, we expect that the UK unemployment rate will reach a peak of 5.3% next year, still some way below the historical average. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, average pay growth continues to slow, and it appears increasingly likely that inflation will outstrip earnings growth in the coming months, which will put further pressure on consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending power. The number of self-employed people in the UK is rising faster than the number of employed workers, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows. The ONS reports that in the last year: employees increased by 144,000 to 26.83 million (84.2% of all people in work) self-employed people increased by 148,000 to 4.80 million (15.1% of all people in work) Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at Lancaster University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work Foundation, says the rise in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 jobs (such as delivery drivers) is responsible: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour market statistics show a large rise in employment and a fall in unemployment (with the rate down to 4.7%). The big gain has come from full-time self-employment - a rise of some 94000 on the quarter - perpetuating the apparent ascendancy of the gig economy. Professor Johnes is also concerned that wage growth dropped again: to just 2.2% year on year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the last quarter of 2016 there was a large rise in employment in construction - some 36000 new jobs in this sector. The fall in unemployment is patchy across regions, with the latest regional data indicating increases in both London and the West Midlands. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Increases in total pay, however, continue to be moderate, with the three month average now growing at an annual rate of 2.2% (down from 2.6% last month). Specifically in construction, the rate of growth has collapsed, and this may be an early sign that the employment growth in that sector may not last.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Technically, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate is now at its joint lowest for 42 years. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.7% in 2005. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been lower since the heady days of 1975, the year Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail hit the screens. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report (which is online here) Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to its joint lowest level since 1975, at 4.7% in the three months to January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 4.8% a month ago, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from The Office for National Statistics. It suggests that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been hit badly by the Brexit vote. But.... wage growth has slowed sharply. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, only rose by 2.3% year-on-year - down from 2.6% a month ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even worse than expected, and means that real wage growth has taken another hit. Including bonuses, average earnings only rose by 2.2% - the weakest rise since April 2016. More details and reaction to follow! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of how real pay growth (wages minus inflation) has slowed in the last few months: Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, believes European investors will be crossing their fingers and hoping that the liberal VVD party led by Mark Rutte wins the most seats in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch election. Hiscott says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch elections could be yet another watershed moment for Europe, leading to further political fragmentation. With a country known for its liberal traditions, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been surprising that Geert Wilders and his PVV party have managed to assert themselves so much, taking the lead at some point in the last few weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most recently though the VVD - the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Party for Freedom &amp; Democracy - has re-taken the lead and investors looking for stability in the financial markets will welcome this. The possibility of the PVV coming to power, with its anti-EU stance, could have had a dramatically effect on the EUR FX and Dutch equities markets, both largely negative. But as I flagged up earlier, the Dutch voting system - and its fragmented politics - means a coalition government is all-but certain. And with all the other main parties vowing not to work with Wilders, the blonde populist could be thwarted. Duncan Robinson of the FT has done a good preview: European stock markets are up across the board this morning. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.2% to 7,373 points - less than 20 points shy of its all-time high. That suggests investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too anxious about the UK jobs report, or the US rate decision. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx suspects traders will be watching the Dutch election closely: There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot for the region to do today, so any political news out of the Netherlands might be its main driver of movement as Wednesday progresses. Analyst Jens Bastian points out that the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political drama has implications for the rest of Europe. It could slow down the process of handing more bailout money to Greece: (not that Greece and her creditors have reached an agreement on its bailout programme) The pound is having a good morning, jumping almost one cent against the US dollar to $1.223. Some traders are attributing the rise to a report in The Times today, which argues that the Bank of England should consider raising interest rates soon. The Times runs its own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshadow monetary policy committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which gives its own views on what the BoE ought to do. And three of its members believe rates need to rise now, back to 0.5%, to address the jump in inflation. Another three reckon rates should rise in April. Charles Goodhart, a former Bank ratesetter, argues that the Bank should send a signal when it announces this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, tomorrow: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They should lay the ground in the accompanying minutes for a possible increase in interest rates at their next meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chance that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate could hit a new 11-year low of 4.7% today, down from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to RBC Capital Markets, who also predict that wage growth will slow. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong report emphatically removed the skew of risks on the unemployment rate rising from 4.8% to 4.9%. Indeed, if anything, the skew of risks on this occasion is that it could actually drop to 4.7% but our central expectation is that unemployment holds at 4.8% for a fifth consecutive month. The 3m/3m employment level looks set to post a healthy gain too as the recently softness provides a relatively easy comparator for the latest data. The 37k 3m/3m gain last time should well at least be matched on this occasion. For average earnings we look for growth to ease to 2.4% 3m/y for both the including and excluding bonus measures from 2.6% 3m/y last time. This would be consistent with the message from the Bank of England Agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recent survey on pay settlements which pointed towards growth slowing from 2.7% on average in 2016 to 2.2% for 2017 More than eight years after bailing Lloyds Banking Group out, the British government has taken another step towards the exit door. The UK has sold another slice of Lloyds shares, taking its stake below the 3% level. According to the Treasury, this means taxpayers have recovered over \u00c2\u00a319.5bn of the \u00c2\u00a320.3bn which they put into Lloyds, once share sales and dividends received are accounted for. Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Kirby, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lloyds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recent annual results show that we are in a good position to reduce our shareholding further and expect to recover all of the money taxpayers injected into the bank during the financial crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers like to avoid surprising the markets. So with everyone expecting a US interest rate rise tonight, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason for the Federal Reserve to worry about announcing its first hike of 2017. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite a simple as that. Investors across the globe want to know how rapidly the Fed will act this year - is it still expecting three rate hikes this year? Might we only see two, or should traders brace for as many as four? That means we could see market volatility when the Fed releases its statement, and when Janet Yellen faces the press. We have to wait a few hours for this excitement, though: 2pm EDT/6pm GMT: Fed interest rate decision 2.30pm EDT/6.30pm GMT: Press conference with Fed chair Janet Yellen But in the meantime, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market at 9.30am. Economists expect that the UK unemployment rate will remain at just 4.8% in the thee months to January, its lowest since the financial crisis. But the wages figures could show a slight slowdown, with average earnings (excluding bonuses) tipped to rise by 2.5% per year, down from 2.6% last month. That would be a worry, given inflation is picking up. Also coming up: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election day in the Netherlands. Can far-right leader Geert Wilders notch up another win for the populists and beat mainstream rivals, such as PM Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VVD? Results are expected in the early hours of Thursday. No party is likely to win a majority meaning it could take weeks for a coalition to be agreed. European stock markets are expected to rise modestly in early trading.",

                "bodyText":"Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has set a new closing high. Relief over the Dutch election result, and the dovish comments from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve last night, drove shares higher in London today. The news of a split at the Bank of England over interest rates didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spoil the party either. So the Footsie ended the day up 47 points at 7415, beating the previous closing high of 7382 set on March 1st. Mining stocks led the risers, showing optimism for global growth. The pound is also up today -- trading 0.75 of a cent higher at $1.236. That pulled the FTSE 100 back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday high of 7,444 points (set before the Bank of England revealed that policymaker Kristin Forbes had voted to raise interest rates). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Though Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the BoE will be raising rates anytime soon, especially since she leaves the institution in June, with inflation creeping ever higher it does perhaps nudge the MPC closer to a hawkish position. The pound certainly thought so, at least, rising half a percent against the dollar to a 2 week high having been in the red by the same amount earlier in the day after the Queen gave her Royal Assent for the triggering of Article 50. Other European markets have also romped ahead, helping the Stoxx 600 index to close 0.6% higher. The Amsterdam market closed at its highest level since December 2007. The AEX index finished 0.4% higher tonight as traders digested the news that prime minister Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VVD party had beaten far-right Geert Wilders to first place in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Steve Ruffley, chief market strategist at InterTrader, points out that the markets have defied predictions of sharp losses if Britain voted to leave the EU, or if Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Nine months ago, we were warned that Brexit may knock the markets by 10%, if Trump became president maybe they may fall 20%, yet here we stand at record levels. The explanation for this is easy. The world has gone mad. Last night we saw the Fed finally start the path of normalisation on rate with a hike. Predicted to be 1 of 4 but most likely 3. In traditional economic models hikes in rates send markets down. Not in the new exciting world of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno news is bad news for stocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. On the serious side investors, with a lack of alternatives (interest on cash) have forgotten stocks are a risky investment. What goes up will come down. Ruffley added that 7,500 points is the new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpsychological testing point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the FTSE 100, suggesting it will continue to rise. Selling new highs is not the strategy in this new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstocks at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrapping up for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. See you tomorrow. GW With 30 minutes to go, the FTSE 100 is on track to end the day at a new closing high. The jump in the pound at noon today, when the Bank of England interest rate decision hit the wires, has pulled down share prices a little. The blue-chip index is currently up 37 points at 7,406. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday high of 7,444 points, but still above the previous record close. Greek counter-terrorism officials are investigating whether the letter bomb sent to the IMF was dispatched from a post office in the Greek capital, insiders say. One tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All post offices have been ordered to go back through their files,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The blast occurred a day after the Greek urban guerrilla group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb sent to the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble on Wednesday. The suspicious parcel laced with the sort of explosive used in fireworks was intercepted by German authorities before it reached its recipient. A message posted on the Indymedia Athens anarchist site says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We take responsibility for sending the booby trapped parcel to the Germany finance minister.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek intelligence officials are working on the assumption that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast may have been orchestrated by the same group. Greek anarchist groups have recently racheted up criticism of the demands made of Greece by the IMF. Security is tight outside the IMF offices near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris this afternoon, as police investigate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exploding letter. Over in New York, animal rights campaigners are protesting outside the stock exchange. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unhappy that Canada Goose, the retail chain that uses fur on some of its winter coats, has floated on the stock exchange today. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather less action inside the stock exchange, though. After jumping last night, the Dow Jones index is becalmed this morning, down just 0.07%. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has confirmed that one of her colleagues was injured in an explosion at its Paris offices (seemingly caused by a letter bomb). She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been informed about the explosion in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris office, which caused injuries to one of our staff. I have been in touch with the office, and my compassion goes to the colleagues there. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate. We are working closely with the French authorities to investigate this incident and ensure the safety of our staff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Adam Chester, head of economics at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, points out traders now expect the first UK interest rate rise to come a little sooner than before: Early reaction has seen the pound and UK government bond yields spike higher. The pound has rallied back above $1.2350 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.15, and 10-year government bond yields have risen around 7bp to 1.26%. In the money markets, expectations are now fully priced to a rise in UK interest rates by the end of 2018, compared with early 2019 before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split, City economists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect UK interest rates to rise anytime soon. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, points out that Kristin Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term on the MPC soon expires: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As expected, the Bank of England have left policy unchanged. GDP growth in the first quarter looks to have been close to their forecast, with some signs of a slowdown in household spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A reduction in the equilibrium unemployment rate, supported by a softening in wage pressures in the latest Labour Market Report, suggests interest rates will remain on hold for now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dissenting vote by Kristin Forbes will have come as a surprise to some, although she is a well-known hawk on the committee, who will be leaving this summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warns savers to expect little help from the BoE: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Bank of England is showing no signs of blinking in the course it has charted for monetary policy. Inflation may be starting to rise, but interest rates are staying put for the foreseeable future, which is going to cause further pain for cash savers. Households face a currency crunch this year, as weaker sterling feeds through into consumer prices, pushing up the cost of living, while pay growth still looks anaemic. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says a rate hike would have hurt struggling families: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest freeze is no surprise, the Bank of England won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t budge on interest rates for a while yet. With our world thrown into uncertainty by Brexit, wage growth stalling and inflation creeping up they need to tread carefully even with the drop in unemployment. A rate rise today would have put extra pressure on household finances and queued up trouble by stopping stretched households spending at a time when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important they continue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kallum Pickering of Berenberg predicts that interest rates will stay on hold for at least another year: As our base case, we look for a 25bp first rate hike in the second quarter of 2018, with a 30% chance the BoE raises the bank rate earlier.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the first hike, the BoE will likely continue to proceed with extra caution, with small and infrequent rate hikes signalled far in advance, and with a strong bias toward remaining in neutral as and when risks to growth surface. The pound has hit a two-week high, on the back of the split at the Bank of England. Sterling jumped nearly a cent when the results of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting hit the wires, to $1.235 for the first time since 28 February. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Professor Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to push for a rate hike has driven the pound up. Like the Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England decided to keep its monetary policy unchanged. BUT it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a unanimous decision as Kristin Forbes voted for a 25 basis point rise amid concerns over inflation. This caused the pound to jump across the board. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes show that eight members of the MPC voted to leave interest rates on hold because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the UK economy is strong enough to stomach a rate hike. Pay growth had remained subdued, consistent with the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that some slack remained in the labour market, and there had been some signs that the squeeze in households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real income growth was feeding through into spending, as expected. In this context, the conditioning assumption that had underpinned the February projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that there would be some modest withdrawal of monetary stimulus over the course of the forecast period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remained appropriate. The potential for uncertainty over future trading arrangements to affect materially economic decision making remained, posing a downside risk to the activity outlook, to which the Committee could respond if necessary. On the other hand, with inflation rising sharply, and only mixed evidence on slowing activity domestically, some members noted that it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted. But they also show that Kristin Forbes is rather concerned about inflation; with unemployment at a joint 42-year low, she argued that a rate hike was justified. For one member, the monetary policy trade-off had evolved to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate. Inflation was rising quickly and was likely to remain above target for at least three years. Measures of domestically generated inflation had also increased notably and, combined with global reflation and minimal labour market slack, posed upside risks to inflation. On the other side of the trade-off, the weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised. Unemployment showed no signs of increasing. Although consumer spending appeared to be softening, as expected, growth was likely to be supported by other components of demand, such as net exports. Therefore, for this member, there was less justification for tolerating inflation above the target for an extended period, although monetary policy should remain nimble. The Bank of England has warned that inflation is likely to smash over its target this summer, partly thanks to higher energy bills. The minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting show that policymakers are bracing for the consumer prices index to hit its 2% soon (possibly even next week), and keep rising. The BoE says: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 1.8% in January, fractionally below Bank staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation at the time of the February Inflation Report, in part owing to weaker clothing and footwear prices, which were typically volatile. Since the time of the previous Report, a number of domestic utility providers had announced increases in gas and electricity prices that were somewhat in excess of the baseline assumptions factored into the February forecast. The net result of the news in the January CPI outturn, recent utility price announcements, and the decline in the sterling oil price was to leave the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation for CPI inflation broadly similar to the February projection. CPI inflation was expected to rise to around the 2% target over the next month or so, and, given the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation, to exceed the target materially by the summer. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction from City experts: Kristen Forbes is the first MPC member to vote to raise UK interest rates in over a year. The previous lone hawk was Ian McCafferty in January 2016. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that Forbes leaves the BoE in June - so she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have many more opportunities to vote for a hike. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen writes: The Bank of England has held interest rates at their record low but its policy committee was split on the decision with one member, Kristin Forbes, voting to raise borrowing costs immediately. Eight members of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee (MPC) felt that the current 0.25% base rate and electronic money-printing programme were appropriate to support the post-referendum economy amid signs that slower pay growth and rising inflation was dampening consumer spending. But Forbes, who leaves the committee at the end of June, felt inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was rising quickly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and was likely to remain above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.0% target for at least three years. Minutes from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting showed Forbes also felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showed no signs of increasing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As such, she voted against the rest of the committee and advocated an increase in the base rate back to 0.5%. It is the first split on the MPC since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in July 2016, when Jan Vlieghe had voted for a cut in interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. The rest of the MPC opposed him but then voted for a cut in August 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official tweet: Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of just 0.25%. But in a major surprise, one member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Kristin Forbes, has voted to raise interest rates back to 0.5%. Forbes was outvoted by the other eight members of the committee, though. The Bank has also left its asset purchase scheme (quantitative easing) unchanged at \u00c2\u00a3435bn. More to follow! Newsflash: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid for Sky being referred to media regulator Ofcom. The UK government has asked regulators to investigate whether the \u00c2\u00a311.7bn deal, launched last December, would give the media mogul too much influence over the UK news landscape. Ofcom must now also judge whether Murdoch family are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd owners of the company, following the phone-hacking scandal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Brexit continues to loom over the UK economy today. Supermarket chain Sainsbury has warned that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum continues to create uncertainty: And Toyota accompanied its new \u00c2\u00a3240m investment in the UK with a call for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ontinued tariff- and barrier-free market access\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Europe. Newsflash: there are reports of an explosion at the offices of the International Monetary Fund in Paris. In less than 40 minutes, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on interest rates. The City widely expects the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to leave borrowing costs at the current record low of 0.25%. However, the minutes of the meeting may show some more hawkish policymakers making noises about reversing last August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate cut, following the Brexit vote. With the Dutch election over, City traders are now refocusing their attention on the French polls in late April. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, Caxton FX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency market analyst, says the euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ou of the woods yet: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incumbent candidate, Mark Rutte, was victorious in the Dutch elections. While Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party secured second place, he is unlikely to be part of the coalition government. The euro strengthened on the results. Markets had feared that a victory for Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party could lend support to populist candidates in other European elections. A turn to populism in Europe could call into question the strength of the EU and the euro. Traders will be closely watching the French and German elections. Any causes for concern could test euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent lows. French centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron is extending his lead in the betting market -- but votes in the ballot boxes are what counts. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at OFX, says last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise is still moving the markets today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As far as the markets were concerned, the Dutch election result was somewhat of a relief, and damp squib. The euro has reacted positively to Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win, or at least it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been well supported since the result. The Fed decision and statement last night got more of a reaction - Yellen was a lot less hawkish than investors were expecting. If you missed it...the key news was that the Federal Reserve still expects to raise interest rates three times in 2017 (including last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hike), rather than getting aggressive and hiking four times. Newsflash: Japanese carmaker Toyota has announced plans to invest \u00c2\u00a3240m in its UK operations. Despite the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU, the Japanese carmarker is planning to upgrade the Burnaston plant near Derby. The money will improve the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness and promote UK supply chain efficiencies, it says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics on the Dutch election: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is continuing to hit record levels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up a stonking 69 points at 7438, up nearly 1% today. Plenty of City experts are commenting on the Dutch elections, and what it means for the eurozone. Darren Ruane, Head of Fixed Income at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first place is boosting share prices today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The results of the Dutch election helped to buoy investment markets following a better-than-expected outcome for mainstream parties. In particular, current Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal Party is projected to take 33 seats in the 150 seat lower house of parliament. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The anti-Islam Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, is seen as a relative loser from the election. Prior to the election, the Freedom Party was a frontrunner in the polls in early January. Given that there is a lack of interest in both the Freedom party to form a coalition with other parties and vice-versa, the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy influence should be limited. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In investment markets, European equities have risen by around 1% in early trade, although some of the optimism is follow-through from an expected US interest rate decision last night. Government bond yields in Europe are trading only marginally lower from overnight levels. Bond markets were forecasting a benign outcome from the Dutch elections, with a very strong gain for Wilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Freedom party required to disrupt markets in a meaningful way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist at Fidelity International, says it could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turning point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the popularity of populist parties \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The poorer than expected performance of Geert Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Freedom Party is good news for the eurozone, with the euro gaining as the results pointed to a clear victory for Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre right VVD party. This is a market positive result, although with a three party coalition looking unviable, a long negotiating period to form a government is likely. This is not helpful for a Greek bailout review. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will of course now turn their attention to France, where the candidacy of the far right Marine Le Pen arguably poses greater risks. To whatever extent this vote is a signal on France, the high turnout and rally around towards the mainstream centre look bad for her. The structure of the French presidential election also create additional obstacles to any far right victory in France. As such, the Dutch result may be remembered as the turning point in the popularity of populism for 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing, says fears that the Netherlands could follow Britain out of the EU have abated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win for the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Party for Freedom and Democracy today dramatically reduces the likelihood of a referendum to leave the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdDespite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outcome, there are still other European elections taking place later this year, and undoubtedly continued political uncertainty in the region. But instead of focusing on politics, we should probably concern ourselves more with the fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising employment continues to propel the eurozone region towards 2% growth. Add in inflation and operational gearing, and growth at a company level starts to look interesting. There are some selected good structural growth stories across Europe. What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learnt from Brexit is that no one knows how key political events are going to transpire, and what the stock markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to those events will be. As investors, it is better to stick to what you do know and focus on a long-term investment horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Pepijn Bergsen of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that mainstream parties still face a battle against populist rivals: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roaring markets, from the Daily Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham: European stock markets have hit their highest level in 15 months, as the Dutch election results calm fears over the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange is romping ahead, hitting its highest level since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. And in London, the FTSE 100 is keeping climbing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up over 50 points at 7423 for the first time ever. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risk appetite returns in spades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the markets. The FTSE 100 index hit a record intra-day high as equity markets responded to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Despite policymakers being more firmly agreed on three hikes this year rather than just two, markets took it as a dovish signal that the Fed is going to only cautiously tighten as the economy improves. The message was that the economy is firing but inflation is not going to be an issue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no hurry to raise rates and that is good news for equities. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of relief too as the Dutch elections showed no strong support for populists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping send the euro to a 5-week high and lifting European equities. A softer dollar is also supporting the risk rally, particularly commodities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index, made up of shares in medium-sized companies, has also just hit a record high. It gained 97 points in early trading to hit 19,061 points, up over 0.4%. Newsflash: Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has held interest rates unchanged at minus 0.75%, and warned that the global economy faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - including Brexit. The SNB says: Chief among these are political uncertainty with respect to the future course of economic policy in the US, upcoming elections in Europe, and the complex exit negotiations between the UK and the EU. Mining stocks are leading the rally in London this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s typically a sign that investors are more optimistic about the global economy (more growth = more demand for iron ore, copper, coal and nickel). Anglo American, the resource giant, is the top riser - after Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal announced he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking a \u00c2\u00a32bn stake in the company. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rather more palatable Dutch election result than feared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has helped boost risk appetite in the markets, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Markets are being allowed to ponder the potential for less populist French and German political outcomes in the months to come while further US stimulus supports both US growth and Fed policy normalisation, in turn helping global growth. Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index of leading shares gained 40 points to hit 7411 points for the first time ever, up over 0.5% this morning. Other European stock markets are also jumping, as relief over the Dutch elections sweeps trading floors in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid. And the Amsterdam stock market has gained 0.8% to its highest level since December 2007. RBC Capital Markets says that the Dutch election result is bolstering hopes that a mainstream candidate will win the French presidential elections this spring The electoral spotlight now moves to France where the first round of voting in the presidential election takes place on Sunday April 23rd with the focus on the prospects of Marine Le Pen. Already markets have begun to take some signals (see above) from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch result that the electoral prospects of anti-EU populist parties may be checked. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says investors are also buying shares on relief that the US Federal Reserve sounded cautious on interest rate policy last night: Investors were looking for Yellen to hint on either 4 rate hikes in total this year or a rate hike sooner than expected, possibly in June in order to further fuel the Dollar rally. On the contrary, the Fed Chief mentioned neither of these possibilities and instead said that the central bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discuss in detail potential policy changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The euro hit a five-week high this morning, touching $1.0746 against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the dollar is weaker across the board, after the US Federal Reserve was more cautious than expected about future interest rate hikes yesterday. But the Dutch election is also a factor. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: It is all over and public has put an end to the nonsense populist concept which started with Brexit. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has comfortably beaten the anti-Islam Freedom party. We have a moment of calm and this has helped the euro to rally as everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Mr Wilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 victory could have provided a tailwind for Marine Le Pen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign in France, which could have put the future of the euro in jeopardy. European government bonds are strengthening this morning, following Geert Wilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to claim first place in the Dutch election. French debt is in demand, as investors take it as a sign that Marine Le Pen might be thwarted in her bid to win the presidency. Reuters has the details: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government bond yields hit a one-week low in early trade on Thursday after results of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch parliamentary elections suggested that populist party PVV would come a distant second to the current ruling party. Dutch centre-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte scored a resounding victory over anti-Islam and anti-EU Geert Wilders in an election on Wednesday. French government bonds were seen as vulnerable to a potential victory for PVV, as France faces its own presidential elections in April and May, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen in with a chance to win the keys to Elysee Palace. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bond yield fell 5 basis points to one-week low of 0.99%. Most other euro zone bond yields were also lower on the day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England Day! Over in Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is putting the finishing touches to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on monetary policy. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a change on interest rates, which are currently at a record low of just 0.25%. But the minutes of the meeting will be poured over for signs that the Bank may be considering whether to tighten policy in response to rising inflation. The decision comes at noon. Analysts at PNC believe that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures, which showed falling pay growth and a rise in self-employment, will encourage the Bank to sit tight for several months. Lower wage growth and a shift to self-employment (possibly a disguised form of underemployment) reinforces our view that slack has increased in the British labor market since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, making a bank rate hike unlikely in 2017. Another reason not to expect a rate hike is that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC believes Brexit will be a headwind to British output over the medium term, for example by reducing market access for British services exports to EU end-markets which account for 5 percent of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be mopping up reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise. As we blogged, the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs to 1%, but maintained a cautious approach to normalising monetary policy. That sparked a rally on Wall Street last night, and Europe is likely to follow suit his morning. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you, Janet Yellen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market message to the U.S. Fed Chair. The greenback [US dollar] is falling while everything else is in green today after the Federal Reserve delivered on its promise to hike rates by 25 basis points. While this move was widely expected, many market participants were positioned for a more hawkish language and an upgrade in economic projections which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen City traders believe the FTSE 100 could hit a new record high! European investors are also digesting the results of the Dutch election. Far-right populist Geert Wilders has failed to claim first place, claiming just 20 seats - behind Mark Rutte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-right VVD party which is set to win 33. That appears to leave VVD clear to form a new coalition; it may take a few weeks, but fears of another populist shock victory can now recede. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know:",

                "bodyText":"Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended a busy week at a new all-time closing high. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a modest rally - the blue-chip index has finished 9 points higher at 7424 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on the new record high of 7447 set this afternoon. Insurance firm Admiral led the risers, up 2%, with medical products maker Convatec and budget airline easyJet close behind. European markets are showing some gains too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX also finished 0.1% higher, while the French CAC gained 0.3%. Investors have taken this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise in their stride -- mainly because the Fed reassured them that borrowing costs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too fast over the next couple of years Relief that the Dutch far-right \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 came second in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election also made for a good week in the City. But there is still plenty for investors to worry about this weekend; Brexit hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone away, and nor have calls for another Scottish vote on independence. Plus, who knows what Donald Trump will do next week? His meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel is underway now, but looks a little awkward... Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons next week should be a little quieter than the last few days - although new UK inflation figures (on Tuesday) will be interesting. The coming week is a quieter one, at least compared to this one. UK CPI and retail sales will ensure that sterling remains a focus of attention, after the pound rallied from its lows thanks to the Fed meeting. However, it looks like we are in for a period of quiet, at least where events are concerned. Stocks remain expensive, but index inflows keep supporting the market, and for now there is no sign of a major dip emerging any time soon. So on that note, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrap up. Hope you have a lovely weekend. GW A gobbet of eurozone news: Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has just reaffirmed Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, with a stable outlook: The OECD has put more pressure on governments to reform their economies, and help more people benefit from faster growth. Otherwise, the think tank warns, they will continue to lose the support and faith of voters. My colleage Katie Allen explains: The report, presented by OECD secretary general Angel Gurria at a meeting of finance ministers from the G20 group of nations in Germany calls on governments to take a long-term view of jobs and skills, infrastructure spending and innovation. It also calls for more focus on tackling inequality to win back public support for reforms. The group, which covers 35 mainly rich countries including the UK, notes that on average only 40% of OECD citizens trust their governments. Newsflash: US consumer confidence continues to grow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the University of Michigan, Its monthly consumer sentiment index has jumped to 97.6 in March, from 96.3 in February. And the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrent conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index, which asks people how their feel about their financial situation today, jumped by three points to 114.5, the highest reading since November 2000. The survey also found that Republicans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than Democrats about expectations for their finances. Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, says: The sentiment data has been characterised by rising optimism as well as by rising uncertainty due to the partisan divide. Optimism promotes discretionary spending, and uncertainty makes consumers more cautious spenders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FTSE 100 is on track to set a closing high for the second day running (on top of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday high). Henry Croft of Accendo Markets reckons investors are ending the week in good heart: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equity markets across the globe are positive as improved risk appetite continues into the weekend, although the pace of gains has slowed as drivers (data/corporate) are light on the ground. Investors are continuing to digest the multiple central bank monetary policy updates this week, including surprising hawkishness from the Bank of England [on Thursday]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 just nudged a new alltime intraday high. The blue-chip index has hit the heady heights of 7447 points, up 30 points today - and two points higher than Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak. Royal Bank of Scotland, the financial institution bailed out by the taxpaper in 2008, is leading the rally - up 2.3% today. Ooooh. Bloomberg are reporting that the G20 finance chiefs have removed a reference to climate change from the statement they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll released on Saturday, at the end of their meeting. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to Germany, the meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s host. It hoped to include a section about climate issues, but there appears to be a major disagreement over the issue. Bloomberg says: Deputies concluded crafting the communique on Thursday evening, and ministers and central-bank governors will debate the document in the German town of Baden-Baden on Friday. The language may still change before the final version is released the next day. Germany is using its year as G-20 president to push for the group to support climate protection. That effort has run into resistance from countries including the U.S., China, India and Saudi Arabia, one G-20 official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were private. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There can be a way to overcome disagreements today -- that is, not writing about it in the communique,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told reporters in the southwestern German spa town on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But not writing about it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean not talking about it. Not writing about it means that there are difficulties, that there is a disagreement and that we we must work on them in the coming months. Over in Baden-Baden, G20 finance ministers are trying to hammer out a statement on free trade. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, told reporters that there were some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensible positions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among delegates on the issue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the exact wording but nobody has raised the issue of protectionism yet and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that we have to deal with this a lot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about finding the right wording, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about how we phrase the openness of the world trade system in the final communique,.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Lukman Otunuga of FXTM Research says the stock market bounce following Wednesday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting is fading. Traders were excited on Wednesday and Thursday that the Fed didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t predict more rate hikes in 2017 and 2018; today, though, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more concerned about the G20 finance ministers meeting in Germany: Otunuga says: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd powered stock market rally slightly cooled off during Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session with investors turning cautious ahead of the anticipated G20 meeting. Asian shares were mostly mixed as participants weighed on the prospects of fewer US interest rates increases this year. In Europe, the defensive trading mood slightly pressured equities and the bearish contagion could limit gains on Wall Street this evening. An explosively volatile trading week is slowly coming to an end with investors turning their attention towards the G20 finance meeting which could offer some insights on how world leaders feel about key topics such as protectionism and global growth. With some discussions of currencies also being a possibility, the Greenback could turn volatile if leaders start to discuss the impacts of its resurgence since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential victory. After a weak start, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are now pushing higher. The FTSE 100 is up 19 points at 7435; a small rise, but only 10 points away from beating yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time intraday high. After the excitement earlier this week (a US rate hike, a split at the Bank of England), the markets seem to be meandering towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says: Looking to the US open and the Dow Jones is set for a quiet start to the session, with the futures suggesting at 10 point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. Now that the Fed rate raise is done and dusted the Dow may struggle to find any meaningful direction in the coming weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, of course, unless Donald Trump (who has been relatively quiet of late) unleashes some kind of market-shaking pronouncement. The eurozone has posted its first trade deficit in the years. Imported goods from the rest of the world surged by 17% year-on-year in January, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac164.5bn, according to Eurostat. Exports rose by 13% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac163.9bn. This left the euro area with a deficit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600m; the first since January 2014. The wider European Union posted a trade in goods deficit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16.2bn in January (partly due to Britain). That included a large trade deficit with China, but a larger surplus with the United States: High demand for energy in the winter months helped to cause Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Imports can also be lifted appreciably in the winter months if colder than usual weather leads to a pick-up in energy imports. However, the weakened traded goods performance in January will make it harder for net trade to contribute positively to Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 after being a drag in the fourth quarter of 2016. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s man in Baden-Baden, Steven Mnuchin, has met with his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso: Mnuchin is expected to push G20 ministers not to deliberately weaken their currencies to win export business - something that Trump gets most irate about. But Aso may not appreciate any criticism; last month he denied that the yen was weak. Mark Carney is also warning that confidence in the financial sector, and trust in the markets, has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years. In his letter to G20 finance chiefs, Carney says the Financial Stability Board is taking steps to make financial benchmarks more trustworthy (after a series of rigging scandals). It is also bolstering codes of conduct across the industry, and change financial institutions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 governance and compensation structures to reduce misconduct risk. Carney also hints that simply slapping multi-billion fines on big banks isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only solution; individuals need to be held to account too. He says: The work recognises that, while fines and sanctions deter misconduct, preventative measures, including those which increase individual accountability, can also play important roles. The FSB is promising to: (i) deliver to G20 Leaders a report drawing together actions taken and recommendations made to address misconduct risk across the various elements of the action plan; and (ii) publish a consultation paper on the use of compensation tools to address misconduct The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system risks suffer serious harm if policymakers fail to implement the measures drawn up to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis, Mark Carney has warned. Carney fired a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchurry-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 towards the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top finance ministers and central bankers as the G20 meeting got underway in Germany. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushing them to tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshadow banking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which takes place away from the regulators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gaze) and risky derivatives trading. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting in his role as head of the Financial Stability Board (the Bank of England governor is wearing two hats in Baden-Baden this weekend) He warned that there \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a risk of a loss of momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in completing, and implementing, international standards. This could lead to fragmented funding and liquidity markets, driving up the cost of finance in the real economy. Carney concludes: A decade on from the start of the crisis, the G20 has made substantial progress in building a financial system that is more resilient and better able to fund households and business in sustainable way. As the global recovery gains strength, now is not the time to risk these hardwon gains. And here are the FSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four priorities to avoid a repeat of the mayhem of 2008. Transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance, including by addressing structural vulnerabilities in asset management; Making derivatives markets safer by progressing the post-crisis reforms to over-the-counter derivatives markets and delivering coordinated guidance on central counterparty resilience, recovery and resolution; Supporting full and consistent implementation of post-crisis reforms, including the development of a structured framework for post-implementation evaluation of the effects of reforms; and Addressing new and emerging vulnerabilities, including misconduct risks, as well as those stemming from the decline in correspondent banking and from climate-related financial risks Some photos from the G20 meeting just landed: Almost five years after being forced out of Barclays over the Libor rate rigging scandal, Bob Diamond has made a dramatic return to the City. Diamond has pulled off an audacious takeover of City stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, through his Atlas Merchant Capital in an alliance with the Qatari royal family. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying a 68% premium for Panmure, which is one of the oldest brokerage in the Square Mile. Analysts believe Diamond could now turn Panmure into a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcboutique\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment bank. In the City, shares in housebuilder Berkeley Group have jumped by 6% this morning after it issued an upbeat trading statement. Profits will be at the top end of expectations, it said, despite a 16% drop in reservations since the Brexit vote. But Tullow Oil have slumped by 15%, after it announced plans for a \u00c2\u00a3607m rights issue to tackle its debt burden. The cash call is priced at a 45% discount to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, prompting this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is pluckily bucking the downward trend this morning: European stock markets have begun the day on the back foot. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is down 0.4% in early trading, as the country prepares to welcome finance ministers and central bank bosses from across the G20. That dragged the wider Stoxx 600 index down by 0.3%, with France and Spain also in the red. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped by 8 points after hitting a record closing high of 7415 last night. Henry Croft, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets, says political drama may drive the markets today: With this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank updates and the Dutch election now in the rear view mirror, in focus today will be a multitude of high level political summits. The US President Donald Trump is hosting the German Chancellor President Angela Merkel, as the leader of the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engine room meets face to face with the outspoken US chief for the first time since he took office. In Europe, Theresa May will address the Conservative Spring Forum around midday - expect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit means Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 soundbites aplenty and potentially some remarks towards the SNP - while the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers in Baden-Baden will likely be headlined by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first appearance on the global stage (trade in focus?) and, of course, the looming challenge of Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders are enjoying a brighter commute to the office this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Spring Equilux - when the days start being longer than the nights, and winter gloom becomes but a memory. However, this new extra daylight may be wasted on us today, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too much actually going on. After rallying yesterday, European stock markets are expected to dip back this morning - as the boost from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch election fades. The economics calendar is a little sparse. 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output for January 2pm GMT: The US consumer confidence report from the University of Michigan 5pm GMT: The weekly Baker Hughes count of US oil rigs in operation Investors may also be watching Washington, where German chancellor Angela Merkel is meeting US president Donald Trump (her visit was delayed by heavy snow on Tuesday). And G20 finance ministers will begin their two-day meeting in Germany; protectionism and free trade will be high on the agenda. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first G20 meeting since taking office. RBC Capital Markets say: Mnuchin is expected to present a softer tone from the US, shying away from the protectionist message of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign trail.",

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the day, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a look at the markets. On Wall Street, markets are mixed now trading is fully underway: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,643 S&amp;P 500: +0.04% at 2,345 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,808 European markets are also mixed, with most indices down less they were earlier. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,330 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.5% at 11,908 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.3% at 4,990 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 19,970 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,232 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 374 Thank you for reading the blog and for commenting. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator for Brexit has set out the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions and priorities for talks. Among the priorities cited were the need for early agreements on citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights, money and borders. Guaranteeing their rights as European citizens, in the long term, will be our absolute priority from the very start of negotiations. Full story coming soon here. The Dutch government has come out in support of Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the Dutch finance minister faced calls to resign as the leader of the Eurogroup. The controversy centres on comments Dijsselbloem made to a German newspaper, which were taken as a criticism of Southern European countries. Specifically: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. Reuters quotes an official close to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte as saying the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains firmly behind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dijsselbloem. The official added: The position has not changed. Premier Rutte has repeatedly said we are very supportive of Dijsselbloem in his role at the Eurogroup. The Portuguese prime minister has called for Dijsselbloem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. Dijsselbloem has not commented. Oil prices are at near four-month lows after the latest figures showed US crude inventories rose faster than expected, exacerbating fears of over supply. Brent crude is down 1.6% at $50.15 a barrel, and fell as low $50.05 earlier, the lowest since 30 November when OPEC countries agreed to cut output to ease oversupply fears. Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 2.8 million. US shale oil producers have been increasing the number of rigs, pushing up production. Analysts at US bank Jefferies commented in a note: OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market intervention has not yet resulted in significant visible inventory drawdowns, and the financial markets have lost patience. Thames Water has been handed a record \u00c2\u00a320.3m fine after huge leaks of untreated sewage. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency, which said the enormous volume of sewage, at 1.4bn litres, was unprecedented. It relates to numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. Full story here: The pound appears to have lost some of the boost it gained from the sharp rise in UK inflation revealed on Tuesday. (The consumer prices index jumped more than expected to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January, pushed higher by food and fuel prices.) The pound is still above $1.24 but down 0.3% on the day at $1.2440. It is also down 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1516. Wall Street will be closely monitoring any developments in the debate on the Republican health care bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday, and failure to pass it would be a huge blow to Trump. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off... US markets have opened lower, but the early falls are modest: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 20,629 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,342 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,790 Donald Trump is awake and would like to reassure markets: Wall Street bell goes in 10 minutes... Twitter has reacted with a combination of anger and humour to those Dijsselbloem comments that appear to be critical of the behaviour of Southern European countries. The FTSE 100 is currently down 65 points or 0.9% at 7,314. The FTSE 250 is down 1.1% at 18,788. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, provides this lunchtime summary: A partial reversal of the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump Trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has sent defensives and precious metal producers to the top of the FTSE 100 today, as investors worry that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conflict with Congress will prevent him delivering the pro-business agenda on which he campaigned. Only six FTSE 100 stocks had made it into positive territory at lunchtime, with Randgold topping the list, up 0.8%. Despite recently warning that conditions remain challenging, hopes of an uptick in the global economy helped FTSE 250 shipping group Clarkson enjoy a strong run recently. However, with pro-Trump sentiment wavering it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps unsurprising to see this bellwether of global trade lose some of the wind from its sails, sending the shares down 4.5%. Earlier the Bank of England published its latest agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summary of business conditions. The Bank has 12 regional agents who have discussions with about 700 firms across the UK to glean the latest snapshot of conditions. The survey for the first quarter of 2017 found that growth in retail sales was slowing as the weak pounds feeds through to higher prices and reduces the spending power of consumers. Overall the report was mixed, with exports up and investment intentions picking up. Agents concluded: Moderate rates of activity growth had continued overall. Retail sales volumes growth had eased. It was expected to slow further during the year ahead as the fall in sterling fed through to higher prices, reducing households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power. In contrast, export volume growth had picked up. That was due to the fall in sterling and stronger world growth. Investment intentions had picked up, pointing to modest growth in spending in the year ahead. That reflected continued moderate demand growth and less uncertainty about economic prospects, particularly in the near term. But a lack of visibility of the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading arrangements was weighing on longer-term plans for some contacts. The fall in sterling was being passed through into higher manufacturing output and consumer goods price inflation. Business and consumer services price inflation had edged higher. Over in Brussels, Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - appears to be in a spot of bother. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said Dijsselbloem was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make comments that were interpreted as criticism of southern European countries. Speaking to the German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Dijsselbloem said: In the euro crisis, the northern eurozone states demonstrated solidarity with the countries in crisis. As a Social Democrat, I believe solidarity is extremely important. But whoever demands it also has obligations. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. This principle holds at personal, local, national and even European levels. His comments drew strong criticism in Spain and Italy and the Portuguese prime minister called for Dijsselbloem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. A spokesman for Dijsselbloem defended his comments along the following lines: He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refer to any specific country or group of countries. His message was that solidarity comes with obligations, and the message was for all eurozone countries. Now for some news from Coventry, where the grand opening of the first new car plant in Britain for more than a decade is taking place today. The London Taxi Company (LTC), maker of the famous London black cab, will build electric cabs at the plant, creating more than 1,000 jobs. It is being funded by a \u00c2\u00a3300m investment from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of LTC, plus a \u00c2\u00a316.1m government grant. As well as being a boost for Coventry it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boost for the UK automotive industry, which backed the remain camp in the EU referendum and has voiced concerns that Brexit will lead foreign investment elsewhere. The business secretary Greg Clarke said the new factory, where research and development will also take place, showed that the UK was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world leader in the development of new automotive technologies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Read our full story on the new plant here: Global equities could have quite a bit further to fall according to analysts at Saxo Bank, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-growth policies hit several hurdles along the way. Peter Garnry, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of equity strategy, explains: So much of the narrative has revolved around US president Donald Trump since his election on November 8 but the conviction in the reflation trade faded abruptly in the last US session with the S&amp;P 500 declining more than 1% for the first time since October. So what are we to make of all of this? Where do we go from here? Global equities could easily fall 5-10% in what would be a normal healthy technical correction. And the selloff will be driven by cyclicals: financials, materials, consumer discretionary - a big question mark here is whether technology stocks will hold the line. We see further upside in volatility as markets are now constructing a new narrative that essentially centres on the likelihood that the pro-growth Trump policies or set for a bumpy road with many road blocks . Credit growth has stalled lately and the energy impulse into inflation is gone by June. Gold is benefitting from the widespread equities sell-off and weaker dollar. Spot gold touched a three-week high of $1,248.47 per ounce, and is currently up 0.1% at $1,245. Edward Meir, analyst at INTL FCStone said gold would continue to benefit while investors sold shares: It seems that equity investors decided to take some money of the table, perhaps getting slightly wary about the progress in President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative agenda. Gold will likely continue to rally going into Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session as Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US stock market sell-off was significant and will likely have a knock-on effect on international equity markets over the next 24 hours. Some people are feeling the pinch more than others of course. A report by the Equality Trust found that the average FTSE bosses earns 386 times more than a worker on the national living wage. Taking 2015 annual reports from all FTSE 100 companies, the charity calculated that chief executives were paid \u00c2\u00a35.3m a year, compared with \u00c2\u00a313,662 for someone on the national living wage of \u00c2\u00a37.20 an hour. Here is the full story from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen: Investors are not the only ones feeling pessimistic. UK households are the most downbeat about prospects for their finances since November 2013 according to the Markit Household Finance Index. Families are starting to feel the pinch of rising inflation, as everyday goods get more expensive and wage growth remains weak. It suggests that consumer spending - the main driver of UK growth currently - will start to weaken as households become more cost conscious. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: UK households reported greater pressure on their financial wellbeing in March, as rising inflation has started to erode incomes and reduce cash available to spend. On average in the first quarter of 2017 survey respondents have reported the sharpest increase in their everyday living costs for three-and-a-half years. A combination of rising inflation and subdued pay trends has forced households to recalibrate their expectations for the year ahead. After holding steady last summer, UK consumers are now more downbeat about their financial outlook than at any time since late-2013. Expectations for finances in the next month fell to 45.3 on the index in March, from 48.1 in February, where anything below 50 signals contraction. People living in the East Midlands were the most downbeat about their financial outlook, followed by those in the North East and London. Meanwhile 58% of households expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months. US futures suggest the sell-off on Wall Street is likely to continue when markets open later: Dow Jones futures: -0.3% Nasdaq futures: -0.2% Is this the end of the Trump rally, asks David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co? European stock indices are weaker across the board this morning. Investors are responding to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off on Wall Street which saw the majors close out on their lows. Not only that, but US stock index futures are weaker again this morning. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp reversal took many investors by surprise, particularly as the US session opened with fresh all-time highs for Facebook and the Nasdaq index. Unfortunately for traders, much of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move was down to political factors rather than market technicals. There are fears that the Trump administration won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act when it goes to Congress tomorrow. There are thought to be around 26 Republican representatives who oppose their party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new health care bill. This in turn could jeopardise Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan and this has worried investors who have watched equities soar on the promise of fiscal stimulus. The final scores in Asia: Back in the UK, estate agent Savills has published results. Shares are currently down 1.8%. Julia Kollewe reports: Savills, the upmarket estate agent, has posted annual pretax profits of nearly \u00c2\u00a3100m, up 1%, despite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical distractions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and higher property taxes in the UK and elsewhere. The Brexit vote in June pushed revenues from its UK residential business down 3% to \u00c2\u00a3124m last year. The firm explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A very strong first quarter, as buyers rushed to beat the increased stamp duty on second homes, was followed by low trading volumes in advance of the Brexit referendum at the end of June. Then a relatively quiet, but encouraging summer gave rise to a strong autumn selling season albeit with a slowing of transactions in December.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Savills said the sharp decline in the value of sterling since the referendum had drawn overseas buyers at the top end of the market. The average selling price in London increased slightly to \u00c2\u00a32.9m because the firm sold more properties worth \u00c2\u00a320m or more than in 2015. But it still recorded 5% fewer sales overall, while the market suffered even bigger declines. Outside London there was a 7% increase in exchanges. US bond yields are at three-week lows as investors dump equities in favour of lower-risk assets. The yield on benchmark 10-year US treasuries - an indicator of how much it costs the government to borrow from the financial markets - fell to 2.4%. Kingfisher, the company behind B&amp;Q and Screwfix, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning following the publication of annual results. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Shares in Kingfisher fell 4.8% despite better-than-expected results. The retailer warned of modest price increases and expressed concern that uncertainty around French and British politics could hit demand for its DIY products. Chief executive V\u00c3\u00a9ronique Laury, who is overseeing a five-year revamp of the business, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France, especially in light of the forthcoming presidential elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company beat City forecasts with a 14.7% rise in annual underlying pretax profit to \u00c2\u00a3787m. A good performance in the UK &amp; Ireland, where like-for-like sales rose 5.9%, offset a 2.7% sales drop in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico D\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t. The retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman Daniel Bernard is to step down in June after eight years in the role. He will be succeeded by Andy Cosslett, the former chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group and Fitness First, who previously worked at Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. He also chairs Rugby Football Union. Investors are not happy at all this morning. Losses are widening across Europe on fears that Trump is not going to be able to deliver on his policy pledges. Much of the optimism about his policies to boost US (and therefore global) growth has already been priced into markets since his election, with Wall Street and European markets hitting record highs. But as President Trump deals with the reality of governing, it seems determination alone is not enough to push through his flagship policies. If Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet managed to overhaul Obamacare - his key priority - won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his promises on tax giveaways and infrastructure spending get kicked into the long grass? Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says markets are in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sour mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Based on the mess Republicans are making of their healthcare reforms it seems increasingly unlikely that the Wotsit-in-Chief will be able to deliver on his sweeping tax changes and $1 trillion infrastructure spending. Combine that with the Wall Street Journal, a notably right-leaning publication, claiming that if Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshow more respect for the truth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost Americans may conclude he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and the optimism that caused investors to flock to the major indices has been seriously undermined by, well, Trump himself. The FTSE 100 is down 72 points as the negative sentiment spreads. The mining sector and financials are taking the brunt of it. Current scores on the board: FTSE 100: -1% at 7,306 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.8% at 11,871 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.8% at 4,963 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 19,706 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.9% at 10,126 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 373 The pound is just about holding on to the gains it made against the dollar on Tuesday following the sharp rise in UK inflation to 2.3% in February from 1.8%. In theory, the acceleration of inflation brings forward the prospect of a UK interest rate rise and adds weight to the decision by Kristin Forbes - member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee - to vote for a hike at the March meeting (she was outvoted). The pound is also being supported by dollar weakness, and is currently flat at $1.2477. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1550. European markets have opened lower, as fears ripple across the Atlantic over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push through growth-boosting policies: FTSE 100: -0.6% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.8% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.7% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.9% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.7% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% Nouriel Roubini, the economist who is probably best known for predicting the global financial crisis, has also warned on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Specifically, the professor at NYU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stern School of Business, says markets have over-estimated how many beneficial policies the President can carry through, while underestimating the potential negatives. Roubini told CNBC: [Markets] are overestimating the positives of the US-Trump policies. Infrastructure, stimulus, deregulation, tax cuts: I think Trump will achieve much less on those dimensions. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re underestimating the risk that the US protectionist policies are going to lead to trade wars, that the restrictions on immigration are going to slow down labor supply, and that micromanaging the corporate sector is going to be negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares in Asia are down sharply this morning following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day this year. It appears that hopes are evaporating of swift action on the growth-boosting policies promised by President Trump. With much of the upside already priced in, investors are now coming to the realisation that for all the talk, it might take longer than expected to push through reforms. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: After the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest one day fall since last October last year, the question being asked is whether the scales are starting to fall away from investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes as to whether President Trump will be able to deliver anything close to what has been priced into markets since his election last November. Even the mistiest eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised and as such any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future. Here is how US markets closed: Dow Jones: -1.1% at 20,668 S&amp;P 500: -1.2% at 2,344 Nasdaq: -1.5% at 5,333 And in Asia: Hang Seng: -1.3% at 24,275 Nikkei: -2% at 19,041 Topix: -2% at 1,530 Shares in Europe are expected to open lower this morning: We will be tracking all the key developments.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which passed the 20,000 mark only in January, was approaching 21,000 before Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline that continued into Wednesday. The previous pace couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been sustained for ever. Stock markets rarely run in straight lines, especially when the US Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in three months.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar story in the UK. Just as the Dow remains above 20,000, so the FTSE 100 index closed on Wednesday 300 points above the 7,000 mark, which it last passed around Christmas time. The Trump bump to share prices has merely received a dent, which was to be expected.</p> <p>It would be also be fair to say the mood is nervous. If the president is running into political trouble in his attempt to repeal Obamacare, will there also be delays to his promised infrastructure splurge, the factor that has driven share prices higher? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair question, and the answer will be critical for stock markets in the short-term.</p> <p>Yet the most interesting market movement is happening not in share prices but in oil. The price of a barrel of Brent dipped below $50 on Wednesday, down 11% since the start of the month. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the script when Opec and a few non-Opec countries, including Russia, agreed a deal to curb production at the end of last year.</p> <p>In the event, oil stocks remain high and US production is strong, presenting Opec with a serious headache. If it wants to force the oil price higher, its production cuts may have to be deeper for longer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not obvious that all its members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and especially the non-members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have the political will or financial flexibility.</p> <p>A lower oil price this year would be excellent news, not least for Downing Street and the Bank of England. It would dampen the currency-inspired inflation in other parts of the economy. If cheaper oil is accompanied by a minor stock market wobble, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not so bad.</p> <h2>Off the hook lightly for Thames Water</h2> <p>Pumping huge quantities of untreated sewage into the River Thames is as bad as it gets if, like Thames Water, two of your aims are to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prevent pollution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect and, where possible, improve wildlife and conserve our cultural heritage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

That was the judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But if he thinks a \u00c2\u00a320.3m penalty will impress Thames shareholders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a crew of infrastructure and sovereign wealth funds who have done splendidly over their decade of ownership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he needs to raise his sights.</p> <p>Thames Water Utilities, the debt-laden operating company that sits under various holding companies, <a href=\"https://corporate.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/our-business/financial-information/-/media/be8d44bec98a4417aa6902a6cf0e5a36.ashx?bc=white&amp;db=web&amp;la=en&amp;thn=1&amp;ts=5ad81e41-a159-408c-b51b-c007feef99af.pdf\">incurred net finance expenses of \u00c2\u00a3257m in its last financial year, but still made a \u00c2\u00a3511m profit before tax</a>.

If the president is running into political trouble in his attempt to repeal Obamacare, will there also be delays to his promised infrastructure splurge, the factor that has driven share prices higher? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair question, and the answer will be critical for stock markets in the short-term. Yet the most interesting market movement is happening not in share prices but in oil. The price of a barrel of Brent dipped below $50 on Wednesday, down 11% since the start of the month. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the script when Opec and a few non-Opec countries, including Russia, agreed a deal to curb production at the end of last year. In the event, oil stocks remain high and US production is strong, presenting Opec with a serious headache. If it wants to force the oil price higher, its production cuts may have to be deeper for longer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not obvious that all its members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and especially the non-members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have the political will or financial flexibility. A lower oil price this year would be excellent news, not least for Downing Street and the Bank of England. It would dampen the currency-inspired inflation in other parts of the economy. If cheaper oil is accompanied by a minor stock market wobble, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not so bad. Off the hook lightly for Thames Water Pumping huge quantities of untreated sewage into the River Thames is as bad as it gets if, like Thames Water, two of your aims are to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prevent pollution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect and, where possible, improve wildlife and conserve our cultural heritage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Visible sewage was seen along nine miles of the river in 2012 and 2013, killing birds and fish. The sentencing remarks in a case brought by the Environment Agency (EA) were suitably damning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the judge, Francis Sheridan, at Aylesbury crown court. The EA said it was the biggest freshwater pollution case it had mounted and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a pattern of unprecedented pollution incidents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have been avoided if Thames had been open and frank in its dealings with the agency. Hit the owners where it hurts, then? That was the judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But if he thinks a \u00c2\u00a320.3m penalty will impress Thames shareholders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a crew of infrastructure and sovereign wealth funds who have done splendidly over their decade of ownership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he needs to raise his sights. Thames Water Utilities, the debt-laden operating company that sits under various holding companies, incurred net finance expenses of \u00c2\u00a3257m in its last financial year, but still made a \u00c2\u00a3511m profit before tax. Consider that a sum of \u00c2\u00a320m equates to a single week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment by Thames. Thames Water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Steve Robertson ,cited the investment figure to show the company understands \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our huge responsibilities to the environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It would be equally true to say that, in financial terms, a \u00c2\u00a320m fine will be lost in the wash of raw sewage. Kingfisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey learnings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says V\u00c3\u00a9ronique Laury, the chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix. Never mind Brexit and the French presidential elections. Think of the uncertainty caused to the poor staff and shareholders as they tried to decipher Laury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153key learnings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from her five-year plan. Here is the third learning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have identified the need to approach the wider transformation as a series of sequential \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchange releases\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to ensure appropriate cross visibility and prioritisation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What? Maybe she means Kingfisher is going to do one thing and then do another. If so, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a plan to keep life simple. Why not say so?",

                "bodyText":"Markets on both sides of the Atlantic are trading slightly higher as investors await developments on the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crucial healthcare bill - which may or may not be put to the vote today. Stronger-than-expected data in the UK and the US has managed to keep sentiment broadly positive: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,332 Dow Jones: +0.2% at 20,703 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.7% at 11,984 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.5% at 5,018 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 376 The pound has held on to its gains against the dollar and is currently up 0.3% at $1.2521. Sterling is also up 0.4% against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1604. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thank you for your comments and please join us again tomorrow morning. The short-term lettings industry is attempting to clean-up its reputation with the creation of a new trade body. Airbnb has teamed up with Under The Doormat and various other sites to form the short-term accommodation association (STAA). The industry has been criticised for contributing to the housing crisis by taking properties out of the market. Merilee Karr, chairman of STAA and the founder of Under the Doormat, said the new body intended to create a new industry code: We understand there are concerns but the reality is that short-term lettings offer an opportunity for people to earn an extra source of income from their most important assets. Homeowners and families who have struggled through the financial crisis have the chance to make a little extra money when they are away. We will also set our industry code of conduct to raise the bar for our members and new market entrants to ensure the standards that we have all worked so hard to make are the industry norm. Unite, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest union, has renewed its calls for access to the single market after Brexit. It follows the strong car manufacturing figures for February. Len McCluskey, general secretary, said: These astonishingly good figures clearly demonstrate that the automotive industry is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjewel in the crown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of British manufacturing which the prime minister needs to vigorously fight for in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red line for the car industry is access to the European single market with no tariffs and a frictionless supply chain through membership of the customs union. Unite and the car companies are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in wanting this success story to continue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and protecting and enhancing the dominant role that the automotive industry plays in the British economy should be at the top of the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda when the Brexit talks start. New us home sales rose by 6.1% to 592,000 in February, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since July 2016. The figure for January was also revised up to 558,000 from an earlier estimate of 555,000. New home sales account for almost 10% of overall home sales, and were boosted last month by some unseasonably warm weather. An update on Greece now, where it is hoped record tourism will provide a boost to the crisis-hit economy. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helena Smith reports: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest carrier, Aegean Airlines, has reported a rise in passenger numbers despite a drop in profits. The record numbers visiting Greece were reflected in the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, which showed that passengers grew 7% in 2016 to 12.5 million. Despite the airline posting a 53% drop in net profit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mainly because of higher VAT offsetting a rise in sales - the carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s load factor also increased by 0.6 percentage points to 77.4 percent. An unprecedented 30 million foreign tourists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost three times the entire Greek population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are likely to visit the country this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are expecting an exceptional year for tourism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimitris Tsiodras, spokesman of the centrist Potami party told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hellenic bankers were just telling us that they expect tourism to play a significant role in stabilising the economy. It is the bright light on the horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Syntagma square, overlooking the Greek parliament, kiosk owners were echoing that view this morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the coming weeks the tourist season will begin and we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pavlos Yiannopoulos as he hung newspapers from a rack. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to become the Florida of Europe. After all these years of recession, it is our only hope.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tourism employs one in five Greeks in a nation where the jobless rate among the under 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is over 50 percent. Trading is underway in the US and markets subdued ahead of the crucial vote on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial healthcare bill. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,634 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,345 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,812 As we wait for the Wall Street bell to go, here are the latest scores across Europe: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,314 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 11,917 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.04% at 4,993 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 20,011 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,242 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 375 US markets are expected to open slightly lower: Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has been speaking at a Fed event in Washington, DC. Anyone looking for a steer on the timing of the next interest rate rise will be disappointed, as Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus was on young people and education, and not on monetary policy. She said more needed to be done to prepare young people for success in the jobs markets: Research presented over the next two days makes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to prepare people for success in the labor market. This research underscores the value of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy, and interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skills help prepare people for work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and be in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials that are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Yellen said a better long-term approach would be beneficial to the wider economy: Our young people are the future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and fulfilling lives. As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy when more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances. In short, ensuring that all of our kids have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong foundations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will help build a similarly strong foundation for the U.S. economy. The full speech is available here. New US jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week. The US Labor Department said initial claims were 258,000 in the week ending 18 March, following 243,000 claims a week earlier (revised up from 241,000). Economists had forecast 240,000 claims for the latest week. Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor for monetary policy, has given a speech in London on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He said consumers are already feeling the pinch from the drop in then value of the pound, and the effects are starting be reflected in shops sales: The vote to leave the EU led to a big drop in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate. One consequence is a rise in import prices and a squeeze on households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real income. We may already be seeing the impact of that squeeze on retail spending, which in real terms fell quite sharply around the turn of the year. Exporters on the other hand are enjoying a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he argued, because their goods are cheaper abroad but Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current membership of the EU means they are not yet facing additional tariffs. The result \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher prices and profits but unchanged rules and costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c represents something of a sweet spot for exporters and businesses that compete with imports. The sweet spot is not expected to last, he adds, which could make businesses more cautious about investing. No sign yet of that much feared slowdown in British car manufacturing following the Brexit vote. The number of cars rolling off UK production lines rose 8% in February (compared with a year earlier), to 153,041. It was the strongest February in 17 years, and meant that factories turned out one car every 16 seconds last month according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The vast majority - 78% - were destined for overseas market, with cars built for export up 13.4%. Domestic demand for British-built cars was much weaker, falling 7.4%. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT trade body, used the figures as an opportunity to highlight the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about possible trade tariffs post Brexit: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures illustrate the continuing global popularity of British-built vehicles and the export-led nature of the industry. With eight out of every 10 cars we produce destined for international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and half of those for customers in the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we must avoid barriers to trade, whether tariff, customs or other regulatory obstacles, at all costs. To do otherwise would damage our competitiveness and threaten the continued success of UK automotive manufacturing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Returning to the official retail sales for February, the strong monthly figure masks the underlying weakness revealed by the broader three-month trend. Over the three months, retail sales volumes fell 1.4%, the biggest drop since March 2010. The ONS suggested that higher fuel prices made drivers less willing to fill-up their tanks over the period. The narrowing gap between growth in shop prices and retail sales on a three-month basis, is illustrated here: The pound is just about holding on to one-month highs above $1.25: The CBI has just published its own survey of the retail sector, which is also slightly ahead of expectations. Strength in the retail sector continued into March according to the business lobby group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distributive trades survey. Of the retailers surveyed, 44% said sales volumes were up on a year ago, while 35% said they were down. That gave a balance of +9%, matching February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure but better than the +5% forecast by economists. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all plain sailing however. The CBI said retailers face the twin pressures of having to pay more for goods and materials, and increased competition. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the group, explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see that sales volumes growth is holding up and expectations have strengthened. However, retailers continue to be squeezed by rising cost pressures on the one hand, and intense competition on the other, which will limit their ability to raise prices. With household spending growth set to slow as inflation rises, retailers seem likely to remain under pressure through this year. Read our full story on the bumper retail sales figures for February: The surprisingly sharp rise in retail sales suggests UK consumers were not deterred from spending by higher shop prices in February. But this could change, economists are warning. In the same month, higher food and fuel prices pushed inflation up to 2.3% in February - the highest in almost three-and-a-half years - from 1.8% in January. Prices are expected to rise further still, with inflation forecast to hit about 3% later this year. As price rises accelerate, wage growth is weakening, meaning that household finances are likely to come under increasing strain in the coming months. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, prefers to look at retail sales over the three months to February, which fell 1.4%, rather than the single month. With shoppers facing a combination of still-subdued pay growth and rising inflation, Q1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely weak performance may be a harbinger for 2017 as a whole. Annual shop price inflation increased to 2.8% from 1.9% in January, a 60-month high. How the year pans out will depend heavily upon consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to draw on savings or take on more debt. While these sources may deliver some mitigation to squeezed spending power, last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail boom looks set to become an increasingly distant memory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank: UK retail sales showed the first upwards surprise for 3 months. Will it last? With inflation getting higher and higher, the fundamentals would suggest not - i.e. the squeeze on disposable income is intensifying. The downward glide path should resume in the coming months. Here is how Asian markets ended the day, courtesy of traders at spread-betting firm IG: The stronger-than-expected retail sales have helped to push the pound higher against the dollar and the euro. Sterling is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2510 and up 0.5% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1612. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at OFX, said a combination of factors were helping to drive the pound higher and could push it further still: Retail sales data was very strong this morning and sterling has rallied once again. It comes hot off the back of the headline inflation earlier in the week, with the hawkish MPC statement and rate vote results still resonating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to make for an even more aggressive BoE statement next month, with sterling up through 1.25 as a result. This recent combination of market data will likely support the pound through to the end of the week and perhaps into next. 1.26 could well be in sight. Figures just out show stronger than expected retail sales in February. Sales jumped 1.4%, signalling consumer resilience despite rising inflation and weak wage growth. Economists had forecast far weaker growth of 0.4%. The January figure was revised down to show a 0.5% drop in sales, bigger than the 0.3% drop initially estimated. A strong performance in February pushed the annual rate of growth to 3.7% from 1% in January. However, the Office for National Statistics cautioned the broader quarterly picture was less rosy. Retail sales over the three months to February fell by 1.4% form the second month in a row - the largest fall since March 2010 and only the second fall since December 2013. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said: February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January. The monthly growth in February is seen across all store types. The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months. Over in France, optimism among firms in the industrial sector fell to a four-month low in March, in a possible sign that uncertainty surrounding the presidential election is starting to weigh on confidence. The business climate index for the industrial sector, published by Insee, fell to 104 points in March from 107 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to stay at 107. European markets are in a subdued mood this morning as investors await the crucial US vote on the healthcare bill which seeks to overturn Obamacare. With many opposed to the bill in its current form, investors are concerned that should Trump lose the vote, his growth-boosting policy promises might not materialse. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex: The markets got off to an understandably quiet start this Thursday, the European indices gently slipping into the red after the bell. There are a couple of reasons why investors may be sitting on their hands this morning. Firstly, the tragedy in Westminster on Wednesday is the kind of event that casts the cold light of perspective on the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frivolities. Secondly, investors are waiting for the House of Representatives vote on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrumpcare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 later in the day; if the President can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the bill passed it would suggest he faces an uphill battle push through his tax and infrastructure reforms. And considering it was those promises that sent the Dow Jones et al. sky high, investors will likely not react well to that eventuality. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says that investors knew what was coming from the retailer in the form of the first profit drop in eight years. Not a pretty set of figures from Next but no worse than expected after warning on profits in January. Following that dire Christmas trading update investors were prepared for this and the retailer remains extremely cautious about the year ahead. It was the first drop in annual profits in 8 years but investors seem to be reassured that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking steps to turn things around with a focus on core products. Next has to get its house in order and focus more on its core product \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something it says it began doing in January. UK retail sales have held up in the months following the Brexit vote (led by clothing retail sales hit a 14-year peak in October) but Next has suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly not been getting things right. The question is whether a return to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be enough to offset the external headwinds. Fundamentally the business remains strongly cash generative even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not expanding rapidly and is able to maintain solid returns to investors. Shares have already halved in value since the 2015 peak. With the Directory division performing very well it appears well placed to respond to consumer trends as they shift more spend online. Next is at the top of the FTSE 100 leader board this morning, despite reporting its first annual profits fall in eight years. Shares in the clothing and homeware retailer are up 6% at \u00c2\u00a341.05 after it said pre-tax profit fell 5.5% to \u00c2\u00a3790.2m last year. It was in line with City expectations, so investors were relieved there were no nasty surprises in the numbers. Chief executive Lord Wolfson said the year ahead was also looking challenging: The year ahead looks like it will be tough with a combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us. Next also signalled a shift in emphasis in its clothing ranges, suggesting it had neglected simpler, popular ranges, in favour of more fashionable lines. In focussing so much energy on changing our buying culture, processes and adopting exciting new trends, we have omitted some of our best-selling, heartland product from our ranges. These are the easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours. Corrective action is relatively straightforward and began in late January. We believe that some of these changes will begin to be reflected in our Summer ranges from May onwards, but we will not have our ranges where we want them until the Autumn season. Trading is Europe is underway and investors are in following Asia and Wall Street by taking a bit of a breather. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points or 0.2% at 7,312. Elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 11,914 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: flat at 4,995 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,985 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,242 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 374 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets are subdued after Wall Street stabilised on Wednesday. Fears that President Trump will not be able to deliver on his growth boosting policy pledges have not gone away, but investors appear to be taking a breather before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial vote on the Republican healthcare bill in the US. The bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare and has been a key priority for Trump from the outset, is a major test for the President. A failure to win the vote will ring alarm bells on Wall Street and beyond that Trump will not be able to deliver other policy pledges, such as tax giveaways and infrastructure spending. In Asia, the Hang Seng was down 0.2% at 24,278, while the Nikkei rose 0.2% to 19,085. Here is how Wall Street closed on Wednesday: Also today, we have official UK retail sales for February at 9.30am, giving an insight into how resilient consumers are feeling in the face of rising inflation and weak wage growth. The CBI will give its take on the retail sector in its latest distributive survey at 11am. And in the US, Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, will give a speech. We will be tracking all the key developments through the day.",

First, the Trump administration doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a detailed tax plan of its own and frankly, at this stage, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questionable whether it has the expertise to craft its own bill.

                "bodyText":"Financial experts are split over whether Trump can move past the healthcare headache and deliver tax reforms. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is still cautiously optimistic that the Trump White House will be able to push through many of their pro-business policies, and I think a lot of people are hopeful the Trump rally can continue through at least the middle of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Weston of IG also reckons the markets could keep rallying, despite political worries: It is a stretch to believe anyone has really bought into the idea that the Trump administration can really deliver on far-reaching tax reform. But what we can see, is that to a large extent it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to worry them too much either. This is a Teflon market where literally nothing sticks. This seems unfortunate, as volatility provides opportunity. But Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York, is more cautious, arguing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent hiccup on the policy front casts serious doubt on the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push forward its ambitious policy agenda.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrapping up for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Adam Gaffney, instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School, has welcomed the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to push through their replacement for Obamacare. He writes: First, it is tantamount to a societal rejection of the conservative healthcare ethos. Second, it may very well open the door to more progressive, fundamental healthcare change in the years to come. Would-be Trumpcare had three main pillars: continue the Affordable Care Act\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (ACA) subsidization of private health plans (though recalibrated along highly regressive lines), shrink Medicaid by about 25% over a decade, and provide lavish tax breaks to the rich. It was thus the evil cousin of Obamacare: it would have benefited the well-off at the expense of the working class and sick, it is true, yet it would also have conserved Obamacare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall organization, and left many of its insurance regulations intact. This last fact played a major role in the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate, for it alienated hard-right true believers in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House Freedom Caucus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Conservatives contended that it would only be by eliminating Obamacare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various insurance regulations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the one that requires that plans cover \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essential health benefits\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 like hospitalizations, maternity care and medicines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that premiums would fall. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his full take on the now-scuppered American Health Care Act. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses have pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest close since Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, on 14th February. So, its lowest point in almost six week - but still much higher than before last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, and the start of the Trump Bounce. Why did Wall Street claw its way back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows? One theory is that investors are deducing that Donald Trump will now push on with tax reforms. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tax legislation done right and done quickly is a big stimulant to earnings and the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that tax legislation will come much quicker than it would have if the healthcare legislation passed is positive, and I think people are grasping onto that as a reason to hang on and buy more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, believes investors are trying to work out the full implications of the healthcare situation. She says (via CNBC): This is coming as investors reassess how bad the news on health care actually is. There are definitely mixed views on that. This could be a catalyst for Republicans to do a better job with tax reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial stocks ended the day down, as did industrial and energy firms. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the Trump trade (betting on faster growth and higher inflation) has faded today. Technology, healthcare and consumer goods makers dominated the risers: Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen for the eighth day running, its worst losing streak since 2011. But.... it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more muted selloff than earlier today, as traders digest the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloody nose over healthcare reform, and its implications for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. The Dow has closed down 46 points, or 0.22%, at 20,550 points. The S&amp;P 500 lost around 0.1% The Nasdaq gained around 0.2% The dollar has also come back a little, but has still lost much of its gains since November. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of photos from Wall Street today: After a rough start, the US stock market is staging a little recovery in late trading. The S&amp;P 500 index (a broader measure of the markets than the Dow) has now erased its losses, having been down almost 1% in morning trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all doom and gloom in the markets. Jasper Lawler, analyst at London Capital Group, suggests that the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to replace Obamacare could spur the president on: The negative reaction to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare setback makes sense but there could be some silver-linings to be gleamed once the dust settles. Trump the dealmaker President will want a success to offset this failure. With its wings clipped from failed healthcare reform, the White House may pursue tax reform that is more likely to survive the rigor of Congress. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff wiped almost \u00c2\u00a311bn off the companies who make up the FTSE 100 index. That sounds like a lot. After all.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking real money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not much in market terms, and still leaves the FTSE 100 worth around \u00c2\u00a396bn more than on November 9th. Charles Gasparino of Fox News points out that the market rally began to fade after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first State Of The Nation address on February 28th. Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have made the dollar great again - the US currency is now a little weaker than on November 8th. Capital Economics have put out an interesting research note, arguing that the debacle over healthcare reform needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scupper a tax reform plan. But only if - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Big If - Donald Trump can build a consensus within Congress for his plans. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, says: The health care bill fiasco doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily alter our view on the prospect for tax cuts. We had already pushed back our forecast of both the potential size of any fiscal stimulus and its timing, so the latest bout of Republican infighting hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed our thinking that we will eventually see a modest $2trn package of tax cuts enacted by early next year. Even complete legislative gridlock wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily be a disaster, however, particularly not when there is evidence of a very strong pick-up in global economic growth. Ashworth points out that George W Bush managed to get his tax reform plan through the House and the Senate - with 10 Democrats jumping the fence to support him. However.... The contrasts between 2001 and now are stark. First, the Trump administration doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a detailed tax plan of its own and frankly, at this stage, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questionable whether it has the expertise to craft its own bill. As with health care, it is more likely that the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role will be restricted to piggybacking on a plan proposed by the leadership in either the House or the Senate.... Second, there is almost no chance of any Democrats breaking ranks and supporting a bipartisan tax reform bill this year. It simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make electoral sense for them to hand Trump any sort of win, not with the 2018 mid-terms now on the horizon. Despite a late recovery, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have ended the day in the red. Worries over the US political situation weighed on shares, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a dip than a full-blown correction. In London, the FTSE 100 has finished down 43 points at 7293 points, down 0.6%. Mining stocks were the biggest fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta losing 4.6% and iron ore-to-coal trader Glencore down 4.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreflation trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, driven by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises of tax cuts and more spending, is fading. Across the channel, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC ended the day almost flat. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed 0.6%, and the Amsterdam AEX closed down 0.4%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market is also coming back from its lows, but still on track for its worst run of losses since 2011..... Connor Campbell of SpreadEx has spotted that the Dax hit a six-week low earlier today, its lowest point since 14th February, when traders were snapping up red roses and chocolates. Dropping around 170 points after the bell the Dow is now trading at its lowest price since Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 love affair with the belligerent blowhard who currently sits in the White House seemingly at an end. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the markets have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccaught a cold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to win enough support for their healthcare reforms - despite enjoying a majority on Capitol Hill. Having overseen a strong rally in stock markets over the past few months the new US president is learning a hard lesson in the differences between campaign promises and the ability to deliver them in a difficult political environment. President Trump is learning the hard way that there are big differences in promising the earth and then being able to deliver it. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either. This is no better reflected in the decline in the US dollar, as well as bond yields as markets start to price out the imminent prospect of a large scale fiscal stimulus plan. Gold has now recovered almost all its losses since November, as traders dash back into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven assets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The dollar has now fallen to its lowest level since mid-November, when measured against a basket of leading currencies. In other words, nearly all the gains since Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election triumph have now been wiped out. Banks are leading the fallers on Wall Street, with nearly every share on the Dow Jones in the red. Goldman Sachs is leading the decline, down 3%, followed by other financial stocks including JP Morgan, American Express and Visa. Ding ding goes the Wall Street opening bell.....and down goes the stocks! The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 168 points, or 0.8%, to 20,428 points - putting it on track for its eighth decline in a row. The S&amp;P 500 has suffered a similar decline, and the technology-focused Nasdaq has lost 1%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for anyone who has been following the Trump Trade; betting on a strong dollar, buying shares and selling government bonds. As in Europe, US traders are showing anxiety over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get legislation through, following the failure to get the Affordable Health Care Act voted through on Friday. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the failure of the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health reform bill is driving a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flight to safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (and out of stocks) today. While the bill itself was to have a pretty minor effect on equity prices, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure has spooked markets. There are now doubts about whether he can get the much more market-sensitive tax and spend legislation through (whatever that is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it will look like). All this casts a pall over the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get any meaningful reform on the move. Same old Washington gridlock, you might say. No pressure.... Lena Komileva of G+ Economics makes an important point -- European financial assets are looking more attractive, as investors fret about the Trump presidency. She writes: It is clear that market risk premia are no longer coloured by relative monetary policy alone, but also by a new regime of international political risk dominance. The contrast between market expectations of an EU-friendly outcome at the upcoming French elections, after Chancellor Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU better-than-expected polling at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local elections at the weekend, versus President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed healthcare vote in Congress and increased US military engagement in Syria, has resulted in markets demanding a higher \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd premium in US assets (stocks, bond yields and the dollar) versus Europe, notwithstanding the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, inflation and policy rate differential. A new four-month high for the euro! Unless spirits pick up in New York, the market could record its longest losing streak in over five years. The Dow Jones industrial average has already fallen for seven days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running -- an eighth loss would be the worst run since longest losing streak since 2011. Oof! The US dollar has just hit a four-month low against the Japanese yen, at \u00c2\u00a5110.09. With one hour to go until the open, Wall Street is still heading for fresh losses as the Trump trade (buy shares and the US dollar, and sell bonds) unwinds. As this chart shows, the UK and German markets are also in the red: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative headaches, and signs that the European economy is picking up, have swept the euro to its highest level in four and a half months. The euro just hit $1.0879, a gain of 0.8%, and the highest since the week of the US election. It came after European Central Bank board member Sabine Lautenschl\u00c3\u00a4ger said the markets should get ready for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in ECB policy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being taken as a hint that the ECB could soon slow its quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme. Lautenschl\u00c3\u00a4ger was speaking at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual press conference on banking supervision, alongside Dani\u00c3\u00a8le Nouy, who chairs its supervisory board. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have been on quite a rally since Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the White House. The Dow Jones, for example, surged by 15% between November and the start of March. But...it has been dropping back in the last few weeks as investors watched the new president wrestle with the levers of power. Yesterday, The Observer argued there are three reasons why the Trump rally is fading: The first is that it may be some time before Trump gets agreement for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It could easily be delayed until 2018. The second is that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitions may well have to be scaled down. Trump wants to use the savings from replacing Obamacare with something cheaper to fund his fiscal boost, but the Congressional Budget Office said last week that the impact on the budget deficit would be substantially less than originally estimated: a reduction of $150bn (\u00c2\u00a3120bn), rather than $336bn. Fiscal conservatives in Congress will probably demand that Trump finds savings elsewhere. Finally, corporate profits are set to be squeezed by a combination of rising wages, higher interest rates and a stronger dollar. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal package \u00e2\u20ac\u201c assuming it is approved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would reinforce those pressures, because stronger growth would lead to greater demand for labour. Sterling has now hit its highest level since 2nd February, as the US healthcare reform debacle continues to drive the markets. One pound is now worth $1.2590, as investors back the UK currency despite the imminent triggering of Article 50 (inked in for Wednesday). Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says investors haev renewed doubts over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get changes through Capitol Hill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The setback with the healthcare bill was not just the failure by the Republicans to vote for the repeal of Obamacare, but the fact that Trump has failed to get a measure even though the Republicans control the House and the Senate, raising some doubts about his capacity to get his programmes passed into law. Markets had assumed that a radical economic agenda could be passed considering the political dominance of the Republicans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere in the markets, South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rand has taken a sudden hit following reports that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief has been recalled from a foreign trip. Prime minister Jacob Zuma ordered finance minister Pravin Gordhan back from an investor roadshow earlier today, newswires say, sparking speculation that a cabinet reshuffle is imminent. One government source told Reuters that Gordhan didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have permission for the trip, to drum up international interest in buying South African debt. But other reports suggest that Gordhan did have a permission slip, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been revoked... Either way, it means the rand (ZAR) is having an even worse day than the US dollar: Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when the market opens in four hours time. The futures markets indicates that the Dow Jones industrial average could shed over 0.6%, or 140 points, at the open: World stock markets could keep falling in the weeks ahead, if Donald Trump fails to deliver on his ambitious promises to boost government spending and cut taxes. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the healthcare bill was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor litmus test\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Trump. So, Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to get enough support for the legislation suggests Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aggressive policy agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd may struggle. Brooks says: Not only does the failed healthcare bill highlight the challenges Trump may face trying to get his other policies passed, but the Congressional Budget Office also highlighted that the savings expected from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare bill would be much less than expected, which could limit the size and scope of his infrastructure spending plan. This is significant for the markets, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trumpflation\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 trade was based on fiscal spending, if there is less money in the pot, then stocks might have to unwind some of their gains since Trump won the election last November. If that happens, then banks and healthcare providers could be hit particularly hard... The Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointment trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is now in full swing. The biggest losers on the Dow Jones last week were Goldman Sachs, Du Pont, Pfizer and Boeing, all companies that were reliant on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy agenda. We expect losses from banking stocks, materials and construction firms, and healthcare companies in the next few days as the markets adjust to this set back for Trump. How he reacts will be crucial, so we will watch his Twitter account with a close eye. A spat with Congress is likely to keep the markets on edge, weigh on stock markets globally and push up volatility. Just in: German business morale has hit its highest level since July 2011 - defying the market gloom this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey from the IFO thinktank. Its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness climate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey has smashed forecasts, jumping to 112.3 this month, from 111.1 in February. Manufacturing, retailing and construction firms all reported that conditions were better than a month ago, suggesting worries of protectionism and trade wars are receding. Money is pouring out of shares and into safe-haven government bonds. That is driving down the yield (or interest rates) on sovereign debt, as investors accept a lower rate of return in exchange for safety. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Failure to pass the Healthcare Bill doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire agenda is in tatters but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge setback all the same and the market mood reflects as much. Bond yields, the dollar, commodity prices and equities are all weaker. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has a good take on the market selloff this morning, and why traders are suddenly more worried about Donald Trump: We often hear the term, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the good, the bad, and the ugly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the markets are only receiving two of those choices today and neither one is good, as investors swallow the bad pill that is Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed health care plan. In other words, it is a perfect textbook trade where if the result is not in accordance with the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations, the markets will drop like a rock. Donald Trump faced yet another setback on Friday when he pulled the healthcare bill from the House, as it was pretty much established that Obamacare is still more popular than any of his proposed plans. The reason for the panic which is triggering market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, which is actually across the board, is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intensity, especially in those sectors which we mentioned a few ago in our special report. Investors are anxious to see if the big infrastructure and tax reform bills will have any shot of making it in the House and if Congress is going to give them their blessing rather than tough time. It is this in particular which is prompting the panic in the market and has everyone running for the hills. The drop in the US dollar has helped to drive the gold price to a one-month high this morning. Bullion has hit $1.257 per ounce for the first time since 27 February. Jiang Shu, chief analyst at Shandong Gold Group, explains (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looks like some people are not happy with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure over his promises and we see that currently there is a very bearish mood about the U.S. dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A wave of early selling has pushed all the main European stock markets into the red this morning: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the 11th hour withdrawal of the US Healthcare bill on Friday night is putting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four-month global Trump trade rally into question\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Splat. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index of leading shares has fallen by almost 1% at the start of trading. The Footsie has shed 64 points at the open, or 0.9%, to hit 7272 - its lowest point in almost a month. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed says traders are reacting to the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fumbled attempt to replace Obamacare. The lesson learned last week is that a Congress controlled by the Republicans doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean the President will be able to pass laws or his negotiation may work in business deals. Unfortunately for him, it seems politics is going to be a different type of game that requires a different form of art. The pound has hit a one-month high against the US dollar this morning. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare woes are dominating traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention this morning, letting them take their minds off Brexit. Sterling has gained 0.6% to $1.255, its highest level since late February. The dollar is also losing ground against other currencies, as the greenback is undermined by the stunning news that Republicans couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find enough support for their own healthcare bill. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are starting the new week on the back foot, after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to shake up America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare system faltered. Investors across the globe are disconcerted by the Republican party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to get enough support for its proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. A crucial vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was dramatically postpone on Friday night, after it became clear that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough support from Republicans. That has left Trump lashing out at his own side, as well as Democrats, and forced financial traders to reconsider the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to force through other policies -- such as his pledge of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Markets are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rattled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the thought that Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the political capital for a deficit-funded tax cuts, says Ben Gutteridge, head of fund research at Brewin Dolphin, on Bloomberg TV a moment ago. Shares have already suffered in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has fallen by 1.5% and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Sent has lost 0.75%. Safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, and precious metals, are in demand, as the US dollar takes a hit. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump Trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- bets on a strong US economic recovery and higher inflation -- are under pressure. And European and US stock markets are expected to follow suit today, adding to last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff (when the wheels started to come off AHCA). Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on the German economy at 9am, when the latest IFO business confidence survey is released. The European Central Bank is holding its annual press conference on banking supervision In the UK, telecoms group BT has just been fined \u00c2\u00a342m for failing to give its rivals fair access to its network, and for not fairly compensating them for delays:",

Economist Jonathan Loynes said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence.</p> <p>Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further.</p> <p>If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy.</p> <p>And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn.</p> <p>For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7636e4b01ea2330bce59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:43:38.329Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound [fell] by 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro after having been in the green before the bell rang on Wall Street. This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime.</p> <p>It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7350e4b01ea2330bce47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:34:34.714Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000.</strong></p> <p>The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably.

                "bodyText":"Breaking! The Dow Jones industrial average has ended its eight-day long run of losses, and avoided its worst losing streak in almost 40 years. The benchmark index has closed up around 0.75%, as Wall Street regained its poise after some nervous sessions. Traders cited the surge in consumer confidence to a 16-year high today, and hopes that Donald Trump will manage to get his tax reforms (tax cuts, more likely) through Congress. Tom Porcelli of RBC Capital Markets says: One of the most fundamental drivers of the backdrop is employment. What we just got from the Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence report should embolden those that believe continued labor market tightening (and accelerating wage growth) is in the offing. Financial stocks, and consumer goods makers, led the rally. The top performer on the Dow was Apple, which closed at a new alltime high of $143.92 per share. And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrapping up. Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting. GW With just 10 minutes to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is on track to break its losing streak. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 160 points, or almost 0.8%, at 20,712 points. Surely nothing can shake the rally?.... Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York, believes improved economic data (such as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence figures) are helping share prices today. He says (via Reuters): This market is driven by two things - the hope of policy agenda getting put into place and improving fundamentals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest coin, and the challenges we faced when trying to use it... Wall Street might avoid racking up its worst run of losses since 1978. The main indices are all in green right now, meaning the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to avoid its ninth fall in a row. Investors are cheered by the news that US consumer confidence has hit a 16-year high today. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also still pondering Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get his legislative agenda through Congress.... Back in South Africa, the rand remains under pressure as investors continue to fret that finance minister Pravin Gordhan could be replaced soon. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no official word about Gordhan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, since he was told to cut short his trip to meet European and US investors and return home this morning. And this lack of clarity means the rand is down 1.65% today at 12.95 to the US dollar. A weaker pound ahead of the triggering of Article 50 on Wednesday boosted the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners who benefit from any slip in sterling. Positive results from building materials group Wolseley also helped matters, as did an early rise on Wall Street after eight days of decline. Meanwhile European markets were also recovering, while oil prices moved higher after problems with supplies in Libya. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.68% or 49.92 points at 7343.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.28% to 12,149.42 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.57% higher at 5046.20 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 1.02% to 20,330.42 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.84% at 10,389.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 664.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.44%. The pound has slipped back further following McCafferty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and is now down 0.46% at $1.2497. Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist says: There may also be some effect from the vote in the Scottish Parliament to call for a second independence referendum. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, is on radio station LBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone in at the moment. My colleague Katie Allen is following the broadcast: A cry of excitement went up at Chapel market as a new pound coin was used to pay for eight tangerines. But John, who has run the neighbouring picture framing stall for more than twenty years, said he was disappointed by its appearance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks like a token, not a proper coin. it seems unfair to me that businesses such as Arcade owners etc are having to pay for the costs of converting machines. That should be a cost that the Government covers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Islington the vast majority of parking meters have been converted to payment by mobile phone only. HSBC at Baker Street was one of several bank branches we popped into to question availability, and where staff said they did not expect to receive the new coin until Friday at the earliest. Even cabbies are up in arms over the changes. Black cab driver Ivan Sobell from Barnet, North London, accepted a new one one as payment, only to find out that it is slightly too big to fit into his coin tube, where he stashes up to fifteen coins at a time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to invest in a smartie tube\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he joked, saying it was the first - and likely to be the last - he had received in a fare today. Coin-operated launderettes - a dying species these days - are also likely to disappoint users holding only the new coins. At the Barbican launderette, a bank of giant washer dryers still take only the old coins, for 19 minutes drying time. Back with our test drive of the new pound coin: At Chapel market in Islington, north London, a busy shopping centre where major supermarkets fringe an old-fashioned fruit and vegetable market, no shoppers had yet seen the new coin and there was no information from retailers informing them of it. A hundred-odd trolleys linked together and locked outside the large Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdual slots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 designed to accommodate the old pound coin and the one euro coin. The new twelve-sided coin fits into the slot that accommodates the euro so there has been no need to upgrade the trolleys. Thanks to the helpful member of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff who came outside to show me and explain to other shoppers. The same dual slot is also in use in frozen food store Iceland. Waitrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trolleys had no locks at all, and the nearby Marks &amp; Spencer had only plastic trolley-style baskets with extendable handles, which are not lockable. But at the nearby Tesco Metro on Islington Green, the trolleys in use had old-style locks which take only the old-style pound and not the new one. Shoppers said they would have to remember to always have an old coin in a handy place. Tesco has promised that it will unlock all trolleys that are not compatible with the new coin, but this store has obviously slipped through the net. Capital Economics suggests that the triggering of Article 50 - finally - could actually give some support to the pound. Economist Jonathan Loynes said: While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence. Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further. If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy. And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn. For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound [fell] by 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro after having been in the green before the bell rang on Wall Street. This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime. It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway. US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000. The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying: Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably. Consumers also expressed much greater optimism regarding the short-term outlook for business, jobs and personal income prospects. Thus, consumers feel current economic conditions have improved over the recent period, and their renewed optimism suggests the possibility of some upside to the prospects for economic growth in the coming months. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The incredible hike in consumer confidence will be a huge boost to US business, with the figures jumping to an unexpected 16-year high. Over in the US, and it looks like being touch and go whether the Dow Jones racks up its longest losing streak for nearly 40 years. After an opening fall, the Dow is now up 25 points although there is a long way yet to go. After the Trump rally following the US election result in November and the expectation that the new president would boost the economy with tax reforms and infrastructure spending the doubts have set in. The failure of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare bill has investors wondering whether he will be able to pass any of his other proposals and the uncertainty is taking the shine off the market, as well as weakening the dollar. But last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery from its worst levels seems to be giving the US market some support at the moment. The new \u00c2\u00a31 coin has passed its last test...it works in the luggage trolleys outside Kings Cross station. The parking meters in Lincoln\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inn Fields near the High Court in London also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the new pound coin. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better news at Holborn underground station; the new coin works in the ticket machines, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve topped up an Oyster card. Car drivers who try to park in Liverpool today will struggle to use the new \u00c2\u00a31, judging by this photo: All you need to know about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a31 coin, in just one minute: Eva Karras-Balint, receptionist at the London School of Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Old Building, likes the look of the new pound coin. She tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gorgeous. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely an improvement. It looks a bit like the \u00c2\u00a32 coin and I like the way it looks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, things take a disappointing turn when we try to spend our \u00c2\u00a31 on a well-earned hot chocolate. The new quid does not work in a hot drinks vending machine at the London School of Economics. It falls straight through. Chris Whittall of the Wall Street Journal reckons the Dow could rack up its longest losing run in almost 40 years today, if it closes in the red again. Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in around 50 hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, as investors continue to digest Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure on healthcare reform. After eight falls in a row, the Dow is tipped to shed a few more points at the open. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says traders are still edgy. Today, US index futures are currently pointing to a slightly weaker open, with European markets struggling to hold onto their earlier gains. So, there seems to be some stability in the markets at the time of this writing. But the lack of any major news or other fundamental events, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little or no reason for the on-going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood to turn decisively positive. Thus, equities could fall back later on today or this week, even if technically the markets look more stable. Put another way, safe haven assets like gold and Japanese yen may remain underpinned. More \u00c2\u00a31 teething problems... You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to make a phone call from a phone booth with the new pound coin - it came straight back out. Slightly embarrassingly, the new \u00c2\u00a31 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on machines at the nearest pub to the Royal Mint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Llantrisant, near Cardiff. According to Wales News, workers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to use the 12-sided coin in the pool table of The Three Saints, or the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy machine either! Wales News reports: More than 300 million of the shiny new coins made at the Royal Mint at it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-security Welsh base were released today. But many vending machines have not been adapted in time - including the Three Saints less than 200 yards from the entrance to the Mint. The fruit machine was altered just in time but the pool table and the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy vending machine is still old-school coins. Hotel worker Jade Davies said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some workers came in last week to work on the fruit machine. They came in especially to alter it so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready for the new \u00c2\u00a31 coin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy machine won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the new coins just yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd South Eastern trains is rather belatedly going to put up signs on cash ticket machines this afternoon to alert customers to the introduction of the new coin. Cashiers in the ticket office in London Bridge had not seen any of the new coins yet (at least until The Guardian turned up with a handful). A customer in her 60s was intrigued and came over to look at the new coin. Pointing to her grey hair, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m old enough to remember the old threepenny bit. it looks a bit like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tracked down Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shiny new \u00c2\u00a31 coin, but found a few problems when we actually tried to spend one of them.... Julia Kollewe explains: We just tried to buy a \u00c2\u00a33 ticket to London Bridge from Charing Cross but the new pound coin got stuck in the ticket machine (at least we got it back). Disappointing! But fortunately this tale has a happy ending... When we tried a different ticket machine we managed to buy the ticket with three brand new coins. Hooray! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not looking very good for South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister.... South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has landed back in the country, having been hauled back from his investor roadtrip by prime minister Zuma. Pravin Gordhan didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too rattled when he met with reporters, saying; The president is my boss so if he asks us to come back, we come back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are many in government who want to do the right thing and make sure we keep our economy on track and keep our development moving in the right direction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rand is still under pressure, though, thanks to those rumours that Gordhan could be sacked today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 1.5% at 12.935 to the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an exciting day for numismatic lovers, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a31 coin goes into circulation. Billed as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most secure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coin of its type in the world, it is thinner, lighter and slightly bigger than the old quid. It also has 12 sides -- which is likely to cause problems with any vending machines that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been updated. The new \u00c2\u00a31 coins also have a snazzy feature - a hologram-like image that changes from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00c2\u00a3\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd symbol to the number \u00e2\u20ac\u01531\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when viewed from different angle. However..The newly minted \u00c2\u00a31 coins are hard to get. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports that: Only certain bank branches had received them by this morning. At Santander in Triton Square, London, only customers of the bank can withdraw the new coins from their account, up to \u00c2\u00a320. So if you find one today, at least you can watch it here: The problems that have dogged Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse in Derbyshire have not been fully addressed, MPs have heard this morning. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee that Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail group have tackled some issues..but many others remain resolved. Turner explains to the committee that: 1) Sports Direct had refused to employ all its agency staff who make up the bulk of its workforce, as the union has pushed for. It is currently moving 10 workers per month onto its books, which means it would take 27 years to complete the job. 2) Those agency staff are still on contracts that only guarantee 366 hours per year, so a full-time worker will have used them up by the end of February. 3) There has been no progress on agreeing collective bargaining for workers at the Shirebrook site. More positively, Turner confirmed that the notorious \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsix strikes and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy enforced by employment agencies has been axed, and Sports Direct has taken its own staff off zero hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contracts. Where an issue has been in the public gaze, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken action, Turner concluded. But where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not, or where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not their responsibility, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not taken action. You can watch the hearing here. Despite Wolseley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, the Footsie has now dipped into the red. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons that traders are getting a touch of Brexit nerves, with Theresa May planning to trigger Article 50 on Wednesday. Beauchamp says: The recovery in US markets last night and a relatively positive session in Asia is not translating into gains for the FTSE 100 this morning, and the nearness of the Article 50 activation is undoubtedly contributing to the air of nervousness. A lack of newsflow continues to bedevil this market, but the rebound off the lows for Wall Street indicates that there is still plenty of buying pressure out there. Other European markets are still up though: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is being supported by Wolseley, the plumping and building chain. Its shares have jumped by over 6% today to a five-year high, after it cheered the City by posting a 25% rise in profits. The recovery was driven by Wolseley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business in North America, called Ferguson, which made up for tougher trading conditions in the UK and the Nordic regions. The firm also announced that it plans to rename itself Ferguson - good news for any of us who struggle to either spell or pronounce Wolseley (I normally plump for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wool-zee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Asian markets have posted solid gains today as investors moved on from worrying about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare setback. The Australian index jumped by 1.5%, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei rose by 1.1%, and there were gains in Hong Kong too. Traders weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too disconcerted by the US Dow racking up its eighth daily fall on Monday. Although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst run since 2011, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the actual decline is quite modest - at just 1.7%. Hardly a Trump Slump (yet, anyway). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump slump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 narrative is an ugly piece of hyperbole. As but one example, the seven consecutive day fall in the Dow Industrials in the week to Friday amounted to a cumulative -1.69%, which is the third smallest 7-day setback in the history of the index. The head of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chambers of Commerce has claimed this morning that Brexit will have serious impact on trade with the UK. Eric Schweitzer warned that four in 10 German companies expect business with Britain to weaken, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should expect further declines in trade in the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, it all depends what kind of deal the UK and the rest of Europe can agree. London mayor Sadiq Khan has just called for an agreement that offers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued fortune and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to both sides. More here: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains why shares are recovering from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wobble: Bond and FX market participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to the failure of the healthcare bill has been to re-price Treasuries and the Dollar under the assumption that President Trump has lost a little of his shine. Equity market participants have taken a look at the lower yields and weaker dollar and decided that since absurdly low rates are the elixir that the equity bull market lives on, they might as well \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the dip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yet again. Meanwhile in the UK, supermarket chain Tesco will pay a \u00c2\u00a3129m fine after coming to a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office over its 2014 accounting scandal. Tesco will also pay \u00c2\u00a385m of compensation to investors who bought shares and bonds in summer 2014, shortly before the false accounting came to light. More here: Separately, two top Tesco shareholders have gone public with their concerns over its proposed takeover of wholesale food producer Booker. They fear that Tesco is paying too much, and might derail its own turnaround plan/. Shares in Booker are down 2% this morning. European stock markets have shaken off Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom, and opened higher this morning. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the best performer, up around 0.5%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has gained a more more modest 0.15%. And the Stoxx 600 index, which tracks major companies across the region, is up 0.3%. The markets are calmer today, as investors ponder if Donald Trump can push through tax reforms, infrastructure spending and deregulate the US economy. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The success of execution on any of these legislations is probably lower now than it was just last week, but investors are still giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt. However, if they see that these plans will face the same destiny as the Health Care Act, markets will soon turn to aggressive selling as the expected companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings growth and pace of economic recovery are not enough to support currently overstretched valuations. According to Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Mkokeli, South African president Jacob Zuma told communist parties leaders that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning to sack finance minister Pravin Gordhan. He adds: Speculation that Gordhan is on the verge of being fired has swirled for months, as he clashed with Zuma over the management of state companies and the national tax agency. While Gordhan has led efforts to keep spending in check and fend off a junk credit rating, Zuma wants to embark on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radical economic transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he says will tackle racial inequality and widespread poverty. The rand has now lost almost 5% of its value since yesterday lunchtime, when news broke that finance minister Gordhan had been summoned home; South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is suffering heavy losses in early trading, on rumours that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister is about be sacked. The rand tumbled by almost 2.2% at the open, to just 13.01 rand to the US dollar. As this video clip of the US dollar-rand exchange rate shows, it was a very sharp move indeed. South African government bonds also came under pressure, sending the yield (or interest rate) on the debt sharply higher. The selloff came after finances chief Pravin Gordhan was dramatically summoned back to South Africa, from a trip to meet investors in the UK and America. This has sparked speculation that prime minister Jacob Zuma might be planning a cabinet reshuffle. The two men have been locked in something of a power struggle recently, with Gordhan resisting pressure from Zuma to raise government spending and borrowing. They have also clashed over an influential business family, the Guptas, who are friendly with Zuma - and accused of wielding undue political influence. Bloomberg reported earlier today that Gordhan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job might be on the line. That helped to send the rand sliding, as the finance minister is popular with City investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. What goes down must come up again. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets to open higher today today, and claw back some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Last night, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones Industrial Average racked up its longest losing streak since 2011, after the Republican Party was forced to pull its proposed replacement for Obamacare. The theory in the City today is that following his failure to get healthcare reform through Congress last week, Donald Trump will be determined to achieve some tax reforms. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: President Trump may have to modify his style somewhat, and add a few chapters to his book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Art of the Deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and work on the art of the schmooze. His belligerent style may work well on the campaign trail but on Capitol Hill it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work well at all. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either, however some in the market do appear to want to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. However.... the president doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be in the mood for schmoozing. Instead, he took to Twitter last night to blame his own side for the healthcare debacle: Also coming up today.... There may be drama in South Africa, after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister was recalled from an investor roadshow yesterday; something that has worried investors. MPs on the Business committee are holding an inquiry into the Future of Work today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from, among others, Transline - the employment agency which suppliers workers to Sports Direct, and which was axed by Amazon two weeks ago. On the corporate front, building materials group Wolseley, betting chain Ladbrokes Coral, drinks maker AG Barr and top-hat-and-tails renters Moss Bros are all reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hit a new two year high and came within 200 points of its all time high of 12,392 reached in April 2015. The FTSE 100 was helped by the weakness in the pound following the triggering of Article 50, and even an early fall on Wall Street failed to pull European shares lower. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 0.41% or 30.30 points at 7373.72</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.44% to 12,203.00</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.45% to 5069.04</strong></li> <li><strong>But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.26% to 20,276.8</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.21% lower at 10,367.6</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 0.61% to 668.55</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points or 0.28%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58dbdbd1e4b01ea2330bd49f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-29T16:15:21.908Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound continues to hover above the $1.24 mark, down around 0.3% on the day when the Brexit process finally got underway.</p> <p>But it is not just Brexit of course which is responsible for the dip. The weakness of the pound against the dollar also has to do with the prospect of further US interest rate rises. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets points out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar has continued to rise after comments from Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed that he favoured one to two rates rises this year, with the euro in particular coming under pressure. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, against the euro sterling has edged up 0.2% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1535, with the single currency weakened by reports that the European Central Bank is in no rush to start winding down its low interest rate and bond buying programmes.</p> <p>The slip in the pound compared to the dollar has of course boosted the FTSE 100, which is packed full of overseas earners which benefit from weaker sterling,. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, pointed out that the triggering of Article 50 did lead to a topsy turvy day on the markets:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> A historic day for the UK and Europe as a whole has been matched by a suitably volatile day for the FTSE, with initial gains fading to red, only to rebound into the close. Perhaps today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE trade was a precursor of the times we have ahead both economically and emotionally, as this painful divorce progresses from stage to stage. First came disbelief, then came denial (calls for a second referendum), and today we moved into the reality phase, as the UK and EU alike realised that there is no going back.

However, such an agreement would likely take years of negotiation, and there are clear downside risks. Substantial new tariff or non-tariff barriers, in particular, would have an adverse impact on UK sectors that trade extensively with the EU market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Jim Leaviss, Head of Retail Fixed Interest at M&amp;G Investments</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Clearly the best scenario would be a civilised divorce, where negotiations are constructive and low-key, thereby minimising any potential impact on demand. Any signs of an acrimonious divorce, with a hardening in rhetoric on both sides, would likely result in a deeper impact on demand and possibly a recession. In this scenario, monetary policy will likely remain highly stimulatory with the possibility of another round of quantitative easing, while the UK Government may also seek to stimulate the economy through loosening the fiscal reins.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unwinding EU membership is unprecedented and the economic implications are highly uncertain. Given this uncertainty, consumers and businesses are likely to be cautious about the future economic outlook as well. However, given the UK has access to the Single Market until 2019, businesses will likely react by stockpiling inventories in anticipation of the UK possibly having to trade under WTO rules after being removed from the European Union. Additionally, consumers may bring forward consumption before tariffs are potentially placed on imports coming into the UK. Consequently, short-term economic growth may be boosted over the course of the next 12-18 months, provided real incomes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t squeezed too much by rising inflation and stagnant wage growth.</p> </blockquote> <h2> Ed Anderson, Head of Research at FxPro: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since it is in neither the UK nor EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests to make all our lives difficult, further weakness for the pound could be contained. However, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen with the Eurozone crisis things are left until the very last minute and so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be wise to prepare for a bumpy road ahead.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Alexandra Russell-Oliver, </strong>currency markets analyst at <strong>Caxton FX</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ultimately, markets will be looking ahead to the next steps in the process. The tone of negotiations going forward will be key, particularly whether the UK and the EU maintain their cooperative approach.

                "bodyText":"Shrugging off the worries about the outcome of the Brexit talks which can now get underway, most European markets managed end the day positively. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hit a new two year high and came within 200 points of its all time high of 12,392 reached in April 2015. The FTSE 100 was helped by the weakness in the pound following the triggering of Article 50, and even an early fall on Wall Street failed to pull European shares lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.41% or 30.30 points at 7373.72 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.44% to 12,203.00 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.45% to 5069.04 But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.26% to 20,276.8 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.21% lower at 10,367.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.61% to 668.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points or 0.28%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The pound continues to hover above the $1.24 mark, down around 0.3% on the day when the Brexit process finally got underway. But it is not just Brexit of course which is responsible for the dip. The weakness of the pound against the dollar also has to do with the prospect of further US interest rate rises. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets points out: The US dollar has continued to rise after comments from Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed that he favoured one to two rates rises this year, with the euro in particular coming under pressure. Meanwhile, against the euro sterling has edged up 0.2% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1535, with the single currency weakened by reports that the European Central Bank is in no rush to start winding down its low interest rate and bond buying programmes. The slip in the pound compared to the dollar has of course boosted the FTSE 100, which is packed full of overseas earners which benefit from weaker sterling,. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, pointed out that the triggering of Article 50 did lead to a topsy turvy day on the markets: A historic day for the UK and Europe as a whole has been matched by a suitably volatile day for the FTSE, with initial gains fading to red, only to rebound into the close. Perhaps today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE trade was a precursor of the times we have ahead both economically and emotionally, as this painful divorce progresses from stage to stage. First came disbelief, then came denial (calls for a second referendum), and today we moved into the reality phase, as the UK and EU alike realised that there is no going back. The forthcoming years will no doubt prove volatile and unpredictable, yet ultimately the end result is what matters most. For these negotiations will play a huge role in dictating the future prosperity and unity of the UK. Despite a degree of hostility in recent months, today was surprisingly cordial, with the conciliatory tone struck in Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter being matched by Tusk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to proclaim \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe already miss you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The lack of any real fire and divisiveness on either side will have no doubt been responsible for what was a fairly orderly day for the pound, all things considered. Oil prices are on the rise as the US reported that crude stocks rose by less than expected last week. US oil inventories climbed by 0.9m barrels to 534m barrels according to the Energy Information Administration. This compares to the 5m gain recorded in the previous week, and the 2m forecast by analysts. The news of stronger than expected demand has helped push Brent crude up 1.6% to $52.17 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate a similar amount to $49.18. Signs of recovery in the US housing market. After falling 2.8% in January, pending home sales jumped by a higher than expected 5.5% last month, a ten month high and the second best reading since May 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had forecast a rise of 2.4% month on month, and the better than expected figure was partly due to unseasonably warm weather. Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: Buyers came back in force last month as a modest, seasonal uptick in listings were enough to fuel an increase in contract signings throughout the country,. The stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued rise and steady hiring in most markets is spurring significant interest in buying, as well as the expectation from some households that delaying their home search may mean paying higher interest rates later this year. Last month being the warmest February in decades also played a role in kick-starting prospective buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 house hunt. Back with the pound, which is currently down 0.17% at $1.2427 against the dollar. It is off its worst levels but also off its high of $1.2478 which came as Theresa May unveiled the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans. Kathleen Brooks at City Index said: Article 50 happened with more of a whimper than a bang. Although the pound initially rallied it has since backed off its highs as the market gets to grip with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter to Donald Tusk and the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. Essentially both sides were polite to each other, which helped to keep volatility supressed and price action fairly muted. Hence the range in GBP/USD was only 100 pips for this historic event. Away from Brexit and the UK, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the slide in early trading. On Tuesday, the Dow avoided closing lower for the ninth day in a row, which would have been its worst performance for almost 40 years. But the respite has been brief, and it is now down 53 points or 0.26%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged lower at the open. The triggering of Article 50 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sets the stage for a challenging negotiation process with a wide range of possible outcomes regarding trade and institutional arrangements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: The uncertainty created by the EU referendum is a sovereign rating weakness for the UK (AA/Negative). But the wide spectrum of possible outcomes from negotiations means the rating is not predicated on any particular base case... The number and complexity of issues to resolve, and the multiple national interests involved will make the negotiations difficult. There is no precedent for leaving the EU, and the UK will not be in control of the negotiating agenda. Two years is a short time to reach a free trade agreement (one of the Brexit aims set out in Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17 January speech), and the time available may be less if the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal, including any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exit bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to items such as budget commitments and staff pensions, have to be agreed first. Domestic political challenges include the lack of a unified national position on Brexit, potential shifts in public opinion, and the Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current intention, backed by a vote by the Holyrood parliament, to hold a second independence referendum... [It] is possible that the UK fails to secure a future trade relationship with the EU or agreement for an implementation phase in the two years of negotiations, and reverts to WTO terms. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and likely shock to the UK economy made a WTO scenario the most negative of the three hypothetical Brexit trade scenarios we examined in December last year. The UK has not experienced an abrupt economic slowdown since the EU referendum, but our GDP forecasts reflect a weaker investment outlook due to uncertainty during the negotiation period. They also incorporate slower consumer spending growth due to higher inflation following the depreciation of sterling that occurred after the referendum. These effects are partially offset by better prospects for net trade given the weaker pound. We forecast UK GDP growth to slow to 1.5% in 2017 and 1.3% in 2018, and consumer price inflation to rise to 2.8% by end-2017 before falling back slightly to 2.6% by end-2018. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the British Chambers of Commerce, which wants a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grown up dialogue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and early news on trade deals. BCC director general Adam Marshall said: Now that Brexit negotiations are set to begin, businesses across the UK and their trading partners in Europe want answers to practical questions, not political posturing. A pragmatic and grown-up dialogue on the real-world issues, rather than verbal volleys between London and Brussels, would give firms greater confidence over the next two years. In the early weeks of the negotiation process, businesses would like to see an effort to secure simultaneous exit and trade talks. Concluding exit and trade negotiations at the same time would moderate adjustment costs for UK businesses, and enable trade between UK and EU firms to continue with less disruption. He added that the government should not focus on Brexit to the exclusion of everything else: It is crucial for the Prime Minister and her government to remember Brexit is not the only thing on the minds of UK businesses. Issues here at home, from the training system to sky-high business rates and up-front costs, still need to be addressed. Businesses would not look kindly on a government that treats Brexit as its only job. Getting the fundamentals right here in the UK is as important, if not more important, than any eventual Brexit deal. The UK bioscience industry has reacted to the triggering of Article 50 by saying the sector is used to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working with uncertainty and risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steve Bates, chief executive of the Bioindustry association, said: We welcome the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to make the UK one of the best places for science and innovation....It was also encouraging to see the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter mention the importance of prioritising \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122... Early agreement on key issues like the regulation of medicines, the regime to enable non-UK nationals to work and contribute to the UK life science ecosystem, trade, finance support, market and intellectual property rules, would be the best way to ensure speedy and continuing global inward investment into the UK and EU. It would also be in the best interest of patients who require access to innovative healthcare. During the negotiation, the BIA will continue to provide dispassionate insight and commentary on the Brexit process. We will continue to make our members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expertise available to the government and its key agencies in the coming weeks and months as we work through highly complex and technical issues. The BIA remains committed to making the UK the third global cluster for life sciences and we will work closely with government and relevant agencies to deliver this ambition. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has also produced this graphic showing the various ways in which Brexit could disrupt the UK economy, and which sectors are most vulnerable. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots of City reaction to the triggering of Article 50. Business chiefs are urging the prime minister to avoid the dreaded cliffedge, in which Britain leaves the EU in 2019 without a deal. Traders are anticipating much volatility as the talks begin. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection: Paul Drechsler, CBI President, said: The first six months are crucial as the UK heads into these challenging and unprecedented negotiations. Securing some early wins is therefore vital to set us on the right path. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most welcome of all would be the immediate guarantee of the right to remain for EU citizens here and UK nationals in Europe, which all governments agree is desirable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses will welcome the upfront commitment to an implementation period to rule out cliff-edges for firms on both sides of the Channel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though more detail will be needed. Meanwhile, we must work constructively to design a means to maintain some influence over regulations affecting UK businesses in our biggest market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And discussing new trading arrangements should go hand-in-hand with negotiating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be important to deliver on the commitment to include the devolved nations and all regions of the UK in the discussions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Colin Ellis, Moodys chief credit officer for Europe Although the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty represents an important milestone in the Brexit process, it is in line with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously stated timetable and in itself doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t materially alter our credit analysis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As negotiations between the two sides move a step closer, a key part of our assessment of the impact of Brexit will be the extent to which the UK and the EU are able to come to an agreement on their future relationship, as well as the speed with which this is achieved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our base case is that the UK and the EU will eventually come to an agreement to preserve most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but probably not all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of the current trading relationships. However, such an agreement would likely take years of negotiation, and there are clear downside risks. Substantial new tariff or non-tariff barriers, in particular, would have an adverse impact on UK sectors that trade extensively with the EU market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jim Leaviss, Head of Retail Fixed Interest at M&amp;G Investments Clearly the best scenario would be a civilised divorce, where negotiations are constructive and low-key, thereby minimising any potential impact on demand. Any signs of an acrimonious divorce, with a hardening in rhetoric on both sides, would likely result in a deeper impact on demand and possibly a recession. In this scenario, monetary policy will likely remain highly stimulatory with the possibility of another round of quantitative easing, while the UK Government may also seek to stimulate the economy through loosening the fiscal reins. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unwinding EU membership is unprecedented and the economic implications are highly uncertain. Given this uncertainty, consumers and businesses are likely to be cautious about the future economic outlook as well. However, given the UK has access to the Single Market until 2019, businesses will likely react by stockpiling inventories in anticipation of the UK possibly having to trade under WTO rules after being removed from the European Union. Additionally, consumers may bring forward consumption before tariffs are potentially placed on imports coming into the UK. Consequently, short-term economic growth may be boosted over the course of the next 12-18 months, provided real incomes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t squeezed too much by rising inflation and stagnant wage growth. Ed Anderson, Head of Research at FxPro: Since it is in neither the UK nor EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests to make all our lives difficult, further weakness for the pound could be contained. However, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen with the Eurozone crisis things are left until the very last minute and so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be wise to prepare for a bumpy road ahead. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency markets analyst at Caxton FX Ultimately, markets will be looking ahead to the next steps in the process. The tone of negotiations going forward will be key, particularly whether the UK and the EU maintain their cooperative approach. Negotiations pose a threat to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength until we get greater clarity. Further volatility is likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our Politics Live blog has comprehensive coverage of events in Westminster, and in Brussels, where European Council president Donald Tusk has said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We already miss you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Not only was the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit rally pretty small, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long either! Sterling is now back in the red, down 0.2% at $1.242. Back in the City, sterling has hit its highest level of the day as Britain formally triggers the two-year process of exiting the European Union. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small move, though - the pound gained 0.2 of a cent, or 0.25%, to $1.247. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still lower than 24 hours ago. Many of the big companies on the London stock market are sensitive to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, as it affects the value of their overseas earnings. So the FTSE 100 has now fallen into the red, down 25 points or 0.35% at 7317. Our Politics Live blog has all the details as Theresa May outlines the next steps: The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision may also mean that the LSE no longer has to sell its French clearing business, LCH Clearnet, to rival exchange Euronext. That sale was part of the LSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (failed) attempt to persuade Brussels to wave the merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse through. Now, though, it could choose to trigger an exit clause in the deal and keep Clearnet. Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah, though, sounds keen to press on with the sale, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Euronext remains a willing buyer of Clearnet SA in the terms agreed on January 3rd but in the absence of obtaining an agreement, Euronext is fully committed to securing the best long-term solution for its post-trade activities, in the interests of clients and shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That position makes a lot of sense - buying Clearnet allows Euronext to diversify beyond its traditional cash equity business (share trading). Analysts at UBS said yesterday that: {Acquiring Clearnet] would diversity Euronext\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue base. On a pro forma basis, post-trade revenues would account for 32% of Euronext\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total revenues (up from 14% on a standalone basis). Such a deal would also reduce Euronext\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliance on cash equity trading commissions from 36% of the standalone revenue base to 28% on a pro forma basis. What now for Xavier Rolet, the boss of the LSE? Rolet had planned to step aside once the merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse was compete. He hinted earlier this month that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay on if the deal failed, but there must be some uncertainty over his long-term future. Especially as the LSE could find itself on the end of another takeover bid in future, potentially from the US. John Colley, Professor of Practice at Warwick Business, says that a new CEO might be needed to deliver a new strategy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst the business is performing well at the moment there is very likely to be some fallout from Brexit. A weakened LSE may need to look west for a future partner and strategy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is likely to be plenty of interest from that quarter where Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has grown rapidly in recent years through acquisition. Dollar strength against Stirling and low costs of borrowing suggest that ICE will come calling very quickly. The LSE is now vulnerable to a bid following the failed merger and an ambivalent CEO.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The LSE-Deutsche Borse merger has a troubled time, even before the EC pulled the plug today. First there was the EU referendum, held four months after the tie-up was announced. Both sides pressed on despite the Brexit vote, with German politicians arguing that it would make sense to move LSE operations in, say, euro clearing, out of London to Frankfurt. But the two sides also reportedly clashed over where to site the headquarters of the joint business (surprise surprise, each wanted it in their own patch). And there was drama in February, when German authorities started probing Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs chief executive over his purchase of shares in the exchange just weeks before negotiations with the LSE began. Deutsche insisted Carsten Kengeter hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done anything wrong, but it added another layer of uncertainty to the deal. Shares in the London Stock Exchange have jumped by 2.7% since the decision was announced, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. The collapse of the tie-up between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great surprise. Last month, the LSE warned that the creation of a \u00c2\u00a322bn trading giant was at risk, after the EC insisted it sold its MTS division, a demand the UK firm felt was disproportionate. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main objection to the LSE-Deutsche Borse merger is that it would have hurt competition, pushing up the cost of trading, and ultimately making it more expensive to move money around the syste, As commissioner Vestager put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European economy depends on well-functioning financial markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is not just important for banks and other financial institutions. The whole economy benefits when businesses can raise money on competitive financial markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Will Brexit prevent the Commission from influencing or blocking potential deals involving the London Stock Exchange? Vestager reminds the press pack that she cleared a merger between two US companies, Dow and DuPont, on Monday. The EC had raised concerns, the firms addressed those concerns, and the deal got the green light. Vestager adds: We deal with any company who has a footprint in the European market, because we want competition in the European market, no matter your flag and no matter your ownership. That goes for everyone. Vestager denies that her decision was influenced by the fact the London Stock Exchange will be outside the European Union in two years. She says: The UK is part of the EU until it is not any more, which means it is part and parcel of the legislation and the merger review. Triggering negotiations today isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the end of the procedure, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the beginning of the procedure. The European Commission is blaming the London Stock Exchange for forcing it to block the merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse today. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager says the LSE declined to sell its Italian bond trading division, called MTS. That refusal meant that the merged company would have too dominant a position in the financial markets, Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. She says: The Commission cannot allow the creation of monopolies, and this is what would have happened in this case. And this is why we have prohibited this merger, for the benefits of competition in Europe in financial markets, to the benefit of European business and therefore also European citizens. Newsflash: European regulators have red-carded the proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. The European Commission has just announced that it is blocking the takeover, which was announced over a year ago. The deal would have created a European trading powerhouse, with a powerful position in stocks, bonds [fixed-income trading] and complex financial instruments. The EC says that the two exchanges failed to address its concerns that the offer would have hurt competition, and create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a de facto monopoly in the crucial area of fixed income instruments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is announcing the decision now; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. After a weak start, the pound is suddenly rousing itself! Sterling has clawed back this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, and is now flat against the US dollar at $1.244. Brexit didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter UK shoppers from hammering their credit cards last month, new data from the Bank of England shows. UK consumer credit rose by \u00c2\u00a31.44bn in February, down from \u00c2\u00a31.6bn in January but higher than the \u00c2\u00a31.3bn which City forecasters expected. It was driven by a 9.3% surge in borrowing on credit cards. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest rate in over a decade, according to Ben Chu of the Independent who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly crunched the data: That may show confidence about economic prospects.... or it may show that people are struggling to make ends meet as inflation eats into their wages. The report also shows a drop in mortgage approvals - from 69,114 in January to 68,315. That could be a sign that the UK housing market is cooling off. Every currency trade has two sides, of course. And the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip against the US dollar today is related to US politics, as well as Brexit. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, argues that traders are wagering that Donald Trump can get to grips with the challenge of being president, and deliver some meaningful tax changes. She says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth pointing out that the pound actually rallied when Downing Street announced the date of the triggering of Article 50 last week, and the prospect of a second Scottish referendum didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impact the pound when it was first touted a couple of weeks ago. Thus, these events are not the key driver of the pound right now. Instead, we believe that the dollar recovery will be more important for the pound in the coming days. The dollar index jumped by more than 0.5% and US stock markets closed higher for the first time in four days on Tuesday, led by financials, a sector closely aligned with Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success, suggesting that investors are willing to trust Trump again, as his policy team switch to tax reform after their failure to get their healthcare bill passed by the House of Representatives at the end of last week. Traders in Frankfurt are marking Brexit Day by driving the Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to its highest level in two years. The DAX, which contains Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest listed companies, has gained 0.6% today to 12,227 points, a level last seen in April 2015. Financial companies and manufacturers are leading the rally, with Commerzbank jumping by 2.5%, Deutsche Bank gaining 1.5%, Daimler up 1.4% and Siemens 1.3% higher. The historic fracturing of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Europe clearly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dampening the mood on the trading floors. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: In the short term nothing much is likely to change, particularly at a politically sensitive time for Europe with French and German election campaigns already well under way, which means any market reaction is likely to be fairly muted. Chris Bailey of analyst group Financial Orbit tweets: Chancellor Philip Hammond has cautioned that Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to have its cake and eat it as it leaves the EU. That means no membership of the single market, for example. Hammond argues that Britain can still achieve \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfrictionless\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 borders with Europe, though, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest to have lines of lorries queued up at Dover. He was speaking to Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme, and Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has all the details: Ryanair has issued a rather alarming warning this morning. The budget airline told shareholders there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distinct possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of no flights between the UK and Europe from March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU, if the government fails to negotiate a Brexit deal for the aviation industry. It urged the government to put the industry at the forefront of its divorce talks with the EU, to ensure that a new agreement is reached to replace Open Skies. Ryanair said the options for the government are a new bilateral agreement with the EU to allow flights between the UK and Europe or a reversion to historical WTO rules, which do not cover aviation, and therefore risk a no-flights scenario. As Westminster prepares to trigger Article 50 later today, Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Britain planning to leave the EU and its Open Skies agreement, there is a distinct possibility that there may be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time after March 2019. The best we can hope for is a new bilateral agreement between the UK and EU, however, we worry that Britain may not be able to negotiate such a bilateral in time for the release by airlines of summer 2019 schedules in mid-2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are picking up this morning, as optimism over the global economy trumps Brexit uncertainty. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 20 points, or 0.25%, and there are larger gains in continental bourses. No sign of Article 50 angst here: Investors have shaken off their worries about US politics, after Republicans failed to win support for their healthcare changes. Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping that Donald Trump can deliver his promised tax reforms. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: We do anticipate that doom gloom of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health care plan failure is going to fade soon, as it is the tax and infrastructure plan which matters the most. It is highly likely that Mr. Trump is going to check all the T&amp;C before he makes the final run with the bill in the House. This bill is going to become the centre of attention for the US markets which would drive the trading action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit jitters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have returned to the markets this week, says FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga. The Brexit jitters were revived on Tuesday evening with Sterling stumbling into steep losses after British Prime Minister Theresa May signed a letter notifying the EU of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to depart from the European Union. With the game changing Brexit letter due to be delivered to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon marking a critical turning point and triggering one of the most intricate set of negotiations Britain and the EU have ever been presented, Sterling could be in store for a rocky rollercoaster ride. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only two days since sterling was at a one-month high against the US dollar. No wonder traders joke about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplaying the Forex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122... The pound has dipped against the US dollar this morning. Sterling fell as low as $1.2378 in early trading, down over half a cent, adding to the cent it lost yesterday. That suggests there may be a twinge of Article 50 nervousness in the City (and beyond) this morning, as Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formal letter triggering the exit process arrives in Brussels. Traders will be watching for signals from Westminster, and Brussels, for how the Brexit negotiations will develop. Sterling is likely to remain vulnerable as these talks get underway, as Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: A truly hard Brexit has not been priced into sterling. We could see it move lower still if negotiations take a sour turn - $1.10 is feasible. The old hard v soft Brexit debate is once again central to expectations for the pound. Sterling will rise on any indications of a softer Brexit and fall on any signs it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be hard. If we head towards a cliff-edge then it could collapse. We are likely to see a lot of toing and froing between the various Brexit scenarios. Theresa May has set the UK on course for a hard Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no deal is better than a bad deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we can expect this to shift in due course once the EU sets out its stall. The pound has also dipped against the euro, down 0.5% at $1.1495. Such a small move backs up the theory that the triggering of Article 50 is pretty much \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Traders in Frankfurt will certainly be thinking about Brexit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sheltering in a nice dark cave for nine months, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need reminding of the main event today: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be live-blogging all that in Another Place, as they say in Westminster. And you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think that the triggering of Article 50, although clearly historic, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a huge impact on the markets. The start of the Brexit process really ought to be priced in. However, investors can be fickle beasts, so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out some volatility today as the months of shadow-boxing come to an end. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has held up pretty well since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, mainly thanks to consumer spending. So the latest UK consumer credit figures, due at 9.30am, will be pored over for signs that people are cutting back. At 3pm, new US home sales figures will give an insight into America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, after consumer confidence hit a 16-year high yesterday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followed by new oil inventory stats, which might shift the price of crude.",

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been the most exciting day in the financial markets, with traders distracted by reports of banks and insurers preparing for life after Brexit. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ended with the main European markets posting small gains, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX hitting a new two-year high. The French CAC and Italian FTSE MIB also closed up around 0.5%. Shares in exporters were boosted by a weakening euro, which dropped after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in German inflation. The FTSE 100 missed out, though, and closed down 0.06%. It was hit by a pick-up in the value of the pound, which gained half a cent to $1.249 against the US dollar. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group sums up the session: Stocks are still in a bit of a holding pattern with traders lacking a bit of conviction to follow through on the last two days of dip-buying. A positive open in the US, helped by further recovery in crude oil prices improved sentiment in European markets by the afternoon. A bigger than expected fall in German inflation during March assured investors who have been buying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in hopes of an extended period of easy money policies. The German benchmark DAX index touched a two-year high for a second day. The resilience of the British pound in the face of Article 50 uncertainty was probably the biggest factor behind the underperformance of the FTSE 100. Fund manager Schroders was the biggest loser while Ashtead Group was top gainer. And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing down for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to activate Article 50 yesterday has also encouraged City firms to trigger their own contingency plans, says Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He predicts short-term pain for London, as the Brexit process rumbles on. Lloyds of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to relocate jobs to Brussels, coupled with rumours of potential relocations for the likes of Citi and JP Morgan do little to inspire confidence in the City of London. There is no doubt that London will be the main loser from the coming two years of negotiations, much in the same way it was the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main beneficiary from our EU membership. While the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss may be the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gain in the short-term, the long-term picture of a more open, globalised UK should mean that perhaps the EU and the UK will be better off further down the line. Another investment bank, Citigroup, has told its staff that some London-based jobs will move overseas due to Britain leaving the EU. Jim Cowles, the head of Citi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told staff in an internal memo that planning has been underway for months. Cowles explained that Citi expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, losing membership of the single market and the Customs Union), adding; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hard Brexit would require certain changes, including relocating certain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK, and the possible creation of a new broker-dealer entity within the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another Brexity development, Luxembourg has thrown its hat into the ring to become the new home of the European Banking Authority. The EBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibilities include holding the regular European-wide banking stress tests. It is currently based in London, which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sustainable once Britain has left the EU. Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Vienna have all reportedly been batting their eyelashes at the EBA. The EC has suggested it could be merged with a pensions regulator, based in Germany. Luxembourg, though, claims it has a legal right to host the EBA, citing a letter from 1965 which said it would be considered as a host for financial institutions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans: The Liberal Democrats are worried that JP Morgan and Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could be signalling an exodus from the City. Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153David Davis has already gone back on his assurances that British firms would continue to enjoy all the benefits of single market membership in his post-Brexit utopia. Now reality is starting to intervene, with JP Morgan reportedly looking to move 1,000 jobs out of London. This follows Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London saying it will open an office in Brussels due to Brexit and become, at least in part, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of Brussels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice to drive Britain out of the single market, and that is driving jobs and wealth creation out of the UK. Estimates suggest leaving the single market could cost Britain up to \u00c2\u00a3200bn over 15 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the P45s start to land and the NHS operations are cancelled, this will be the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only companies considering moving jobs out of the UK after Brexit. Two fifths of computer games companies based in the UK are considering relocating out of the country, a new survey has found. The industry fears that it will lose access to international talent from the EU, and funds administered by Brussels. More here: Newsflash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen, and by even more than expected. The German Consumer Prices Index rose by just 1.5% annually this month, down from the four-year high of 2.2% scaled in February. Economists expected it to drop to 1.9%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because Easter fell in late March in 2016, but this year isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until mid-April. Prices usually rise around the Easter holidays, partly due to higher transport costs. But even so, this should take some pressure off the European Central Bank to start tightening monetary policy. The overall eurozone inflation rate, announced on Friday morning, is on track to fall from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2%. We mentioned earlier that Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London is planning to shift \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Brussels, rather than whole floors of staff from London. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s George Hay has dubbed this an example of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phantom exodus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and suspects that fewer staff will leave the City than feared. He writes: There is no way to spin this outflow as a good thing. Even if every financial firm moves only 10 percent of staff, that could still risk a tangible proportion of the 71 billion pounds of tax from financial services companies generated in 2016. UBS has said a fifth of its 5,000 London staff could be affected by Brexit, while a quarter of JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16,000 UK staff could be. Still, anecdotally bankers at the big firms think the exodus will be less, and London will retain its financial hub status. While a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK on favourable terms for finance seems far-fetched, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday said that a future free trade agreement ought to cover financial services. More simply, not many financial types want to leave London. As such, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is merely doing what every other firm is doing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c acquiring an option that it hopes will expire, out of the money. More here: Just in: A former investment banker has been fined over \u00c2\u00a337,000 for sharing confidential client information over the WhatsApp messaging service. The Financial Conduct Authority imposed the penalty on Christopher Niehaus, ruling that he failed to act with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due skill, care and diligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It explains: The FCA found that Mr Niehaus, who was a managing director in the Investment Banking division at Jefferies International Limited, received client confidential information during the course of his employment and, on a number of occasions between 24 January and 16 May 2016, shared that information with both a personal acquaintance and a friend, who was also a client of the firm. In one of the instances where Mr Niehaus shared client confidential information with his friend, who was also a client of the firm, that information was about a competitor. Mr Niehaus used the instant messaging application WhatsApp to share this information. The information was shared by Mr Niehaus because he wanted to impress the people that he shared the information with. The details of the information he shared included the identity of the client, the details relating to the client mandate and the fee Jefferies would charge for their involvement in the transaction. Mr Niehaus also boasted about how he may be able to pay off his mortgage if one of the deals was successful. None of the parties traded on the information shared, the FCA adds. Even so, Niehaus resigned from Jefferies after being suspended, after the WhatsApping came to light. More here. Bloomberg is also reporting that JPMorgan is in talks to buy office space in Dublin in response to Brexit. It believes the bank wants enough room for over 1,000 workers. It says The lender is negotiating the potential purchase of a building in Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Dock that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being developed by a venture between Kennedy Wilson Holdings Inc. and Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Asset Management Agency, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans are private. The building, at 200 Capital Dock, has about 130,000 square feet (12,000 square meters) of space, the people said. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough for more than 1,000 workers. In another potential blow to the City, JP Morgan is reportedly considering moving hundreds of jobs to Dublin. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Irish Independent this morning, which reports: US investment banking giant JP Morgan is understood to be considering the relocation of hundreds of its employees from London to Capital Dock, the 31,600 sq m (340,000 sq ft) office scheme currently being developed by Kennedy Wilson in Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s docklands. News of JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential post-Brexit move will be welcomed, coming as it does in the wake of the decision by two major insurance companies, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London and AIG, to choose Brussels and Luxembourg instead of Dublin for their respective European Union bases. While a source familiar with the matter insisted that a decision on Capital Dock was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still up in the air\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intentions in relation to the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices are currently the subject of intense speculation within Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial real estate sector. The Irish Independent understands that JP Morgan has been engaged in a search for space capable of accomodating employees from both its existing offices at George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dock in Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Financial Services Centre and up to 500 personnel currently working within its London operations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: JP Morgan eyes Capital Dock for Brexit relocation It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that JP Morgan has been considering moving staff out of the City. Before the referendum, CEO Jamie Dimon warned that up to 4,000 jobs could be lost from London if the public voted for Brexit. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street Journal reports that the investment bank has been weighing up the respective charms of several cities, including Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin. As with Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London, such a move would allow JP Morgan to retain those passporting rights to offer financial services within the EU (which the City will lose if Britain quits the single market). Economic confidence across the eurozone has dipped a little this month, according to the latest survey from the European Commission. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of investor and consumer sentiment in the region dipped to 107.9 this month, from 108 in February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected, but still close to a five-year high. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to revise Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, even though it has a better idea of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy. S&amp;P has had Britain on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 since June 27, the Monday after the EU referendum, when it also ripped away the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple-A rating. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the rating is more likely to be cut again than raised. Moritz Kraemer, S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of sovereign ratings, has told Reuters no reason to change that view, following the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement on Wednesday that Brexit has begun. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Kraemer...said May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was largely as expected and there had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no surprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though her tone was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more conciliatory than it could have been\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The (EU) governments know that they have to hold the (Brexit) discussions in good faith,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Reuters. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has proved far more resilient to uncertainty caused by the Brexit process than most economists - including those from S&amp;P - had predicted. That has raised questions as to whether the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative outlook, which suggests a greater chance of another rating cut, is still justified. In Kraemer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view it is. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have seen nothing recently to make us rethink the negative outlook on the UK rating,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. More here: No reason to rethink UK rating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative outlook: S&amp;P There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much drama in the foreign exchange market either. Sterling is hovering around the $1.241 level, a dip of 0.2% today, and slightly below its level before Britain formally triggered Article 50. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up slightly against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.156, meaning one euro is worth 86.5p. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote, the Switzerland bank, believes sterling might actually rally this year as the Brexit talks proceed. Losing 20% in the wake of the referendum vote, the weaker sterling has provided the UK with a strong exports boost. Strengthening of the pound is now very likely especially as Europe faces a veritable minefield with the upcoming French and German elections. Time to reload GBP. [Great British Pounds] Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary, David Davis, is touring the broadcasting studios this morning. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s denying that the UK is blackmailing Europe by using security co-operation as a bargaining chip, and trying to play down the idea of a huge exit bill. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has all the details: You might have expected European financial markets to be rattled by the formal opening of the Brexit process. But no. Trading is extremely sluggish across the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges this morning. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the 600 largest companies in the region, has crept up by a mere 0.09%. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a meagre 5 points. But this soporific mood probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, once the UK actually begins the tussle with the rest of the EU. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx warns: The European markets are looking pretty sleepy this morning, lacking the direction provided by the Trump slump and Article 50 earlier in the week. However, with the real Brexit negotiations looming these kinds of placid opens may soon be a distant memory. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale also spies trouble ahead: In the UK dawn has broken over the new post-Article 50 environment. A beautiful red sunrise greeted me as I arrived at work, warning of rain even as the weather forecasters promise me the warmest day of the year so far. The bickering has already started over the order in which the exit can be negotiated and the uncertainty about the economic impact isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. Now this is interesting.... Inga Beale, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has revealed that they chose Brussels partly because Belgium is unlikely to follow Britain out of the EU. Speaking on BBC News, Beale said the group wanted a location with strong regulation, and good access to talent, which could be reached easily from London and other parts of Europe. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also wanted to think about the likelyhood of the country remaining in the EU too, Beale explained. She added that it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantastic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Britain negotiated a deal that meant City firms retained their passporting rights in Europe [allowing them to sell services to every country in the EU from one site]. But as that now seems unlikely, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is pressing on with the move to Brussels. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London chairman John Nelson has said the new Brussels operation will employ \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of staff; a mixture of new hires and existing workers who will transfer to Belgium. He adds that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to say\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whether other insurers will make a similar move, but points out that other Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hubs have created their own ecosystems. So we might find that some of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers - the insurance brokers who trade on its market - shift jobs to Brussels too. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to open a new EU hub in Brussels is causing a stir. Bloomberg points out that other companies will be considering similar action: British companies and international financial firms are considering how to continue serving European clients should the U.K. withdraw not just from the EU, but also from its single market and customs union, both of which can accommodate countries that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the bloc. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack reckons Downing Street won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate the move, even though Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also maintaining its main headquarters in London. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets wonders if a name change might be needed: That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long. Just a day after Britain triggered article 50, one of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most established names announced plans to open a new office in Brussels. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London, the insurance market that famously began in a coffee house, will create a subsidiary in the Belgian capital so it can retain its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Europe. Those rights are essential to keep offering financial services across the EU from. Under the plan, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will have its new office ready in time for the 2019 underwriting season -- to minimise the disruption from Brexit. Up to 100 staff are likely to move. CEO Inga Beale says it will provide \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcefficient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 access to Europe, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is now crucial that the UK government and the European Union proceed to negotiate an agreement that allows business to continue to flow under the best possible conditions once the UK formally leaves the EU. I believe it is important not just for the City but also for Europe that we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julia Kollewe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the announcement, and Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest financial results: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The City feels rather subdued this morning after the drama of seeing Britain hit the exit button to quit the European Union yesterday. Traders are watching to see how the opening exchanges pan out...and there are already worrying signs, with EU officials unhappy that the UK is threatening that security co-operation will suffer unless it gets a decent deal. Investors may also be alarmed that the two side are also at odds, already, over the negotiating process. Britain wants to discuss the terms of the divorce, and the future relationship, at the same time - but Germany insists the exit bill is agreed first. So faced with this impasse, investors are taking a cautious approach this morning. And that means the pound is serenely flat in early trading, at $1.243 against the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equally unruffled against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1551 - the same as last night. Equities are calm too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 8 points in early trading, to 7382 points. No drama here (yet anyway). FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed believes Brexit will be a tricky event for the City. Traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen such a historic event before, and Wednesday marked the official countdown of UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divorce from the EU, ending a 44-year relationship with its neighbors. The end of this relationship is of course painful, but many agree that this marriage was not a case of love at first sight after all. Investors decided not to take any significant action on Wednesday, the GBP-USD traded within 70 pips trading range, and all major European equity markets closed higher. Predicting currency movements was never an easy task, and in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a more complicated situation given that we never experienced such a divorce in the past. Economic conditions in the U.K. are in a much better shape than what was anticipated nine months ago, with most economic indicators surprising to the upside. Meanwhile, the BoE is likely to turn more hawkish as the depreciation of sterling continues to feed through to increased prices. These factors helped the pound to find a floor in the past 6-months, but the forward outlook will much depend on how negotiations progress in the next couple of months. Coming up this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some interesting economic data on the calendar today, which might move the markets. 10am BST: The latest Eurozone economic confidence reading; expected to be a little higher this month as the European economy picks up 1pm BST: German inflation figures for March. The CPI rate is expected to drop to 1.8%, down from 2.2% in February, partly because Easter comes later this year. A higher reading would increase the pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in its stimulus measures 1.30pm BST: Updated US GDP figures for the last quarter of 2016. Economists predict that the annualised growth rate could be revised up to 2.0% (or 0.5% quarter-on-quarter), from 1.9%.",

                "bodyText":"More signs of growing activity from US oil companies, with drills added for the eleventh week in a row. The Baker Hughes rig count showed 15 rigs were added last week, taking the total to 824, which is 374 higher than this time last year. This marks the best quarter for rigs being added since the second quarter of 2011. In all ten oil rigs and five gas were added last week. Brent crude is virtually unchanged on the news, down 0.65 at $52.65 a barrel. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a particularly good quarter for oil prices despite the agreed production quotas for OPEC, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to see why when you look at the rise in the US rig count since the beginning of this year...This return of US shale, and record inventories has taken the edge off any expectation that oil producers will be able to engineer higher prices in the short term. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. It has been a positive quarter for markets but it drifted away somewhat on the final day. The FTSE 100 rose for the fourth quarter in a row, as the drop in the pound following the Brexit vote continued to boost overseas earnings. But a dip in commodity companies as metal prices fell, plus a drop in South African-related stocks such as Old Mutual following the sacking of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, saw the index slip back on the day. The pound meanwhile managed to edge up slightly between January and March after six quarters of decline, while oil fell around 7% during the period. This marks crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst quarterly performance since late 2015, as investors worried that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cuts were being outweighed by growing output from US shale producers. Elsewhere Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax recorded its third successive quarter of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average - despite dipping on the day so far - is on course for a sixth successive quarterly gain. The Trump boost to US markets have meant they have held on to most of their recent rises even though doubts about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to enact his programme are growing, particularly in the wake of the healthcare defeat. Meanwhile, with the US Federal Reserve , emerging markets are also recovering: the MSCI Emerging Market Index has recorded its best quarter since 2012. The final scores for the day in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.60 points or 0.63% to 7322.92 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.46% to 12,312.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.65% at 5122.51 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.61% to 20,492.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 10,462.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.65% to 666.06 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently down 25 points or 0.12%. As the quarter drifts to a close, the FTSE 100 is on course for its fourth quarter of straight gains as dollar earners boosted the index in the wake of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Brexit slump. Despite the gains, the quarter is ending on a downbeat note, with the index currently 23 points or 0.3% lower but the decline may not last into the next three months, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Those hoping for more downside in equities once the second quarter gets underway should beware the impact of seasonality. April, far from being the cruellest month for equity markets, is in fact one of the strongest historically, and over the past twenty years it is the strongest. This time could be different, but given an reflationary environment, economic growth and still relatively accommodative central bank policies, does it really make sense to argue with history? Over in Greece, there is more uncertainty after EU officials ruled out negotiations over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout programme being wrapped up any time soon. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Adding to the intense speculation now swirling around debt- stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to conclude fraught bailout talks in the coming weeks, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem dismissed any possibility of the review being concluded at the next eurogroup session on April 7. The Malta meeting of euro area finance ministers had been mooted as the next deadline for the impasse between Greece and its creditors to finally be broken. Speaking after hopes were dashed that the deadlock would be resolved at a Euro Working Group on Thursday evening, the euroroup chairman told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The review will not be completed at the next euro group. We hope we can approve it soon but that will not happen on 7 April in Valletta.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If Greece is to realistically conclude talks with creditors in time for massive debt repayments to be paid on 7 July, this needs to be done by May at the latest, insiders say. Any additional delay would reignite fears of a Greek default and unnerve markets. But the differences are manifest and myriad. The leftist-led government, which appears to have given ground on demands for yet more pension cuts and tax increases, is determined not to yield on what it sees as the illogical demands of the IMF for further liberalisation of the labour market. Energy reforms and the spectre of additional job losses have stoked deep disgruntlement in the ranks of the ruling Syriza party amid growing speculation of leftist MPS refusing to endorse the measures - and a government crisis erupting - when they are put to vote just before Easter. European markets are edging higher as we head to the close of trading, but the FTSE 100 is still lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 41 points after a host of US data. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was plenty of US data for investors to deal with this afternoon; they just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that interested. The core PCE price index slipped from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month, while personal spending and income fell to 0.1% and 0.4% respectively. The Chicago PMI then rose to a better than forecast 57.7, something that was countered by a worse than estimated drop in consumer sentiment to 96.9. But, as mentioned, none of this mattered to investors, who seemed keen to end the quarter quietly. The Dow Jones trickled 0.2% lower after the bell, taking the index just the wrong side of 20700, but still up from where it was during Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump slump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Considering how soft the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures were this morning it is surprising that the region has been so lifeless. Perhaps the euro had time to prepare following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak German CPI reading, meaning the currency merely maintained its month low against the pound rather than seeing its losses widen. The flatness of the euro did nothing for the Eurozone indices, with both the CAC and DAX, the latter admittedly at a 2 year high, shrugging their way through the day. As for the FTSE, the UK index was Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer, dropping 0.4% thanks to a wave of red in its commodity stocks. The pound couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much with the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent data, holding on to most of its Thursday growth against the euro while giving back 0.1% to the dollar. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commodity stocks were hit by lower metal prices, while South Africa focused stocks such as investment group Old Mutual and packaging firm Mondi were weaker after the sacking of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Pravin Gordhan. Following the weaker than expecting US spending figures, it is probably not a surprise that consumer confidence was lower than expected this month. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer sentiment index came in at 96.9 for March, up from February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 96.3 but below expectations of a figure of 97.6. And now some stronger than expected US data. The Chicago purchasing managers index for March has come in at 57.7, up from 57.4 in February and better than the forecast figure of 56.9. In line with other global markets, Wall Street has edged lower as investors decided to take some profits on the last day of the quarter. The first three months of the year have seen the strongest January to March performance in four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 31 points or 0.15%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened down a similar amount percentage-wise. Still with the US, and new data shows that consumer spending was virtually flat in February, and lower that forecasts. According to the Commerce Department, consumer spending rose just 0.1% last month following a 0.2% gain in January. The February increase was the lowest since August 2016 and fell short of expectations of a 0.2% gain. Analysts said part of the reason for the meagre increase was that the government delayed issuing income tax refunds this year in an effort to combat fraud. The personal consumer expenditures price index excluding food and energy - the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred inflation measure - rose 0.2% in February month on month and 1.8% on an annual basis. This is below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2% but the central bank is still on track for further interest rate rises this year. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for some lunchtime reading, check out this piece on Bloomberg on how financial workers in New York (and beyond, one imagines) are using WhatsApp to avoid compliance checks and share information. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Favorite Way to Swap Secrets Is Against the Rules Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: How encrypted messaging is used varies widely on Wall Street. At the big banks, employees will often use such apps to share gossip, tell clients during morning sales meetings what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to buy and sell (often within sight of their bosses) or even boast about a particularly profitable trade, the people said. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mindset prevails. After betting big on Brexit, junk-bond traders at one of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks crowed about plans for a blowout celebration in a large WhatsApp chat group that included friends from rival firms.... More here: For those of you who want to dig into the details, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some links to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: For the current account deficit: Balance of Payments: Oct to Dec and annual 2016 For the fall in the savings rate: Quarterly sector accounts: Oct to Dec 2016 For the fall in Service sector output in January: UK index of services: Jan 2017 For the latest growth figures: Quarterly National Accounts: Oct to Dec 2016 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the fall in the savings ratio, and what it means for the UK economy: Meanwhile in the eurozone, Mario Draghi might be tempted to enjoy a glass of gavi with his lunch, following the latest inflation data. Inflation in the eurozone tumbled to just 1.5% this month, according to new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figures, down from 2% in February. That takes the Consumer Prices Index back below the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, and means president Draghi might feel less pressure from hawkish colleagues to slow his stimulus programme. However...it may not last. Economists point out that the slowdown is partly because Easter was in March last year, but comes in April in 2017. That means the traditional jump in airline prices, and certain foods, is coming later this year. In another concerning development, the UK service sector suffered a small contraction in January. Services output decreased by 0.1% between December 2016 and January 2017, says the ONS. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only the fourth monthly fall since January 2015. It may show that the dominant sector of the UK economy has slowed a little. Monthly data can be volatile, of course, especially straight after Christmas. In the three months to January, service output rose by 0.6% - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with the average, but does show a slowdown compared to the previous quarter. The ONS blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a slowdown in the distribution, hotels and restaurants component\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Earlier this week we learned that UK borrowing on credit cards had hit an 11-year high; another sign that people are feeling a financial squeeze. With saving on the slide, and disposable incomes falling, some experts fear that consumers are stoking up serious problems. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is very concerned, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures should set alarm bells ringing. The last thing our economy needs right now is another consumer debt crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with wage growth stalling and prices rising, many households are having to rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People raiding their piggy banks and borrowing more than they can afford is what helped drive the last financial crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to set out a plan for how they will protect living standards as we leave the EU. This must include a more ambitious programme for infrastructure spending to create better-paid jobs across the country. And end the unfair pay restrictions for public sector workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group has a theory for why Britons are saving less... The Bank of England may be worried by the slump in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings ratio to that record low of just 3.5%. As the Indie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Chu points out, the Bank had predicted it would fall -- but not as sharply as this! The fall in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit is partly thanks to the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote. The cheaper pound makes imports pricier and exports more competitive, so it should cushion UK firms from the impact of Britain leaving the EU. Shilen Shah, bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, explains: The uncertainty created by Brexit led to some weakness in business investment during the quarter, however the weakness in Sterling did lead to an improvement in the current account, with the trade component leading the charge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dario Perkins of City firm TS Lombard says there are two reasons why Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings ratio has hit record lows: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned by the fall in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings ratio and disposable incomes: Beck says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are worrying signs in the data on the household sector, with a further drop in real incomes meaning that the savings ratio fell to the lowest level on record. Given that this pre-dates the worst of the inflationary pressures, it provides further evidence that 2017 is likely to be a very tough year for the consumer, with little or no scope to offset the headwinds from higher inflation by borrowing more. And given that higher household borrowing was a key part of the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong forecast for GDP growth, there must be a good chance that this will not be achieved, strengthening the case for a lengthy period of monetary policy inaction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bad news! Britains households are saving less than at any time since record began over 60 years ago, as household disposable incomes slide. The UK saving ratio shrank to 3.3% in the last quarter, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows, a sharp slide from 5.3% in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest savings ratio since it started being measured in 1963 (Between the end of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chatterley\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ban and the Beatles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first LP.) The savings ratio is the difference between aggregate spending and income in the household sector, and therefore measures the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income. The ONS also found that disposable incomes fell in the quarter - another sign that households are being squeezed by falling wage growth and rising inflation. The ONS says: The saving ratio fell to 3.3% in Quarter 4 2016, the lowest rate on record. The saving ratio has been declining since Quarter 3 2015 which primarily reflects stronger growth in consumer spending outweighing the rate of growth in household disposable income. Strong growth in consumer spending comes on the back of robust labour market activity, while the slowing in household disposable income growth largely reflects a fall in other investment income from property income. There are also \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctechnical reasons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the fall in the savings ratio, including changes to pension funds holdings. But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying sign: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show how Britain runs a large trade deficit with Europe, and a surplus with the rest of the world. The UK-EU trade deficit came in at \u00c2\u00a319.5bn in October-December 2016, down from \u00c2\u00a322.7bn in July-September,. And Britain ran a trade surplus of \u00c2\u00a37.4bn with the rest of the world, compared with a\u00c2\u00a33.0bn deficit in Q3. The ONS says: This was due mainly to the movements in erratic items widening the total trade surplus from \u00c2\u00a32.6 billion in Quarter 3 2016 to a surplus of \u00c2\u00a313.6 billion in Quarter 4 2016. Good news! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit with the rest of the world has shrunk sharply. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit was \u00c2\u00a312.bn in October-December 2016, less than half the \u00c2\u00a325.7bn racked up in the third quarter of last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly thanks to a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit, the Office for National Statistics says. It means the current account deficit is just 2.4% of GDP, the lowest rate since the second quarter of 2011, and rather better than three months ago Breaking: Britain has cemented its place as the second-fastest growing advanced economy last year. UK GDP rose by 0.7% in the October-December period, the Office for National Statistics reports, unchanged from the earlier reading. That means Britain grew by 1.8% in 2016 - just behind Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.9%, but ahead of other G7 members. The ONS report also shows that Service sector grew by 0.8% - matching the earlier estimate Industry grew by 0.4%, up from 0.3%. Construction grew by 1.0%, up from 0.2% Business investment shrank by 0.9%, up from - 1.0% The ONS says: UK GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016 saw a continuation of strong consumer spending and strong output in consumer-focused industries; there has been a slowdown within business investment which fell by 0.9% driven by falls within the other buildings and structures and transport equipment assets, although this is a slightly improved picture from the second estimate of GDP, being revised up by 0.1 percentage points. More to follow.... UK households are still nervous about their financial situation as the Brexit process gets underway, a new report has shown. The Consumer Confidence Index produced by polling firm GfK came in at minus 6 in March, unchanged from February.. Joe Staton, Head of Market Dynamics at GfK, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers remain cagey about the state of their personal finances and the general economic picture for the UK, especially as wage growth fails to keep pace with the rising costs of living. This chart shows how consumer confidence has been negative since the referendum: Analysts at Barclays think it could weaken further as Brexit played out: We continue to expect overall confidence to soften in the course of this year, in line with weaker activity and slowing real income as inflation peaks just above 3% by mid-year. Confidence with regard to the wider economy could also deteriorate further as consumers begin to register the economic impact of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU, now that article 50 has been triggered and that negotiations are set to start. A separate report has found that British business confidence has fallen this month as expectations for economic growth weaken. The latest Business Barometer from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking showed that 48% of companies were more optimistic about the economy, down by 2 points from last month, while 28% were less optimistic, up by 12 points. That created a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnet balance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for economic optimism of just 20%, down by 14 percentage points. The net balance of companies with a positive outlook for their individual prospects dropped 5 percentage points to 35%. Newsflash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new post-reunification low. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 30,000 in March, to 2.556 million, new figures show. That pulls the jobless rate down from 5.9% to 5.8%. European markets have fallen in early trading, as investors prepare for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth figures and the eurozone inflation reading. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 23 points, or 0.3%, to 7345. South African-focused insurer Old Mutual is the top faller, down 7.5% amid the political crisis triggered by the sacking of finance minister Gordhan overnight. There may also be some profit taking as we approach the end of the first quarter of 2017. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Market weakness may be explained by an element of risk-off into the week-, month- and quarter-end following one of the best starts to the year since 2013. This despite political risk aplenty, the most recent coming from South Africa. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has taken another step towards extricating itself from the financial sector, nearly 10 years after the credit crunch struck. The Treasury has sealed a deal to sell \u00c2\u00a311.8bn worth of loans made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, the building society which was nationalised in the wild days of autumn 2008. The mortgages will be sold to Prudential plc and to funds managed by Blackstone. The proceeds of the sale will allow Bradford &amp; Bingley to repay some of the \u00c2\u00a315.65bn cost of its rescue. Chancellor Philip Hammond says the deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the taxpayer, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sale of these Bradford &amp; Bingley assets for \u00c2\u00a311.8 billion marks another major milestone in our plan to get taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money back following the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are determined to return the financial assets we own to the private sector and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale is further proof of the confidence investors have in the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the task isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete yet. Before today, the government held around \u00c2\u00a316bn of loans made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, and further loan sales are expected before the end of 2018. Is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market catching a spring cold? Prices fell by 0.3% in March, according to the latest data from Nationwide, the first monthly fall since June 2015. On an annual basis (a better measure), growth slowed to just 3.5% - the weakest level since August 2015. With home ownership now at its lowest rate since 1985, this might bring some relief to those trying desperately to grab onto the bottom rung of the housing ladder. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed picture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd across the UK. Six regions saw the pace of house price growth accelerate, six saw a deceleration and one (East Midlands) recorded the same rate as the previous quarter. Interestingly, the spread in the annual rate of change between the weakest and strongest performing regions was at its narrowest since 1978 at 6.8 percentage points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second smallest gap on record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The South of England continued to see slightly stronger price growth than the North of England, but there was a further narrowing in the differential. Northern Ireland saw a slight pickup in annual house price growth, while conditions remained relatively subdued in Scotland and Wales. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments, shows how the market has slowed since last summer: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two fairly interesting pieces of economic data are coming up this morning. At 9.30am, the third and final estimate of UK growth in the final quarter of 2016 is published. The top line, that Britain grew by a robust 0.7%, probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also learn how much of a current account deficit was racked up with the rest of the world. Economists are predicting that this deficit shrank, to perhaps \u00c2\u00a316bn from \u00c2\u00a325bn in July-September. RBC Capital Markets say: The National Accounts will bring news of the current account deficit for Q4 2016 where the smallest trade deficit since Q2 2011 should be a contributing factor to a narrowing in the overall current account deficit from the 5.2% recorded in Q3. New service sector data for January will also give an early hint on how the UK economy began 2017. Then at 10am, the flash estimate for eurozone inflation this month hits the wires. In February, the cost of living jumped by 2% - unleashing calls for the European Central Bank to stop its money-printing stimulus programme. Those voices may fall quiet today; eurozone inflation is expected to have dropped this month, perhaps to 1.8%, partly thanks to Easter falling later this year. A low inflation reading could trigger some euro-selling, as it would suggest the ECB would maintain ultraloose monetary policy for longer. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Last month we saw CPI hit the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target for the first time in four years, however this is expected to slip back to 1.8%, while core prices could also slip back from their current 0.9% to 0.8%. Anything weaker than this is likely to pressure the euro further in the short term. So it could be a lively morning.... Also coming up today Building society Nationwide is warning that the UK housing market is slowing, as it publishes its latest house price figures. More on that shortly. Uk telecoms regulator Ofcom is outlining plans to cut broadband prices, by making it easier for rival operators to access BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superfast network. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets may be lively, after prime minister Jacob Zuma fired his finance minister, Pravin Gordhan. The rand has already taken it badly, falling 2% in early trading.",
