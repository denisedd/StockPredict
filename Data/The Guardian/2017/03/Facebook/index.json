                "bodyText":"Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take control of the whole of Sky through his entertainment business 21st Century Fox should be rejected on competition grounds alone, according to research to be published on Wednesday. In a submission to the minister considering the bid, campaigners at the Media Reform Coalition and online activist network Avaaz argue that the overall market shares of both Murdoch-owned newspapers the Sun and the Times as well as Sky remain \u201cmaterially unchanged\u201d since 2011, when media regulator Ofcom raised concerns about a similar takeover. The report, which urges the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, to reject the bid given the \u201cunprecedented case for intervention on plurality grounds\u201d, is to land on her desk as Fox is expected to formally notify the European competition regulator of its \u00a311.7bn bid for full control of Sky this week. Justin Schlosberg, the chair of the coalition, said the situation in terms of media competition was \u201cdefinitely no better than last time and probably worse\u201d. In support, he cited the fact that the Sun\u2019s audience reach had increased after the removal of the paywall for its digital content despite declining print circulation; the increased reach for Sky television services through digital services such as YouTube; and research from Cardiff University last year that the newspapers had a disproportionate impact on broadcasters, for example. Cardiff University research on coverage of the 2015 general election \u201cdemonstrates the influence of national newspapers \u2013 and News UK titles in particular \u2013 over the issue agenda of broadcasters including the BBC\u201d, it said. Supporters of the bid by Fox, which is 39% owned by the Murdochs, have argued that an increasingly competitive media landscape with digital rivals such as Google and Facebook has diminished the influence of the family\u2019s media empire in the UK. Fox executives have argued that there is no need even for a referral given the increased competition. However, the coalition, which argues that the British media market place is one of the most concentrated in the world, believes media concentration has increased since 2011. In the summary to the report, the coalition argues that its objections are \u201clinked to, but separate from\u201d the concerns over the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test. This was raised during the last attempt by the Murdochs to take over the whole of Sky at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Separately, Lord Puttnam has introduced an amendment to the digital economy bill, which would subject all media takeovers to the fit and proper test and which is expected to be debated in the House of Lords. This comes after a group of cross-party politicians including Ed Miliband has demanded that the regulator launch an immediate review of whether James Murdoch meets such a test to hold a UK broadcasting licence. Given that James Murdoch is the chairman of Sky, Fox supporters believe there are no grounds for such a test. The report, Consolidating Control: the Fox/News merger and news plurality in the UK, also raises concerns about the \u201ceditorial independence of Sky News, one of only two British television news channels with an average monthly audience reach of 10 million\u201d. The coalition argues that Sky News online is the most widely featured news source on Yahoo\u2019s UK news page, accounting for more than 25% of articles in February 2017 and over 50% of headlines.",

But the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. </p> <p>Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. </p> <p>Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u2019s foreign direct investment-focused economic model.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u2019s economic success and Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. </p> <p>Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u2019s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u2019s public finances would also be negatively affected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b8073fe4b09c1763ef5648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T12:17:31.356Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer McKeown</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> February\u2019s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u2019s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued.

Here\u2019s their take \u2026 Perhaps it is time to remind ourselves why Snapchat has become so big. Something to do with celebrities and selfies? And Lewis Hamilton, apparently. And here it is, Reuters are reporting (in capital letters): SNAP INC OPENS AT $24 ON NYSE VS $17 IPO PRICE The price is still edging up, it seems. This just in from Reuters\u2026 The indicative opening price for Snap Inc has edged up to $22-$24 a share. Shares in the Snapchat owner have an indicative opening price of $21-$23 a share. So that takes them more than 30% higher than the IPP price of $17 a share. Still waiting for Snap\u2019s share price to come in. In the meantime, here\u2019s more about the company\u2019s messaging app, Snapchat: While we wait for trading in Snap to get underway, here\u2019s how US markets opened: Dow Jones: -0.04% at 21,108 S&amp;P 500: -0.15% at 2,392 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,896 No new records yet... Snap\u2019s chief executive Evan Spiegel and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy have rung the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Excitement is building ahead of Snap\u2019s debut trading session on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the company behind the messaging app are expected to soar after the IPO was over subscribed by more than 10 times. After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, Snap has a market value of roughly $24bn. The US President is expected to speak to the Greek prime minister in the coming days. The substance of the call, according to well-placed sources, will be Greece\u2019s ongoing negotiations with creditors and the role the International Monetary Fund may or may not play in the country\u2019s current rescue programme. Donald Trump has publicly tweeted that he thinks the Greeks are \u201cwasting their time\u201d staying in the eurozone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u2019s voting power, Washington has effective veto power over many decisions. The IMF has yet to sign up to Greece\u2019s third bailout programme, with Germany and the Netherlands saying its participation is vital if further emergency loans are to be disbursed to the debt-stricken country. \u201cThe government is attaching great significance to the conversation in its bid to get a clearer picture of Trump\u2019s position on several issues, not least the Greek bailout program,\u201d the Kathimerini news paper wrote today. With tensions also rising in the Aegean between regional rivals Greece and Turkey, Athens is also placing stock in Washington\u2019s interventionist powers, diplomats say. President Barack Obama, who chose to give his farewell speech abroad in the Greek capital, was aggressively supportive of Greece remaining in the single currency, stepping in when the country came closest yet to leaving the euro six months after Tsipras assumed power in mid-2015. Trump\u2019s Whitehouse chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is of Greek descent, told a visiting Greek delegation ahead of the president\u2019s swearing-in that the new administration was determined to \u201cfix Greece\u201d, although he failed to make clear whether he meant in or out of the eurozone. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 44-year low last week, beating expectations. There were 223,000 new claims in the week ending 25 February, lower than the 243,000 predicted by economists and lower than 242,000 posted a week earlier. It was the lowest since March 1973, the US Labor Department said, and the 104th week in a row that claims were below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a healthy labour market. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, is hoping to snap up Agent Provocateur. The upmarket lingerie is expected to enter administration on Thursday with Sports Direct the favourite to buy the business out of insolvency proceedings. Sky News reported earlier this week that Ashley had gone higher than private equity firm Lion Capital in a bidding war. Agent Provocateur is owned by private equity firm 3i but the brand has struggled in recent years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00a339m last year to reflect its problems and accounting irregularities were also uncovered. Read our full story here: A \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit is one of the biggest threats facing the Irish economy according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Another is the prospect of US corporate tax reforms. Moody\u2019s stresses however that Ireland\u2019s growth prospects remain strong. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u2019s senior vice president and author of the report explains on the risks posed by Brexit: Ireland has been growing strongly since 2014 and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming years. But the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential. And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform: There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u2019s foreign direct investment-focused economic model. The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u2019s economic success and Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u2019s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u2019s public finances would also be negatively affected. Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. February\u2019s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u2019s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. The pick-up entirely reflected higher energy and food inflation while the core rate was unchanged at just 0.9%. Florian Hense, economist at the German bank Berenberg, agrees, and suggests the European Central Bank will not feel the need to tighten policy at next week\u2019s meeting: The ECB will not have to rethink the thrust of its policies. The ECB will be very cautious not to make the same mistake it did in 2011 when it ended up hiking rates in April and July, just a few months before the Euro crisis erupted. Would you be happy to travel in a driverless car? The Guardian\u2019s Gwyn Topham took a spin around East London in a self-driving electric Nissan Leaf. Here\u2019s what happened: And the story in full: Moving over to Greece now, where the main opposition leader says the government is deliberately drawing out negotiations with creditors and preparing the country for a fourth bailout. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Seven years after it was granted its first emergency loan programme, Greece is being prepared for a fourth bailout, says Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who heads the main opposition centre right New Democracy party. In a wide ranging interview aired on Ant 1 TV on Wednesday night, the politician said prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 acceptance of further pension cuts and tax reforms was tantamount to a new adjustment programme that New Democracy would not be backing. This government cannot get the country out of the impasse it is in. We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u2019t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor. Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago. The government is consciously delaying [it] for reasons of domestic consumption. There is a big danger that entry into the [ECB\u2019s] quantitative easing [programme] will be missed. The spectre of yet more cuts has caused rising alarm in Greece with pensioners taking to the streets. It comes as the Cologne Institute for Economic research says poverty in Greece has shot up by 40 % between 2008 and 2015. \u201cGreece is the big loser,\u201d the think tank said in its latest study on the European economy, pointing out that the increase was the biggest among EU member states. President Trump is awake and tweeting about his impact on markets: The weak spots in the construction PMI survey have helped to push the pound to a six-week low against the dollar. Sterling fell 0.25% to $1.2259 against a broadly stronger dollar. It also hit a two-week low against the euro, with one euro worth 85.90p. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said the outlook for the pound was very much dependent on how quickly Theresa May can push ahead with Brexit plans. If she can trigger Brexit as per her deadline, it may push sterling even lower as this will send the message that Theresa May is in full control and her hard Brexit is taking shape. On the flip side, if she cannot deliver this on time, this could be a positive thing for sterling, and the currency could rally all the way to $1.28, with a potential target of $1.30 a realistic target as well. Earlier the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI suggested activity in the sector grew in February at a similar pace to January. The headline index edged up to 52.5 from 52.2, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Civil engineers reported an acceleration in growth, while growth in housing construction slowed slightly. Construction of commercial buildings such as offices and shops slowed. Firms were fairly upbeat according to Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, but there were reports of weakening demand: February\u2019s survey data highlights that the UK construction sector has rebounded from its post- referendum soft patch but remains on a relatively slow growth trajectory. Weaker momentum in the house building sector was a key factor weighing on construction growth, alongside a renewed fall in work commercial projects. There was little sign that the UK storms had a material impact on construction growth in February, although some firms noted that longer delivery times for roof tiles had added to supply chain issues. Instead, survey respondents mainly cited an underlying slowdown in sales growth, with the latest rise in new work the weakest for four months. Cost pressures in the sector remained at an eight-and-a-half year high, as the sharp drop in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of materials and goods imported from abroad. The eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.6% - the lowest since May 2009. There were 15.2 million unemployed people in the region, down 56,000 compared with December. Greece has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone at 23%, while Germany has the lowest at 3.8%. Youth unemployment also fell in January, by 198,000 compared with a year earlier to 2.8 million. The youth unemployment rate remains high at 20%. The highest rate is 45.7% in Greece, and the lowest is 6.5% in Germany. The headline rate of inflation in the eurozone rose to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, bang in line with expectations. Eurostat, the region\u2019s statistics office, said energy prices, food, alcohol and tobacco were the main drivers of the rise. Shares in the outsourcing group Capita are down 9% after the company revealed a 33% fall in annual profits and said its chief executive Andy Parker was stepping down. It follows confirmation that the company, which operates the London congestion charge, is to be relegated from the FTSE 100 because of a sharp fall in the share price. Parker commented on his departure: 2016 has been a difficult year for Capita but the Company is now a simpler, more focussed group with a clear service offering and growth strategy, and a plan to achieve a stronger balance sheet. We have achieved a great deal but going forward it is time for a new leader to take Capita through the next steps to renewed and sustainable organic growth. If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic following the news that the Football Pools is being sold for \u00a383m, below is a potted history of the former British staple. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, the pools had 15 million regular punters, helped by an army of door-to-door coupon collectors. The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime, is about to change hands in an \u00a383m deal. Its owner, London-listed betting company Sportech, has agreed to sell the football lottery game to a company controlled by funds advised by European private equity investors OpCapita. The conditional sale agreement comes after a near-\u00a3100m sale of the Football Pools to its management team fell through in November. The Football Pools dates back to 1923 and has struggled against the National Lottery, but is still popular with about 300,000 stalwarts who spend an average of just over \u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum price of \u00a33m. The business was formed from the merger of the three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters between 2000 and 2007. The pools will still move into new premises in Liverpool city centre. John Von Spreckelsen, chairman of OpCapita: We are delighted to be acquiring the Football Pools, which occupies a unique place in British culture. Sportech has successfully modernised the business and we look forward to realising its significant growth potential. As part of that growth strategy, we plan to ensure existing loyal customers continue to enjoy the game and bring the Football Pools, already loved by so many, to an even wider audience. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst, at ETX Capital, says Snap\u2019s debut in New York coincides with a period of bullishness among investors: Snap shares look set to fly when they begin trading in New York today after being priced at $17, above its target range. With the Dow closing above 21,000 for the first time the IPO comes at an incredibly bullish point for US, and indeed global, equities. Of course such bullishness is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble and this could be a high watermark for the market. The offer was 10 times over-subscribed, making a strong case for the stock to pop on the open. Big institutional funds will step in to the main market to add to their holdings, forcing up the price. Lessons to be learned from Facebook\u2019s IPO? We\u2019ve also seen huge retail client interest in Snap shares \u2013 this is as big as the Facebook IPO in terms of the hype and buzz around it. But trading in Snap shares could be choppy today. It could be pricing high and selling low. Facebook again is instructive \u2013 it endured a rocky start to life on the public markets, sliding from its IPO price before turning things around. Of course its IPO was beset by technical problems that the US exchanges are keen to avoid this time. There is also a sense that the shares could be overpriced, based on some key fundamentals. Shares in Snap, the American technology company behind the messaging app Snapchat, will start trading in New York today. Shares are expected to soar after it raised $3.4bn (\u00a32.9bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, above its price expectations. Snap\u2019s IPO was over-subscribed by more than 10 times, suggesting demand for shares will be strong when trading gets underway. Reuters notes: After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, the owner of the popular disappearing-message app has a market value of roughly $24 billion, more than double the size of rival Twitter Inc and the richest valuation in a US tech IPO since Facebook five years ago. The share sale was the first test of investor appetite for a social-media app that is beloved by teenagers and people under 30 for applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies, but has yet to convert \u201ccool\u201d into cash. The FTSE 100 might only be up 4 points or 0.1% at 7,387 but it\u2019s a new record high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are on a high following Trump\u2019s spending pledges despite the fact the President has yet to provide any detail. Equities analysts and strategists including myself have been arguing for some time that if no further details were provided on how and when the proposed US tax reforms and spending plans will take place, the market rally should take a pause. However, US President Donald Trump provided no new details in his speech to Congress on Tuesday, and yet, stocks surged to new highs. He also points out that rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month are also driving shares higher... usually such expectations would have the opposite effect as investors remain hooked on stimulus as the hangover from the financial crisis persists. Sayed says: What\u2019s even more interesting is markets now consider a tighter monetary policy a sign of confidence in economic growth and thus a reason to continue purchasing stocks, when for years post 2008 crisis it had been considered the most significant motive to dump stocks. Does the market rally have legs? There\u2019s no doubt that improved economic conditions, consumer confidence, and higher inflation will all lead to higher earnings growth, but what markets are currently pricing in is more than just these factors. It\u2019s mainly about tax reforms, and assuming a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax from 35% to 20%, although difficult to calculate its impact on earnings, is expected to lift net profits from 10% to 15%, and this is what investors are betting on. If you still want to ride the current bullish momentum wave, pray that Trump\u2019s tax reduction plan succeeds as soon as possible. The spotlight is on key elections coming up in Europe and all bets are off following Britain\u2019s shock Brexit vote and America\u2019s decision to install Donald Trump in the White House. Could the Netherlands deliver the next surprise? Here is a useful guide to the Dutch elections on 15 March: As markets settle following a record-breaking run, investors await the flash eurozone inflation rate for February, to be published at 10am. If economists polled by Reuters get it right, and the headline rate rises to 2% from 1.8% in January, Mario Draghi is likely to come under renewed pressure over the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures. Specifically, pressure could build on the president of the ECB to announce policy tightening at next week\u2019s meeting of the governing council. We\u2019ll bring you the figure and reaction when it comes. The FTSE 100 is up slightly this morning, rising 0.1% or four points to 7,387. Elsewhere in Europe major markets are up with the exception of Spain. German\u2019s DAX: +0.03% at 12,071 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 4,9781 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.01% at 19,367 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.04% at 9,748 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 376 The FTSE 250, which is more domestically focused on the UK than the FTSE 100, is down 0.1% at 18,961. Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning today. In a pretty gloomy report on poverty, inequality, and living standards, the thinktank says household incomes will not grow at all over the next two years. On average, by 2021-22, families will be \u00a35,000 a year worse off than they might have reasonably expected back in 2007-08 before the financial crisis took hold. Inequality and child poverty are also expected to rise over the next five years as a direct result of government policies. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at IFS, explains: Weak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts means that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021\u201322 as it was back in 2007\u201308. In the decade before that, it fell by a third. Tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament explain all of the projected increase in absolute child poverty between 2014\u201315 and 2021\u201322. A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the report: We are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the National Living Wage \u2013 a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this Parliament. Here is our full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u2019s pledge to go on a major spending spree drove a surge in investor optimism, pushing indices on both sides of the Atlantic to fresh record highs on Wednesday. Asia followed Wall Street higher this morning with the Hang Seng and Nikkei both just about in positive territory. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson has this take on investor mood: Records tumbled one after the other yesterday as equity markets across the world went on a tear in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to spend up to $1trn on rebuilding the infrastructure of the United States, with the FTSE100 and FTSE250 both making an closing at new record highs, as the reflation trade took another leg higher. US markets also surged with the Dow opening above 21,000 and the S&amp;P500 also hitting new record highs above 2,400, as markets posted their best one day gain of 2017. Also coming up day we have the flash estimate of eurozone inflation which is expected to show a pick up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, potentially causing problems for Mario Draghi. We also have eurozone unemployment. In the UK we have the latest snapshot of construction from the PMI survey for February. And over in the US we have weekly jobless claims figures. We will be bringing you all the latest developments as the day unfolds.",

The all-time high crude stockpile levels in the US is the number one reason behind oil\u2019s inability to move further higher in recent weeks. With net long positions on both contracts being at record high levels, it could be that money managers and other large speculators are beginning to unwind those positions, providing additional pressure on prices. The latest positioning data from the CFTC tonight and ICE on Monday may reflect this view point. Also, the fact that there were no further cuts in Russian oil production in February means it will take a little bit longer for the global oversupply to drain.</p> <p>Essentially though, the long-term bearish trend has ended and I still think prices will break further higher later on this year as evidence of a tighter oil market emerges. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T13:46:14.636Z\">at 1.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b9606fe4b047c20d904f5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T12:28:43.812Z\">12.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Weakness in the pound after the dip in UK service sector growth has done little to prop up the FTSE 100.</strong></p> <p>Normally a dip in sterling would boost the leading index due to its preponderance of overseas earners, but it is currently down 0.22% at 7366.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decline in the services PMI to a five-month low in February is the clearest sign yet that the U.K. now is enduring stagflation.</p> <p>The business activity index is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in output in the non-distribution private services sector slowing to around 0.2% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Granted, the PMI often is influenced excessively by sentiment and it was far too downbeat immediately after the referendum. But the recent rally in equity prices should have boosted corporate confidence. In addition, the services PMI was too downbeat last year because it excludes the retail sector, which benefited from a surge in consumer spending. Evidence on retail spending so far this year has been disappointingly weak. </p> <p>The services sector looks vulnerable to slowing sharply over the coming months now that businesses are rising prices rapidly. Indeed, the output prices balance rose to 54.1 in February\u2014its highest level since September 2008\u2014from 53.7 in January. In the past, the business activity index has tended to weaken over the following six months whenever the output prices index has exceeded 52. Accordingly, we continue to expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth to average just 0.2% this year, ensuring that the MPC holds back from raising interest rates despite high inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b94627e4b07c254ae21b72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:41:02.470Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the PMI data confirms the country\u2019s economy is likely to see slower growth this year, according to Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bigger than expected fall in the services PMI adds to the mounting evidence in recent weeks that the UK economy is slowing. It fits with the recent fall in retail sales amid a squeeze in real household income growth. We continue to expect growth to slow this year and for the UK economy to decouple from firming global economic activity...</p> <p>The weaker headline figure, which refers to output/business activity, was also reflected in the detail of the report. The new orders balance fell 1.3pts. to 54.7, and both backlogs-of-work and future business expectations edged down. Set against this, the employment balance rose.</p> <p>There are two salient explanations for the recent softness. First, the squeeze in real household income growth (resulting from higher imported inflation) is weighing on demand, particularly for retail services...</p> <p>Second, Brexit-related economic uncertainty remains high and this will increasingly weigh on business investment as the date when the UK formally leaves the EU (spring 2019) approaches.</p> <p>The composite PMI... fell to 53.6 in February, down from an average of 55.4 in the final quarter of last year. The sectorial breakdown clearly reveals that the weakness in the UK economy is domestic, with the export-oriented manufacturing sector performing relatively well and supported by the past depreciation of sterling and firming global economic activity (particularly in Europe). Based on the historical relationship between the composite PMI and real GDP growth, the PMIs in February would be consistent with a quarterly real GDP growth rate of around 0.3%-0.4% quarter on quarter. We keep our forecast for first quarter 2017 real GDP growth of 0.3% quarter on quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b9452ce4b09c1763ef5afc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:31:37.239Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite weak eurozone retail sales figures, shopkeepers remain optimistic about the outlook, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not all that glitters is gold as strong Eurozone economic surveys mask weak performance in retail at the start of the year. The outlook for domestic demand does remain positive though, even under higher inflation rates.</p> <p>While surveys about the Eurozone economy in 2017 have been very upbeat so far, retail sales disappointed in January. The 0.1% month on month decline is the third in a row, while year on year growth is just 1.2%. This suggests that recent Eurozone optimism is not translating into more shopping at the moment.</p> <p>One factor probably influencing this is the rebound of inflation in recent months, bringing price growth back to 2% in the Eurozone. Nominal wage growth has been below 2% since 2013, indicating that real wages are suffering from the recent rebound in prices.</p> <p>Retailers confirmed the current weakness in demand in the Economic Sentiment Indicator as the February survey showed a strong decline in the assessment of the present business situation.</p> <p>Even though recent months have disappointed, retailers do remain optimistic about business in the months ahead. This probably makes sense, given the strength in the job market and relative optimism among consumers.</p> <p>Today\u2019s composite PMI numbers confirm that strength in the economy. Still though, this could be a sign for Eurozone growth that domestic demand could be impacted by declining real wages, although we expect consumer spending to remain robust in the first quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:37:32.964Z\">at 10.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b93eeee4b047c20d904ea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T10:12:12.168Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone retail sales slip</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eurozone may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/mar/03/markets-edge-lower-ahead-of-service-sector-figures-business-live?page=with:block-58b9318ee4b047c20d904e66#block-58b9318ee4b047c20d904e66\">starting to fire on all cylinders</a> according to the PMIs, but the region\u2019s shopkeepers may not agree.</p> <p>Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in January, the third fall in a row and contradicting expectations of a 0.4% increase.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After effectively sitting out Thursday, the European markets decided to give back some of the week\u2019s rapid growth this morning.</p> <p>Shedding 25 points after the bell, the FTSE started Friday holding above 7350. A smattering of red in its mining sector, and perhaps just a bit of doubt about just how high the index currently sits, seemed responsible for the FTSE\u2019s fall. The pound saw similar losses, slipping to a fresh 6 week nadir against the dollar while handing 0.2% in value back to the euro. </p> <p>Sentiment could shift, however, dependant on the state of the latest services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to dip from 54.5 to 54.2 month-on-month, though this week those estimates haven\u2019t been very accurate, with the manufacturing and construction PMIs under- and out-performing forecasts respectively. If the services reading can avoid a February dip then the pound may be lifted away from its current lows; if not than sterling\u2019s decline may well intensify.</p> <p>Like in the UK, the Eurozone indices looked a bit weary this morning. The DAX slid 0.4% thanks to a sharp drop in German retail sales, though the index managed to cling on above 12000, while the CAC fell back towards 4950 with a 0.1% decline. The region\u2019s services data is expectedly to be relatively strong, with the Eurozone-wide figure set to be confirmed at 55.6 for February compared to 53.7 in January, hitting a 6-ish year high in the process.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T08:41:22.936Z\">at 8.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b92397e4b09c1763ef5a80\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T08:07:47.431Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As forecast, investors are pausing for breath again after the recent record breaking run in shares.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.27|% to 7362, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.5%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.3% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.41%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.5%.</p> <p>And Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has opened 0.3% lower.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b9201ce4b07c254ae21aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-03T07:56:52.885Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The London Stock Exchange, currently in the throes of a merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, has reported a 21% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3623m, in line with expectations.

                "bodyText":"Unlike the Markit survey, the latest Institute for Supply Management report shows stronger than expected growth in the service sector. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.6 in February, up from 56.5 in January and better than the forecasts of 56.5. This is the highest level since October 2015. At 61.2, up from 58.6 in January, the new orders index is at its best since August 2015. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. The first of two surveys of the US service sector has come in marginally below expectations and lower than the previous month. The Markit services PMI for February fell from 55.6 in January to 53.8, below the initial estimate of 53.9. The composite index was 54.1, down from the first reading of 54.3 and the January figure of 55.8. US markets have made an uncertain start to trading after Thursday\u2019s falls. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 25 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.07% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.11%. Meanwhile, at the start of the second day of its life as a public company, Snapchat owner Snap followed its 44% first day rise by climbing another 8.8%. It was helped by news that NBC Universal said it had invested $500m in Snap at the flotation. But analysts at Pivotal Research were negative on the company, putting a $10 price target on the shares: Snap is a promising early stage company with significant opportunity ahead of itself. Unfortunately, it is significantly overvalued given the likely scale of its long-term opportunity and the risks associated with executing against that opportunity. Significant ongoing dilution from share-based compensation will likely represent an additional negative consideration for the stock. We value Snap at $10 per share on a 2017 basis. As the stock priced well above this level in its IPO, we rate its shares sell. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras appears positive about the current talks with creditors: Over to Greece where politicians, economists and policy makers have been discussing the county\u2019s outlook at the annual Delphi Economic Forum. Our correspondent Helena Smith caught up with Greece\u2019s Tourism chief there: Tourism, Greece\u2019s great economic engine, is about to sputter into action, with a new record that will finally help generate growth. Speaking to the Guardian on the sidelines of the Delphi Economic Forum, Greece\u2019s Tourism chief Andreas Andreadis said figures released by airport authorities showed an extra 1.5 million airline seats were planned this year. \u201cWith the expected increase in seat occupancy we will see around two million more arrivals with around 200,000 of that number from the UK. This time, last year, we were in the midst of the refugee crisis and Spain was the big winner. Now Greece is the big winner.\u201d The boost will bring in an anticipated \u20ac1bn in extra revenues which would grow GDP by about one percent, he said. Last year sector revenues had declined despite the evident rise in arrivals with visitors spending much less per capita. \u201cThis will be another record year but, more importantly, it will be a year when real growth will start and tourism will be the main reason,\u201d Andreadis added insisting that what Greece most needed was a ten-year growth plan and a roadmap to implement it. \u201cThe memoranda,\u201d he said referring to the terms and conditions attached to the three bailouts Athens has received since 2010, \u201cwill not lead us out of crisis. What we need is vision and a roadmap to implement it.\u201d Gold is set for its biggest weekly fall for nearly four months on the growing prospect of a US rate rise in March. The precious metal is priced in dollars and so is sensitive to increases in the US currency. It is currently down $5 an ounce at $1,229. But oil has edged higher, recovering a little from recent falls on concerns about whether Russia would cut production in line with a recent deal among producers. Brent crude is up 0.47% at $55.34 a barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Both oil contracts have bounced back a little after Thursday\u2019s sharp plunge. The all-time high crude stockpile levels in the US is the number one reason behind oil\u2019s inability to move further higher in recent weeks. With net long positions on both contracts being at record high levels, it could be that money managers and other large speculators are beginning to unwind those positions, providing additional pressure on prices. The latest positioning data from the CFTC tonight and ICE on Monday may reflect this view point. Also, the fact that there were no further cuts in Russian oil production in February means it will take a little bit longer for the global oversupply to drain. Essentially though, the long-term bearish trend has ended and I still think prices will break further higher later on this year as evidence of a tighter oil market emerges. Weakness in the pound after the dip in UK service sector growth has done little to prop up the FTSE 100. Normally a dip in sterling would boost the leading index due to its preponderance of overseas earners, but it is currently down 0.22% at 7366. The pound is 0.34% lower at $1.2224 against the dollar - having earlier dropped to $1.2215 - and down 0.67% against the euro at \u20ac1.1594. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Part of the reason sterling\u2019s slide against the euro was so aggressive was that the Eurozone\u2019s own services PMI hit a near 6 year peak of 55.5 (a smidge lower than what was forecast). This prevented the DAX from getting out of the red, the German index shedding 30 points; the CAC, however, managed to rise 0.5% thanks to the most recent French election polls placing Emmanuel Macron ahead of Marine Le Pen in the first round of voting. After Snap\u2019s jet-fuelled stock market debut on Thursday - a 44% surge which values the Snapchat owner at $28bn - the company\u2019s shares are being indicated higher again. The future market is currently showing a 1.3% rise to $24.80, but now the company is listed it has to prove itself, say analysts. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Snap duly delivered on the hype that surrounded its IPO, with a 44% gain in the share price on day one echoing the heady days of the dot-com bubble. The underwriters and company management will be pleased to see the stock in such high demand, but the easy work is now behind it. Snap is now just another company on the New York stock exchange, and will be judged by the same metrics as others of its ilk. It has to show real user growth from this point onwards, and a firm strategy for making money off those users. And Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, warned: For a company that is losing almost half a billion dollars a year, may never be profitable and faces aggressive competition from larger peers, this valuation seems stratospheric. The reason is the company\u2019s popularity with teenagers and millennials, who are prized targets for advertisers. However, this industry remains extremely fickle (remember MySpace and Friends Reunited?) and many investors piling in not wishing to miss \u201cthe next big thing\u201d are unlikely to have used the app themselves. Investors tend not to be teenagers. Warren Buffett says he will never invest in a business he doesn\u2019t understand, this may be advice well worth heeding for those tempted to take a nibble of Snap. Over in Greece, the country\u2019s prime minister tweets: The UK is entering stagflation - high inflation and stagnant growth - warns Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: The decline in the services PMI to a five-month low in February is the clearest sign yet that the U.K. now is enduring stagflation. The business activity index is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in output in the non-distribution private services sector slowing to around 0.2% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Granted, the PMI often is influenced excessively by sentiment and it was far too downbeat immediately after the referendum. But the recent rally in equity prices should have boosted corporate confidence. In addition, the services PMI was too downbeat last year because it excludes the retail sector, which benefited from a surge in consumer spending. Evidence on retail spending so far this year has been disappointingly weak. The services sector looks vulnerable to slowing sharply over the coming months now that businesses are rising prices rapidly. Indeed, the output prices balance rose to 54.1 in February\u2014its highest level since September 2008\u2014from 53.7 in January. In the past, the business activity index has tended to weaken over the following six months whenever the output prices index has exceeded 52. Accordingly, we continue to expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth to average just 0.2% this year, ensuring that the MPC holds back from raising interest rates despite high inflation. Back with the UK, and the PMI data confirms the country\u2019s economy is likely to see slower growth this year, according to Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research. He said: The bigger than expected fall in the services PMI adds to the mounting evidence in recent weeks that the UK economy is slowing. It fits with the recent fall in retail sales amid a squeeze in real household income growth. We continue to expect growth to slow this year and for the UK economy to decouple from firming global economic activity... The weaker headline figure, which refers to output/business activity, was also reflected in the detail of the report. The new orders balance fell 1.3pts. to 54.7, and both backlogs-of-work and future business expectations edged down. Set against this, the employment balance rose. There are two salient explanations for the recent softness. First, the squeeze in real household income growth (resulting from higher imported inflation) is weighing on demand, particularly for retail services... Second, Brexit-related economic uncertainty remains high and this will increasingly weigh on business investment as the date when the UK formally leaves the EU (spring 2019) approaches. The composite PMI... fell to 53.6 in February, down from an average of 55.4 in the final quarter of last year. The sectorial breakdown clearly reveals that the weakness in the UK economy is domestic, with the export-oriented manufacturing sector performing relatively well and supported by the past depreciation of sterling and firming global economic activity (particularly in Europe). Based on the historical relationship between the composite PMI and real GDP growth, the PMIs in February would be consistent with a quarterly real GDP growth rate of around 0.3%-0.4% quarter on quarter. We keep our forecast for first quarter 2017 real GDP growth of 0.3% quarter on quarter. Despite weak eurozone retail sales figures, shopkeepers remain optimistic about the outlook, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Not all that glitters is gold as strong Eurozone economic surveys mask weak performance in retail at the start of the year. The outlook for domestic demand does remain positive though, even under higher inflation rates. While surveys about the Eurozone economy in 2017 have been very upbeat so far, retail sales disappointed in January. The 0.1% month on month decline is the third in a row, while year on year growth is just 1.2%. This suggests that recent Eurozone optimism is not translating into more shopping at the moment. One factor probably influencing this is the rebound of inflation in recent months, bringing price growth back to 2% in the Eurozone. Nominal wage growth has been below 2% since 2013, indicating that real wages are suffering from the recent rebound in prices. Retailers confirmed the current weakness in demand in the Economic Sentiment Indicator as the February survey showed a strong decline in the assessment of the present business situation. Even though recent months have disappointed, retailers do remain optimistic about business in the months ahead. This probably makes sense, given the strength in the job market and relative optimism among consumers. Today\u2019s composite PMI numbers confirm that strength in the economy. Still though, this could be a sign for Eurozone growth that domestic demand could be impacted by declining real wages, although we expect consumer spending to remain robust in the first quarter. The eurozone may be starting to fire on all cylinders according to the PMIs, but the region\u2019s shopkeepers may not agree. Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.1% month on month in January, the third fall in a row and contradicting expectations of a 0.4% increase. The year on year figure was a rise of 1.2% but this was lower than the forecast 1.6% increase. The December figure was revised down from a 0.3% fall to one of 0.5% despite the supposed boost from Christmas shoppers. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The pace of growth in the UK services sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of GDP, slipped slightly in February according to survey data released today... 2017 looks set to be a relatively challenging year for the economy, with higher inflation and weaker pay growth likely to squeeze household budgets. This means consumer spending could slow in real terms. Today\u2019s figure, along with the equivalent readings for the manufacturing and construction sectors, point to 0.4% GDP growth in the first quarter. Overall, however, the economic picture remains more positive than many expected after last year\u2019s vote to leave the EU. A PMI reading above 50 shows the sector is still expanding, albeit at its slowest pace since September. The survey showed that business confidence remained strong, and sentiment about the rest of the year was largely positive. Nevertheless, with uncertainty still rife over how and when the UK will actually leave the EU, and survey data pointing to a modest slowing of activity, the Bank of England looks most unlikely to consider raising interest rates in the near to medium term. The pound slipped back to a day\u2019s low of $1.2227 against the dollar immediately after the PMI figures, with analysts suggesting the weakness in the economy was more likely to lead to lower interest rates for longer. This is a seven week low against the US currency, while the pound has also fallen against the euro, down 0.5% to \u20ac1.1617. Chris Williamson, chief business economist of survey compiler Markit, said: Weaker consumer spending was a key cause of slower service sector growth, suggesting that household budgets are starting to crack under the strain of higher prices and weak wage growth. The ongoing steep upturn in costs suggest that consumer price inflation has significantly further to rise, adding to our belief that inflation will breach 3% over the course of the next year. Despite this, Williamson said the PMI data was more consistent with further easing by the Bank of England. He said: The slowdown in the pace of economic growth signalled by the February surveys pushes the PMI back towards territory more indicative of additional policy stimulus from the Bank of England than a tightening. The UK\u2019s service sector grew more slowly than expected in February, mainly due to a slowdown in consumer spending. The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers index fell from 54.5 in January to 53.3, its weakest performance since last September and lower than the 54.2 figure expected by economists. Markit said the figures - along with the earlier manufacturing and construction data - suggested first quarter growth of below 0.4% compared with 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The data comes ahead of this month\u2019s Budget and ahead of the government\u2019s plan to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the European Union. The positive figures from the eurozone may not last, according to Howard Archer, chief european and UK economist at IHS Markit. He said: The final purchasing managers\u2019 survey confirmed Eurozone services activity really stepped up a gear in February to be at a 69-month high. Significantly and encouragingly, It was not only business activity that saw a long-term high, but also incoming new business, outstanding business and business expectations. Employment growth also accelerated. Furthermore, with Eurozone manufacturing expansion picking up modestly further to a 70-month high, Markit report that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output in February was at the best level since April 2011. The markedly overall improved February purchasing managers\u2019 surveys indicate that the Eurozone economy is seeing a robust first quarter of 2017 after solid if unspectacular growth in the second half of 2016. However, we suspect the Eurozone may find it difficult to kick on amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation and limited wage growth in most countries. A dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in February fuels this suspicion. Consequently, we suspect that Eurozone GDP growth will be 1.6%. The positive mood continues with news that eurozone businesses grew at their fastest rate since April 2011. The Markit composite index - manufacturing and services - rose to 56 in February from 54.4 the previous month. The service sector index itself climbed from 53.7 in January to 55.5. Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said: The final PMI numbers paint a bright picture of a eurozone economy starting to fire on all cylinders. Growth accelerated in all of the four largest member states in February to suggest an increasingly sustainable and robust-looking upturn. The broad-based improvement has pushed the eurozone PMI into territory consistent with 0.6% GDP growth in the first quarter. The labour market is also starting to boom, with jobs being created at the fastest rate for nearly a decade. The strength of the eurozone economy could give the European Central Bank pause for thought in its current quantitive easing and low interest rate programmes: Any change to the ECB\u2019s policy would go down well in Germany, which has been upset by the negative effect of low interest rates on the country\u2019s savers. And making a hat-trick of positive performances, Germany service sector has also improved in February after hitting a four month low at the start of the year. Markit\u2019s services PMI for the country rose from 53.4 in January to 54.4, while the composite index climbed from 54.8 to a 34 month high of 56.1 in February. Markit economist Trevor Balchin said: The latest PMI data add to our expectations that economic growth will strengthen in the first quarter to at least 0.6% quarter on quarter, marking a strong start to 2017. The French service sector also put in a strong performance last month, with its fastest pace of expansion since May 2011. IHS Markit said its services PMI index came in at 56.4 in February, up from 54.1 the previous month but slightly lower than the initial estimate of 56.7. The composite index of services and manufacturing rose to 55.9 from 54.1. The sector was boosted by a recovery in the hotel and restaurant business which had previously suffered after a fall in tourism. And strongly out of the traps is Italy, which has just reported its strongest service sector growth since December 2015. The Markit business activity index for services companies jumped from 52.4 in January to 54.1 last month, well above the 53.1 expected by analysts. This follows a positive performance in the manufacturing survey released on Wednesday, helping lift the composite index for both sectors from 52.8 to 54.8. The figures make good reading for prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has been in the post for almost three months. WPP is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down nearly 6% after it lowered its growth forecast for the year. WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell also had things to say about corporate governance: WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell has said that companies with dominant shareholders or owners such as Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox, Facebook and Snap that \u201coffend\u201d good corporate governance practices take more risks and tend to perform better financially. Sorrell was speaking the day after Snapchat parent Snap floated on Wall Street, with the offering oversubscribed and the share price rising more than 44% to $24 on its first day of trading, despite co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy and early investors keeping total control of voting rights. He said that WPP has found over a decade of measuring brand valuations that when markets hit tough patches it is companies with dominant shareholders or owners that tend to continue to invest perform best. The full story is here: The dip in markets so far could be reversed if the service sector figures look reasonable, suggests Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. He said: After effectively sitting out Thursday, the European markets decided to give back some of the week\u2019s rapid growth this morning. Shedding 25 points after the bell, the FTSE started Friday holding above 7350. A smattering of red in its mining sector, and perhaps just a bit of doubt about just how high the index currently sits, seemed responsible for the FTSE\u2019s fall. The pound saw similar losses, slipping to a fresh 6 week nadir against the dollar while handing 0.2% in value back to the euro. Sentiment could shift, however, dependant on the state of the latest services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to dip from 54.5 to 54.2 month-on-month, though this week those estimates haven\u2019t been very accurate, with the manufacturing and construction PMIs under- and out-performing forecasts respectively. If the services reading can avoid a February dip then the pound may be lifted away from its current lows; if not than sterling\u2019s decline may well intensify. Like in the UK, the Eurozone indices looked a bit weary this morning. The DAX slid 0.4% thanks to a sharp drop in German retail sales, though the index managed to cling on above 12000, while the CAC fell back towards 4950 with a 0.1% decline. The region\u2019s services data is expectedly to be relatively strong, with the Eurozone-wide figure set to be confirmed at 55.6 for February compared to 53.7 in January, hitting a 6-ish year high in the process. As forecast, investors are pausing for breath again after the recent record breaking run in shares. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.27|% to 7362, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.5%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.3% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.41%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.5%. And Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has opened 0.3% lower. The London Stock Exchange, currently in the throes of a merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, has reported a 21% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3623m, in line with expectations. The dividend is higher than expected at 43.2p a share rather than 38p, which the LSE says reflects a strong outlook. Earlier in the week, the LSE suggested that a last minute demand from Brussels to sell its 60% share in Italian business MTS could scupper the \u00a324bn deal. But there was no mention of this in today\u2019s statement. Numis analyst Jonathan Goslin said: There is little new revealed in the outlook statement. The company still claims: \u201cThe Group continues to work hard on its proposed merger with Deutsche Bo\u0308rse AG - awaiting outcome of the European Commission Phase II process on or before 3 April 2017\u201d. We continue to favour [the LSE\u2019s] strong market position, favourable growth drivers and diversified revenue base. However, the shares are up with events in our view, especially given the downside risks should a deal with Deutsche B\u00f6rse not eventually be completed. Ahead of the splurge of service sector data, we have already had some disappointing German retail sales figures. They fell 0.8% month on month in January, compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise and an unchanged figure the previous month. But the year on year figure showed a 2.3% increase compared to a 0.4% rise in December. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a bit like Groundhog Day. On Tuesday there was a whole host of manufacturing data from around the globe - mostly showing a positive trend - and now we get the same thing but for the service sector. Things have kicked off with a slightly disappointing figure from China. The Caixin services PMI index slipped from 53.1 in January to 52.6 last month, down from 18 month highs. Elsewhere, after some weakness in February\u2019s UK manufacturing figure and a pick up in the construction sector, the services index is expected to show a dip, from 54.5 in January to 54.2 as rising prices put a brake on consumer demand. As for Europe, Michael Hewson at CMC Markets sums up expectations: In Europe... the latest Spain, Italy, France and Germany services numbers [are all] expected to show significant improvements on their January numbers, with increases to 55.1, 53.1, 56.7 and 54.4 respectively. In the US, there is expected to be a strong performance from the service sector, which is likely to add fuel to the growing belief that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as this month\u2019s meeting. Hewson again: The US remains the key driver of markets right now and the sudden hawkish stance of a number of previously dovish Fed officials has caught investors somewhat off guard in the past week or so, and pushing the prospect that we\u2019ll see another interest rate rise into a realistic prospect. In fact such has been the turnaround in expectations, that a rate move looks more or less a done deal. Today\u2019s US ISM services numbers for February are expected to underscore this increased optimism with an expectation that we\u2019ll see a robust 56.5, however the acid test will be later today when a week of Fed speakers concludes with four more FOMC voting members speaking about the US economy. That expectation has been pushing the dollar higher again, and as a consequence putting pressure on the pound. As it happens, sterling is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2265 but has edged 0.15% lower against the euro to \u20ac1.1653. Meawhile after Thursday\u2019s fall on Wall Street following its record breaking run and overnight dips in Asia, European markets are expected to open lower: On the corporate front there are results out from advertising giant WPP and the London Stock Exchange.",

                "body":"<p>Is there anyone who thinks Snap Inc, the firm behind Snapchat, was justified in issuing shares with zero voting rights? To most minds, Snap\u2019s innovation undermined the whole concept of a shareholding carrying rights of ownership. If a shareholder can\u2019t vote on corporate resolutions, like the appointment of directors and auditors and the payment of dividends, they\u2019ve just bought a ticket to a show. They may still share in the company\u2019s economic success or failure, but shareholding is meant to be a wider idea.</p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell is the man with the case for defence. \u201cPerhaps surprisingly, corporate structures that seem to offend customary good corporate governance may deliver better long-term results,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/03/martin-sorrell-wpp-rupert-murdoch-fox-facebook-snap-forecast-2017\">declared the chief executive of advertising giant WPP </a>last week.</p> <p>Sorrell gave examples of the companies he had in mind. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox; Comcast, the US cable company with Brian Roberts at the helm; Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s creation, Facebook; and Sergey Brin and Larry Page\u2019s Google. Evan Spiegel at Snap, too, might \u201cprovide the confidence and stability needed to take the appropriate level of risk\u201d, said Sorrell.</p> <p>It\u2019s an impressive list, even if it is too early to tell if Snap \u2013 five years old and loss-making, despite its startling $28bn valuation in last week\u2019s flotation \u2013 is tomorrow\u2019s Facebook or just today\u2019s fad. But it is a list compiled without rigour. One could equally construct a line-up of horror stories involving companies with dominant shareholders and unconventional governance.</p> <p>Robert Maxwell\u2019s Mirror Group and Asil Nadir\u2019s Polly Peck were the great financial scandals of the early 1990s that prompted the City of London to get serious about good governance for the first time. In more recent years, the FTSE 100 index has seen ENRC, straight out of Kazakhstan and \u201cmore Soviet than City\u201d, according to one non-executive director who was ejected from the boardroom as the dominant shareholders asserted control. Or try Bumi, a Nat Rothschild mining creation that descended into shambles and infighting in Indonesia.</p> <p>The truth is that one could point to examples of both triumph and failure at \u201cunconventional\u201d companies.</p> <p>In a general sense, it\u2019s easy to understand that a dominant shareholder could be more willing to take a long-term view of investment. The classic example is Associated British Foods, a FTSE 100 firm but family controlled, which quietly turned its once-small retailing business into the phenomenon that is Primark. Then again, there\u2019s Sports Direct, where long-term investment seems to mean whatever takes Mike Ashley\u2019s fancy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/02/sports-direct-agent-provocateur-lingerie-mike-ashley\">Last week it was Agent Provocateur</a>; next week it could be anything.</p> <p>But the timing of Sorrell\u2019s remarks on the day after Snap\u2019s arrival on the New York Stock Exchange suggest something else: that he thinks disenfranchising shareholders is OK because it encourages risk-taking and creates more wealth for all. The argument could be summed up another way: chief executives should be accountable only to themselves, and the little folk should accept what\u2019s good for them.</p> <p>It\u2019s complete nonsense. It\u2019s a formula for crony capitalism in which insiders can do as they wish, and pay themselves what they want, regardless of outcomes. Such a system has no checks or balances. Shareholders\u2019 power to protest about how the assets are managed is swept under the carpet. Without votes, there is no power. It is the cult of the superman chief executive, whose judgment on the \u201cappropriate level of risk\u201d, as Sorrell puts it, must be trusted absolutely.</p> <p>It is extraordinary that the US \u2013 land of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d \u2013 has embraced shares with restricted or zero votes. A shareholding democracy offers imperfect protections against boardroom abuse, but turning the dial in the other direction is a recipe for trouble.</p> <p>Maybe Sorrell is jealous. He was paid \u00a370m last year but the sums will fall eventually because his long-term pay scheme had to be reined in after 60% of WPP shareholders voted against it in 2012. Life is much easier when shareholders are reduced to being members of a fan club.</p> <h2>PPI deadline will benefit only banks</h2> <p>Few things add up in the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. The first estimate of the scale of the problem was put at \u00a34.5bn. The first provision Lloyds Banking Group took in 2011 of \u00a33.2bn was intended to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the matter. The reality? The industry\u2019s bill has reached \u00a340bn and Lloyds\u2019s bill is a staggering \u00a317bn.</p> <p>It is little wonder there has been so much imprecision. There appear to have been too few real numbers about the number of policies sold and even fewer clues as to how many were mis-sold. PPI, after all, need not have been a scandal. Sold alongside loans and credit cards with a view to ensuring customers could keep up repayments after sudden loss of income (through illness, say) PPI should have provided a sensible safety net for customers.</p> <p>Except it didn\u2019t. Banks realised it was a moneyspinner. The Financial Conduct Authority has now disclosed that 64m PPI policies were sold to about 30m consumers between 1990 and 2010. Estimates vary as to how much cash it brought through the door. One from 2014 reckons banks received \u00a344bn in premiums from 45m policies. The FCA calculates that 13m claims have been made \u2013 a total which must rise, given the vast number of policies sold.</p> <p>Which is why it is alarming that the FCA has decided that enough is enough.

                "bodyText":"Is there anyone who thinks Snap Inc, the firm behind Snapchat, was justified in issuing shares with zero voting rights? To most minds, Snap\u2019s innovation undermined the whole concept of a shareholding carrying rights of ownership. If a shareholder can\u2019t vote on corporate resolutions, like the appointment of directors and auditors and the payment of dividends, they\u2019ve just bought a ticket to a show. They may still share in the company\u2019s economic success or failure, but shareholding is meant to be a wider idea. Sir Martin Sorrell is the man with the case for defence. \u201cPerhaps surprisingly, corporate structures that seem to offend customary good corporate governance may deliver better long-term results,\u201d declared the chief executive of advertising giant WPP last week. Sorrell gave examples of the companies he had in mind. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox; Comcast, the US cable company with Brian Roberts at the helm; Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s creation, Facebook; and Sergey Brin and Larry Page\u2019s Google. Evan Spiegel at Snap, too, might \u201cprovide the confidence and stability needed to take the appropriate level of risk\u201d, said Sorrell. It\u2019s an impressive list, even if it is too early to tell if Snap \u2013 five years old and loss-making, despite its startling $28bn valuation in last week\u2019s flotation \u2013 is tomorrow\u2019s Facebook or just today\u2019s fad. But it is a list compiled without rigour. One could equally construct a line-up of horror stories involving companies with dominant shareholders and unconventional governance. Robert Maxwell\u2019s Mirror Group and Asil Nadir\u2019s Polly Peck were the great financial scandals of the early 1990s that prompted the City of London to get serious about good governance for the first time. In more recent years, the FTSE 100 index has seen ENRC, straight out of Kazakhstan and \u201cmore Soviet than City\u201d, according to one non-executive director who was ejected from the boardroom as the dominant shareholders asserted control. Or try Bumi, a Nat Rothschild mining creation that descended into shambles and infighting in Indonesia. The truth is that one could point to examples of both triumph and failure at \u201cunconventional\u201d companies. In a general sense, it\u2019s easy to understand that a dominant shareholder could be more willing to take a long-term view of investment. The classic example is Associated British Foods, a FTSE 100 firm but family controlled, which quietly turned its once-small retailing business into the phenomenon that is Primark. Then again, there\u2019s Sports Direct, where long-term investment seems to mean whatever takes Mike Ashley\u2019s fancy. Last week it was Agent Provocateur; next week it could be anything. But the timing of Sorrell\u2019s remarks on the day after Snap\u2019s arrival on the New York Stock Exchange suggest something else: that he thinks disenfranchising shareholders is OK because it encourages risk-taking and creates more wealth for all. The argument could be summed up another way: chief executives should be accountable only to themselves, and the little folk should accept what\u2019s good for them. It\u2019s complete nonsense. It\u2019s a formula for crony capitalism in which insiders can do as they wish, and pay themselves what they want, regardless of outcomes. Such a system has no checks or balances. Shareholders\u2019 power to protest about how the assets are managed is swept under the carpet. Without votes, there is no power. It is the cult of the superman chief executive, whose judgment on the \u201cappropriate level of risk\u201d, as Sorrell puts it, must be trusted absolutely. It is extraordinary that the US \u2013 land of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d \u2013 has embraced shares with restricted or zero votes. A shareholding democracy offers imperfect protections against boardroom abuse, but turning the dial in the other direction is a recipe for trouble. Maybe Sorrell is jealous. He was paid \u00a370m last year but the sums will fall eventually because his long-term pay scheme had to be reined in after 60% of WPP shareholders voted against it in 2012. Life is much easier when shareholders are reduced to being members of a fan club. PPI deadline will benefit only banks Few things add up in the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. The first estimate of the scale of the problem was put at \u00a34.5bn. The first provision Lloyds Banking Group took in 2011 of \u00a33.2bn was intended to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the matter. The reality? The industry\u2019s bill has reached \u00a340bn and Lloyds\u2019s bill is a staggering \u00a317bn. It is little wonder there has been so much imprecision. There appear to have been too few real numbers about the number of policies sold and even fewer clues as to how many were mis-sold. PPI, after all, need not have been a scandal. Sold alongside loans and credit cards with a view to ensuring customers could keep up repayments after sudden loss of income (through illness, say) PPI should have provided a sensible safety net for customers. Except it didn\u2019t. Banks realised it was a moneyspinner. The Financial Conduct Authority has now disclosed that 64m PPI policies were sold to about 30m consumers between 1990 and 2010. Estimates vary as to how much cash it brought through the door. One from 2014 reckons banks received \u00a344bn in premiums from 45m policies. The FCA calculates that 13m claims have been made \u2013 a total which must rise, given the vast number of policies sold. Which is why it is alarming that the FCA has decided that enough is enough. As it announced a deadline of 29 August 2019 for claims, the City regulator said this would prompt the holdouts to take action. The decision to impose a deadline is far more likely to benefit the big banks than their customers. The industry\u2019s intransigence in paying out has spawned a vast claims industry: thousands of people are employed by banks to process claims in part fuelled by claims-management companies, which hassle on customers\u2019 behalf, and add to costs. MoneySavingExpert.com reckons that in half of all cases in the last 12 months where a PPI claim has been rejected by a bank but then taken to the independent ombudsman, the rejection had been overturned. Everything\u2019s relative for Hogg Read these words Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, uttered some characteristically choice words last week when he took evidence from Charlotte Hogg, a newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England. \u201cI have over the years got used to doing business with people who are the sons and daughters of people I used to work with.

But it\u2019s another two years till Brexit, which is a worry.\u201d Protecting a pension, he has paid in to for 28 years also concerns him. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since I was 19; I know nothing else.\u201d It is not only older workers who fear redundancy. James Upton, 26, says: \u201cMost places nowadays only want you for a few months. This is the one job that\u2019s actually stuck. Around here it\u2019s difficult. When you go to the jobcentre website and apply for stuff, nothing ever comes through.\u201d Joshua Taylor, 25, who has spent three years in the paint shop, found out about the PSA takeover on Facebook. He says: \u201cI looked up other plants Peugeot have bought and it doesn\u2019t look promising.\u201d Vauxhall has been at Luton since 1905. Gavin Shuker, Labour MP for Luton South and a lifelong resident, said its significance remains strong. \u201cMy dad worked here, and his father before him. That\u2019s not an uncommon story in Luton.\u201d Almost 1,500 people are directly employed at the factory, with 740 more in the head office and thousands more in the supply chain. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty vital for Luton,\u201d Shuker says, adding that the plant was \u201cone of the most productive and competitive part of GM\u2019s business\u201d, but Brexit had raised uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s the assurances we can\u2019t give that are the tricky ones. It\u2019s with Boris Johnson and Theresa May \u2013 that\u2019s where this story goes next,\u201d he says.",

The pay of WPP\u2019s Sorrell has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012 - during what became known as the shareholder spring - nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package for the previous year. It sparked changes to his pay deals which were generated by the leadership equity acquisition plan (Leap) which has payed out multi-million pound share deals for Sorrell. The latest \u00a341.6m payout is the last from the Leap scheme, which will be replaced with a less generous deal which investors expect to pay out less than \u00a320m. The near \u00a342m will be added to Sorrell\u2019s salary, bonus and other extras when WPPpublish its annual report and will probably push his full remuneration for 2016to closer to \u00a350m. WPP said the payout from the Leap is down 34% on the \u00a362.8m he received last year. Since 2012, Sorrell has received close to \u00a3210m in total remuneration, which has consistently ranked him the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100. Despite WPP\u2019s pledge to overhaul executive pay, shareholders have continued to issue rebukes: in 2014, 30% refused to endorse Sorrell\u2019s remuneration and last year, a third refused to back the \u00a370.4m he received, one of the biggest pay cheques in UK corporate history. \u201cThis is the final outcome of the wholly performance-related Leap scheme which was replaced in 2013 with a new long-term scheme with a much-reduced opportunity approved by share owners,\u201d said a WPP spokesman. Last year, Sorrell defended his pay package arguing he had put three decades of his life into building WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a \u00a321bn global marketing business. \u201cI\u2019m not a Johnny come lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years \u2026 I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.\u201d In December, the chair of WPP\u2019s pay committee, Sir John Hood, told MPs that Sorrell was not on a \u201csuperstar\u201d salary. The annual report for Shell shows that van Beurden\u2019s \u20ac8.6m follows \u20ac5.5m in 2013 and \u20ac24.1m in 2014, his first year at the helm when his pay was inflated by by pension payments and \u201ctax equalisation\u201d handouts. It shows that 10% of future bonuses will be linked to managing greenhouse gas emissions. Shell also reveals the debate going on among some investors who want to end the current system of long-term incentive plans, paying out over three years, with awards of restricted shares which do not have performance criteria. The oil company is not yet doing this because of the lack of agreement among shareholders. Rolls-Royce, which recently reported the biggest annual loss in its history \u2013 \u00a34.6bn - revealed that some of its shareholders thought the executive bonuses should be bigger.",

                "bodyText":"If you were looking for an apartment in the Bay Area 18 months ago, realtors recommended you took your checkbook to viewings and were prepared to fork out for the deposit and first month\u2019s rent \u2013 that\u2019s $8,000 to $10,000 for a two-bedroom place in San Francisco \u2013 on the spot. \u201cThere was no negotiation because there were 10 people behind you saying, \u2018We\u2019ll take it\u2019,\u201d said Ron Stern, CEO of housing relocation service Bay Rentals. Today, rents are still expensive, but the market has plateaued after years of painful increases. It\u2019s part of a broader trend in the Bay Area: Silicon Valley\u2019s technology bubble has had some of its wind knocked out \u2013 not bursting, but fizzling \u2013 with VCs making fewer investments, startup valuations falling, and recruitment slowing. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get a lot of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from [software engineers at] companies where the business model isn\u2019t working and they can\u2019t get funding, so they are closing down or cutting back,\u201d said Mark Dinan, a software recruiter based in the Bay Area, who keeps track of companies\u2019 hirings and firings.

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the day, we\u2019ll take a look at the markets. On Wall Street, markets are mixed now trading is fully underway: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,643 S&amp;P 500: +0.04% at 2,345 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,808 European markets are also mixed, with most indices down less they were earlier. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,330 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 11,908 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 4,990 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 19,970 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,232 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 374 Thank you for reading the blog and for commenting. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator for Brexit has set out the bloc\u2019s conditions and priorities for talks. Among the priorities cited were the need for early agreements on citizens\u2019 rights, money and borders. Guaranteeing their rights as European citizens, in the long term, will be our absolute priority from the very start of negotiations. Full story coming soon here. The Dutch government has come out in support of Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the Dutch finance minister faced calls to resign as the leader of the Eurogroup. The controversy centres on comments Dijsselbloem made to a German newspaper, which were taken as a criticism of Southern European countries. Specifically: I can\u2019t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. Reuters quotes an official close to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte as saying the government \u201cremains firmly behind\u201d Dijsselbloem. The official added: The position has not changed. Premier Rutte has repeatedly said we are very supportive of Dijsselbloem in his role at the Eurogroup. The Portuguese prime minister has called for Dijsselbloem\u2019s resignation. Dijsselbloem has not commented. Oil prices are at near four-month lows after the latest figures showed US crude inventories rose faster than expected, exacerbating fears of over supply. Brent crude is down 1.6% at $50.15 a barrel, and fell as low $50.05 earlier, the lowest since 30 November when OPEC countries agreed to cut output to ease oversupply fears. Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts\u2019 forecasts of 2.8 million. US shale oil producers have been increasing the number of rigs, pushing up production. Analysts at US bank Jefferies commented in a note: OPEC\u2019s market intervention has not yet resulted in significant visible inventory drawdowns, and the financial markets have lost patience. Thames Water has been handed a record \u00a320.3m fine after huge leaks of untreated sewage. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency, which said the enormous volume of sewage, at 1.4bn litres, was unprecedented. It relates to numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. Full story here: The pound appears to have lost some of the boost it gained from the sharp rise in UK inflation revealed on Tuesday. (The consumer prices index jumped more than expected to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January, pushed higher by food and fuel prices.) The pound is still above $1.24 but down 0.3% on the day at $1.2440. It is also down 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1516. Wall Street will be closely monitoring any developments in the debate on the Republican health care bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday, and failure to pass it would be a huge blow to Trump. And we\u2019re off... US markets have opened lower, but the early falls are modest: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 20,629 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,342 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,790 Donald Trump is awake and would like to reassure markets: Wall Street bell goes in 10 minutes... Twitter has reacted with a combination of anger and humour to those Dijsselbloem comments that appear to be critical of the behaviour of Southern European countries. The FTSE 100 is currently down 65 points or 0.9% at 7,314. The FTSE 250 is down 1.1% at 18,788. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, provides this lunchtime summary: A partial reversal of the so called \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 has sent defensives and precious metal producers to the top of the FTSE 100 today, as investors worry that President Trump\u2019s conflict with Congress will prevent him delivering the pro-business agenda on which he campaigned. Only six FTSE 100 stocks had made it into positive territory at lunchtime, with Randgold topping the list, up 0.8%. Despite recently warning that conditions remain challenging, hopes of an uptick in the global economy helped FTSE 250 shipping group Clarkson enjoy a strong run recently. However, with pro-Trump sentiment wavering it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising to see this bellwether of global trade lose some of the wind from its sails, sending the shares down 4.5%. Earlier the Bank of England published its latest agents\u2019 summary of business conditions. The Bank has 12 regional agents who have discussions with about 700 firms across the UK to glean the latest snapshot of conditions. The survey for the first quarter of 2017 found that growth in retail sales was slowing as the weak pounds feeds through to higher prices and reduces the spending power of consumers. Overall the report was mixed, with exports up and investment intentions picking up. Agents concluded: Moderate rates of activity growth had continued overall. Retail sales volumes growth had eased. It was expected to slow further during the year ahead as the fall in sterling fed through to higher prices, reducing households\u2019 purchasing power. In contrast, export volume growth had picked up. That was due to the fall in sterling and stronger world growth. Investment intentions had picked up, pointing to modest growth in spending in the year ahead. That reflected continued moderate demand growth and less uncertainty about economic prospects, particularly in the near term. But a lack of visibility of the United Kingdom\u2019s future trading arrangements was weighing on longer-term plans for some contacts. The fall in sterling was being passed through into higher manufacturing output and consumer goods price inflation. Business and consumer services price inflation had edged higher. Over in Brussels, Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - appears to be in a spot of bother. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said Dijsselbloem was \u201cwrong\u201d to make comments that were interpreted as criticism of southern European countries. Speaking to the German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Dijsselbloem said: In the euro crisis, the northern eurozone states demonstrated solidarity with the countries in crisis. As a Social Democrat, I believe solidarity is extremely important. But whoever demands it also has obligations. I can\u2019t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. This principle holds at personal, local, national and even European levels. His comments drew strong criticism in Spain and Italy and the Portuguese prime minister called for Dijsselbloem\u2019s resignation. A spokesman for Dijsselbloem defended his comments along the following lines: He didn\u2019t refer to any specific country or group of countries. His message was that solidarity comes with obligations, and the message was for all eurozone countries. Now for some news from Coventry, where the grand opening of the first new car plant in Britain for more than a decade is taking place today. The London Taxi Company (LTC), maker of the famous London black cab, will build electric cabs at the plant, creating more than 1,000 jobs. It is being funded by a \u00a3300m investment from China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of LTC, plus a \u00a316.1m government grant. As well as being a boost for Coventry it\u2019s a boost for the UK automotive industry, which backed the remain camp in the EU referendum and has voiced concerns that Brexit will lead foreign investment elsewhere. The business secretary Greg Clarke said the new factory, where research and development will also take place, showed that the UK was a \u201cworld leader in the development of new automotive technologies\u201d. Read our full story on the new plant here: Global equities could have quite a bit further to fall according to analysts at Saxo Bank, as Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies hit several hurdles along the way. Peter Garnry, the bank\u2019s head of equity strategy, explains: So much of the narrative has revolved around US president Donald Trump since his election on November 8 but the conviction in the reflation trade faded abruptly in the last US session with the S&amp;P 500 declining more than 1% for the first time since October. So what are we to make of all of this? Where do we go from here? Global equities could easily fall 5-10% in what would be a normal healthy technical correction. And the selloff will be driven by cyclicals: financials, materials, consumer discretionary - a big question mark here is whether technology stocks will hold the line. We see further upside in volatility as markets are now constructing a new narrative that essentially centres on the likelihood that the pro-growth Trump policies or set for a bumpy road with many road blocks . Credit growth has stalled lately and the energy impulse into inflation is gone by June. Gold is benefitting from the widespread equities sell-off and weaker dollar. Spot gold touched a three-week high of $1,248.47 per ounce, and is currently up 0.1% at $1,245. Edward Meir, analyst at INTL FCStone said gold would continue to benefit while investors sold shares: It seems that equity investors decided to take some money of the table, perhaps getting slightly wary about the progress in President Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. Gold will likely continue to rally going into Wednesday\u2019s session as Tuesday\u2019s US stock market sell-off was significant and will likely have a knock-on effect on international equity markets over the next 24 hours. Some people are feeling the pinch more than others of course. A report by the Equality Trust found that the average FTSE bosses earns 386 times more than a worker on the national living wage. Taking 2015 annual reports from all FTSE 100 companies, the charity calculated that chief executives were paid \u00a35.3m a year, compared with \u00a313,662 for someone on the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour. Here is the full story from the Guardian\u2019s Katie Allen: Investors are not the only ones feeling pessimistic. UK households are the most downbeat about prospects for their finances since November 2013 according to the Markit Household Finance Index. Families are starting to feel the pinch of rising inflation, as everyday goods get more expensive and wage growth remains weak. It suggests that consumer spending - the main driver of UK growth currently - will start to weaken as households become more cost conscious. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: UK households reported greater pressure on their financial wellbeing in March, as rising inflation has started to erode incomes and reduce cash available to spend. On average in the first quarter of 2017 survey respondents have reported the sharpest increase in their everyday living costs for three-and-a-half years. A combination of rising inflation and subdued pay trends has forced households to recalibrate their expectations for the year ahead. After holding steady last summer, UK consumers are now more downbeat about their financial outlook than at any time since late-2013. Expectations for finances in the next month fell to 45.3 on the index in March, from 48.1 in February, where anything below 50 signals contraction. People living in the East Midlands were the most downbeat about their financial outlook, followed by those in the North East and London. Meanwhile 58% of households expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months. US futures suggest the sell-off on Wall Street is likely to continue when markets open later: Dow Jones futures: -0.3% Nasdaq futures: -0.2% Is this the end of the Trump rally, asks David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co? European stock indices are weaker across the board this morning. Investors are responding to last night\u2019s sell-off on Wall Street which saw the majors close out on their lows. Not only that, but US stock index futures are weaker again this morning. Yesterday\u2019s sharp reversal took many investors by surprise, particularly as the US session opened with fresh all-time highs for Facebook and the Nasdaq index. Unfortunately for traders, much of yesterday\u2019s move was down to political factors rather than market technicals. There are fears that the Trump administration won\u2019t have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act when it goes to Congress tomorrow. There are thought to be around 26 Republican representatives who oppose their party\u2019s new health care bill. This in turn could jeopardise Trump\u2019s tax plan and this has worried investors who have watched equities soar on the promise of fiscal stimulus. The final scores in Asia: Back in the UK, estate agent Savills has published results. Shares are currently down 1.8%. Julia Kollewe reports: Savills, the upmarket estate agent, has posted annual pretax profits of nearly \u00a3100m, up 1%, despite \u201cgeopolitical distractions\u201d and higher property taxes in the UK and elsewhere. The Brexit vote in June pushed revenues from its UK residential business down 3% to \u00a3124m last year. The firm explained: \u201cA very strong first quarter, as buyers rushed to beat the increased stamp duty on second homes, was followed by low trading volumes in advance of the Brexit referendum at the end of June. Then a relatively quiet, but encouraging summer gave rise to a strong autumn selling season albeit with a slowing of transactions in December.\u201d Savills said the sharp decline in the value of sterling since the referendum had drawn overseas buyers at the top end of the market. The average selling price in London increased slightly to \u00a32.9m because the firm sold more properties worth \u00a320m or more than in 2015. But it still recorded 5% fewer sales overall, while the market suffered even bigger declines. Outside London there was a 7% increase in exchanges. US bond yields are at three-week lows as investors dump equities in favour of lower-risk assets. The yield on benchmark 10-year US treasuries - an indicator of how much it costs the government to borrow from the financial markets - fell to 2.4%. Kingfisher, the company behind B&amp;Q and Screwfix, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning following the publication of annual results. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Shares in Kingfisher fell 4.8% despite better-than-expected results. The retailer warned of modest price increases and expressed concern that uncertainty around French and British politics could hit demand for its DIY products. Chief executive V\u00e9ronique Laury, who is overseeing a five-year revamp of the business, said: \u201cLooking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France, especially in light of the forthcoming presidential elections.\u201d The company beat City forecasts with a 14.7% rise in annual underlying pretax profit to \u00a3787m. A good performance in the UK &amp; Ireland, where like-for-like sales rose 5.9%, offset a 2.7% sales drop in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t. The retailer\u2019s chairman Daniel Bernard is to step down in June after eight years in the role. He will be succeeded by Andy Cosslett, the former chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group and Fitness First, who previously worked at Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. He also chairs Rugby Football Union. Investors are not happy at all this morning. Losses are widening across Europe on fears that Trump is not going to be able to deliver on his policy pledges. Much of the optimism about his policies to boost US (and therefore global) growth has already been priced into markets since his election, with Wall Street and European markets hitting record highs. But as President Trump deals with the reality of governing, it seems determination alone is not enough to push through his flagship policies. If Trump hasn\u2019t yet managed to overhaul Obamacare - his key priority - won\u2019t his promises on tax giveaways and infrastructure spending get kicked into the long grass? Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says markets are in a \u201csour mood\u201d: Based on the mess Republicans are making of their healthcare reforms it seems increasingly unlikely that the Wotsit-in-Chief will be able to deliver on his sweeping tax changes and $1 trillion infrastructure spending. Combine that with the Wall Street Journal, a notably right-leaning publication, claiming that if Trump doesn\u2019t \u2018show more respect for the truth\u2019 then \u2018most Americans may conclude he\u2019s a fake president\u2019, and the optimism that caused investors to flock to the major indices has been seriously undermined by, well, Trump himself. The FTSE 100 is down 72 points as the negative sentiment spreads. The mining sector and financials are taking the brunt of it. Current scores on the board: FTSE 100: -1% at 7,306 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% at 11,871 France\u2019s CAC: -0.8% at 4,963 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 19,706 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% at 10,126 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 373 The pound is just about holding on to the gains it made against the dollar on Tuesday following the sharp rise in UK inflation to 2.3% in February from 1.8%. In theory, the acceleration of inflation brings forward the prospect of a UK interest rate rise and adds weight to the decision by Kristin Forbes - member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee - to vote for a hike at the March meeting (she was outvoted). The pound is also being supported by dollar weakness, and is currently flat at $1.2477. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1550. European markets have opened lower, as fears ripple across the Atlantic over Trump\u2019s ability to push through growth-boosting policies: FTSE 100: -0.6% Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% Nouriel Roubini, the economist who is probably best known for predicting the global financial crisis, has also warned on Trump\u2019s policies. Specifically, the professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business, says markets have over-estimated how many beneficial policies the President can carry through, while underestimating the potential negatives. Roubini told CNBC: [Markets] are overestimating the positives of the US-Trump policies. Infrastructure, stimulus, deregulation, tax cuts: I think Trump will achieve much less on those dimensions. And they\u2019re underestimating the risk that the US protectionist policies are going to lead to trade wars, that the restrictions on immigration are going to slow down labor supply, and that micromanaging the corporate sector is going to be negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares in Asia are down sharply this morning following Wall Street\u2019s worst day this year. It appears that hopes are evaporating of swift action on the growth-boosting policies promised by President Trump. With much of the upside already priced in, investors are now coming to the realisation that for all the talk, it might take longer than expected to push through reforms. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: After the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest one day fall since last October last year, the question being asked is whether the scales are starting to fall away from investor\u2019s eyes as to whether President Trump will be able to deliver anything close to what has been priced into markets since his election last November. Even the mistiest eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised and as such any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future. Here is how US markets closed: Dow Jones: -1.1% at 20,668 S&amp;P 500: -1.2% at 2,344 Nasdaq: -1.5% at 5,333 And in Asia: Hang Seng: -1.3% at 24,275 Nikkei: -2% at 19,041 Topix: -2% at 1,530 Shares in Europe are expected to open lower this morning: We will be tracking all the key developments.",

Europe has taken longer to recover from the financial crisis than any other part of the developed world; four of its countries have needed emergency bailouts; one of its founder members, Italy, has seen living standards stagnate for two decades. Two European countries at either end of the continent suffered worst from the financial crisis: Iceland, which is not part of the euro, saw its banks go bust <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/icelands-economy-miracle-2016-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">but is now booming;</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\">Greece has had a bigger and longer slump </a>than that endured by the US in the Great Depression and is still on financial life support.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trade does not lead to innovation and investment; rather innovation and investment lead to trade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The single currency, which has amplified the impact of the financial crisis for many member countries, is part of the story. But so is a lack of economic dynamism. Consider the companies that have emerged from nowhere to have a big impact since the single market came into being in 1993: Google, Facebook, ebay, Amazon, Uber. The common feature is that they are all American. Many of these companies have emerged from US universities, which fill 17 of the top 25 places in the <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats\">world rankings compiled by the Times Higher Education.</a> Britain has five slots, the rest of the EU has none. </p> <p>Europe has become more sluggish as economic policy has become centralised. Per capita GDP in the original EU6 states gradually converged on American levels in the first four decades after the second world war, peaking at 80% in the 1980s. It has since fallen to 65% of US levels.</p> <p>Over the past decade the volume of UK exports to the EU has grown by only 4% due to stagnation in many eurozone markets, while exports to the rest of the world have grown by 42%. On current trends, the share of Britain\u2019s trade accounted for by the EU will be 30% by 2030, a level last seen in the early 1960s. The latest <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/balanceofpayments/octtodecandannual2016\">balance of payments figures </a>show that Britain runs a deficit with the EU, but a surplus with the rest of the world.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/why-denying-refugees-the-right-to-work-is-a-catastrophic-error\">Why denying refugees the right to work is a catastrophic error | Paul Collier and Alexander Betts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second assumption is that membership of the EU is all that stands between the thriving Britain of today and the low-wage tax haven of tomorrow. Actually, Britain is already a low-wage, low-investment, low-productivity economy that happens to be bolted on to a massive financial centre.</p> <p>It would be fatuous to argue that the EU is somehow responsible for the structural defects of British capitalism, because the dominance of finance over industry and the reluctance to invest in new plant and skills has been a feature of the economy for at least a century.</p> <p>But at the margin, membership of the EU has accentuated those trends. The economic geography of the single market involves an international division of labour so that countries concentrate on what they do best. Germany is best at precision engineering; Britain is best at finance and so has acted as the merchant banker for the rest of the EU. That has made London extremely rich, but widened the gap between the capital and the rest of the country. It is no accident that London was so strongly for remain in the referendum, but its economy has more in common with the crescent of prosperity running through northern Italy, eastern France, the Low Countries and the western L\u00e4nder of Germany than it does with the rest of the UK.<br></p> <p>Similarly, free movement of labour has allowed employers to meet extra demand by taking on more staff at the minimum wage or just above, rather than by investing. That helps explain why employment is at record levels, but productivity has been feeble.</p> <p>The cry from employers now is that curbs on migration will push up their costs and lead to consumers paying higher prices. Actually, consumers are already paying through the taxes that fund the in-work benefits which subsidise poverty wages.</p> <p>There is an argument that says the UK currently has the best of both worlds: it is inside the single market, yet outside the single currency. Up to a point that\u2019s true, but it ignores the fact that the recovery since the financial crash is built on unsound foundations. The feelgood factor is the result of ingesting large doses of monetary happy pills; ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. Mainland Europe is just as addicted to the drugs.<br></p> <p>In their different ways, both Britain and the eurozone are zombie economies: Britain because the economy runs on worryingly high levels of debt; the eurozone because there is no political appetite for the further integration that might make the single currency work.</p> <p>The big challenge for the UK government is not negotiating a free trade deal to replicate as far as possible the access granted by the single market; it is to remedy long-running defects so that the economy is more competitive and sustainable. Trade does not lead to innovation and investment; rather innovation and investment lead to trade.<br></p> <p>Does the UK need Brexit to have a modern industrial strategy, to devolve power or boost public investment? In theory, no. In practice, change comes only during periods of upheaval, when it\u2019s clear the status quo is no longer working. Historically, it is crises that force governments, businesses and individuals out of their comfort zone. Brexit is just such a crisis \u2013 for both Britain and the eurozone. It would be a crying shame to let it go to waste.<br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2017. An earlier version said Iceland \u201cis not \u2026 part of the single market\u201d. To clarify: as a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland does participate in the EU\u2019s single market, with exemptions for agriculture and fisheries policies.</p>",

The single currency, which has amplified the impact of the financial crisis for many member countries, is part of the story. But so is a lack of economic dynamism. Consider the companies that have emerged from nowhere to have a big impact since the single market came into being in 1993: Google, Facebook, ebay, Amazon, Uber. The common feature is that they are all American. Many of these companies have emerged from US universities, which fill 17 of the top 25 places in the world rankings compiled by the Times Higher Education. Britain has five slots, the rest of the EU has none. Europe has become more sluggish as economic policy has become centralised. Per capita GDP in the original EU6 states gradually converged on American levels in the first four decades after the second world war, peaking at 80% in the 1980s. It has since fallen to 65% of US levels. Over the past decade the volume of UK exports to the EU has grown by only 4% due to stagnation in many eurozone markets, while exports to the rest of the world have grown by 42%. On current trends, the share of Britain\u2019s trade accounted for by the EU will be 30% by 2030, a level last seen in the early 1960s. The latest balance of payments figures show that Britain runs a deficit with the EU, but a surplus with the rest of the world. The second assumption is that membership of the EU is all that stands between the thriving Britain of today and the low-wage tax haven of tomorrow. Actually, Britain is already a low-wage, low-investment, low-productivity economy that happens to be bolted on to a massive financial centre. It would be fatuous to argue that the EU is somehow responsible for the structural defects of British capitalism, because the dominance of finance over industry and the reluctance to invest in new plant and skills has been a feature of the economy for at least a century. But at the margin, membership of the EU has accentuated those trends. The economic geography of the single market involves an international division of labour so that countries concentrate on what they do best. Germany is best at precision engineering; Britain is best at finance and so has acted as the merchant banker for the rest of the EU. That has made London extremely rich, but widened the gap between the capital and the rest of the country. It is no accident that London was so strongly for remain in the referendum, but its economy has more in common with the crescent of prosperity running through northern Italy, eastern France, the Low Countries and the western L\u00e4nder of Germany than it does with the rest of the UK. Similarly, free movement of labour has allowed employers to meet extra demand by taking on more staff at the minimum wage or just above, rather than by investing. That helps explain why employment is at record levels, but productivity has been feeble. The cry from employers now is that curbs on migration will push up their costs and lead to consumers paying higher prices. Actually, consumers are already paying through the taxes that fund the in-work benefits which subsidise poverty wages. There is an argument that says the UK currently has the best of both worlds: it is inside the single market, yet outside the single currency. Up to a point that\u2019s true, but it ignores the fact that the recovery since the financial crash is built on unsound foundations. The feelgood factor is the result of ingesting large doses of monetary happy pills; ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. Mainland Europe is just as addicted to the drugs. In their different ways, both Britain and the eurozone are zombie economies: Britain because the economy runs on worryingly high levels of debt; the eurozone because there is no political appetite for the further integration that might make the single currency work. The big challenge for the UK government is not negotiating a free trade deal to replicate as far as possible the access granted by the single market; it is to remedy long-running defects so that the economy is more competitive and sustainable. Trade does not lead to innovation and investment; rather innovation and investment lead to trade. Does the UK need Brexit to have a modern industrial strategy, to devolve power or boost public investment? In theory, no. In practice, change comes only during periods of upheaval, when it\u2019s clear the status quo is no longer working. Historically, it is crises that force governments, businesses and individuals out of their comfort zone. Brexit is just such a crisis \u2013 for both Britain and the eurozone. It would be a crying shame to let it go to waste. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2017. An earlier version said Iceland \u201cis not \u2026 part of the single market\u201d. To clarify: as a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland does participate in the EU\u2019s single market, with exemptions for agriculture and fisheries policies.",

Miliband and Cable, outspoken critics of Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to take over Sky, have the support of the Labour peer and barrister Charles Falconer and of Tory father of the house Kenneth Clarke, who have put their name to the submissions. The media regulator is assessing whether the takeover of Sky raises plurality issues and whether under 21st Century Fox\u2019s full ownership \u2013 it currently controls 39% of the pay-TV company \u2013 broadcasting standards would be maintained. Ofcom, which has until 16 May to deliver its decision to the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, is also reviewing whether Fox is \u201cfit and proper\u201d to take control of Sky\u2019s broadcasting licence. Miliband, Falconer, Clarke and Cable \u2013 who was forced to hand over responsibility for assessing Murdoch\u2019s failed 2010 bid for Sky after telling undercover Daily Telegraph reporters that he was at war with the media mogul \u2013 have filed two lengthy submissions fleshing out their arguments against the deal.
