In December alone, the film sector accounted for half of all growth in the key services sector \u2013 which accounts for 80% of the British economy \u2013 because of box-office takings from UK-made <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> and JK Rowling\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them\" title=\"\"><em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em></a>.</p> <p>The TV production industry is enjoying a golden age of investment, with deep-pocketed new arrivals such as Netflix pouring money into big-budget shows including \u00a3100m royal series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-crown\" title=\"\"><em>The Crown</em></a>.</p> <p>This success is underpinned by a digital-savvy UK whose embrace of new TV and film services saw streaming and downloads of films and TV shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/film-and-tv-streaming-and-downloads-overtake-dvd-sales-for-first-time-netflix-amazon-uk\" title=\"\">pass sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for the first time</a> last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK\u2019s creative economy stands tall on the world stage,\u201d James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said last week.</p> <p>Here is a breakdown of the performance of the UK\u2019s creative economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08c5f4a0c026b61f4c61952cf850b932beb037cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08c5f4a0c026b61f4c61952cf850b932beb037cf/0_327_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Mendelsohn in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was largely shot in the UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Mendelsohn in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was largely shot in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Olley/2016 Lucasfilm Ltd. &amp; \u2122, All Rights Reserved</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Film</strong></h2> <p>Last year\u2019s three biggest grossing films in the UK\u2013 <em>Rogue One, Fantastic Beasts</em> and <em>Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby</em> \u2013 helped drive a near-record box office take with ticket sales of almost \u00a31.3bn. All three were shot in the UK, reflecting the ongoing boom in the film production industry.</p> <p>The industry has flourished over the past decade, following the introduction of a 25% tax break for foreign film-makers, mostly exploited by Hollywood studios that have shot blockbusters in the UK. This has ensured that new films funded by US money such as <em>Star Wars</em>: <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Ridley Scott\u2019s <em>Alien Covenant</em> and Christopher Nolan\u2019s <em>Dunkirk </em>were made in the UK.</p> <p>Last year, a record \u00a31.6bn was spent on film production in the UK, a 13% year-on-year rise, according to the British Film Institute. Of that, \u00a31.35bn was \u201cinward investment\u201d from mostly US studios, an 18% increase on 2015, looking to take advantage of tax breaks and the country\u2019s abundance of off-screen and on-screen talent \u2013 from special effects specialists to actors.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as the UK economy and Treasury are concerned, it is a great success story,\u201d said Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of the parent company of Pinewood and Shepperton studios, which hosted <em>Rogue One</em>.</p> <p>He said: \u201cOur role as major piece of [film and TV production] infrastucture is to keep responding to the growing demand. We brought on stream a whole load of extra capacity on 1 July last year ... we are already having to think about further expansion plans at Pinewood and Shepperton.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e102100aca68462e8a2703a73423fd67434d910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e102100aca68462e8a2703a73423fd67434d910/0_196_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Foy in Netflix\u2019s big-budget series The Crown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Foy in Netflix\u2019s big-budget series The Crown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bailey/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>TV</strong></h2> <p>The arrival of Netflix and Amazon, whose shows have included <em>Outlander </em>and <em>The Collection</em> in the UK, and a film industry-style tax break for glossy shows costing at least \u00a31m an episode has given a huge boost to the television production industry.</p> <p>The BFI says the figure for inward production investment has nearly doubled from \u00a3252m in 2013 to a record of almost \u00a3500m last year.</p> <p>There were 36 productions of high-end TV shows last year, an 11% rise in total spend to \u00a3477.8m. The budgets from mostly US companies accounted for 65% of all investment in high-end TV production in the UK, as Netflix and Amazon joined the likes of long-established players like HBO, which has made <em>Game of Thrones</em> in Northern Ireland since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cThese platforms are buying for a global audience and commissioning ambitious, high-quality shows,\u201d said Jane Turton, chief executive of All3Media, maker of programmes including <em>Midsomer Murders</em>, <em>Shameless</em> and <em>Skins</em>. \u201cUK talent \u2013 be it writers, producers, cast, directors \u2013 are incredibly well-placed to respond.\u201d</p> <p>The industry is also undergoing an export boom, benefiting from sales to international broadcasters of UK-made shows <em>Downton Abbey</em>, <em>Victoria</em>, <em>Poldark</em> and <em>The Night Manager</em> to <em>Top Gear</em>,<em> Sherlock</em> and <em>Come Dine With Me</em>. Further income is generated by selling the rights for local versions of hit formats such as <em>X Factor</em> and <em>The Voice</em>.</p> <p>Sales of UK made shows internationally rose 10% to a record \u00a31.3bn last year, with sales to China rising 40% and the biggest market for British fare \u2013 the US \u2013 climbing 16% according to Pact, the trade body for independent TV producers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d36b22ddb4cfa9fcebdd3a4f19e5986398d627a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d36b22ddb4cfa9fcebdd3a4f19e5986398d627a/0_93_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie\u2019s last album, Blackstar, on sale last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie\u2019s last album, Blackstar, on sale last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Music</h2> <p>After years of declining CD sales and the threat of piracy, the music industry is back in fine health.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of recorded music it is very simple, growth is all being driven by streaming,\u201d said industry analyst Mark Mulligan. \u201cNext year, streaming will overtake [the value] of CD [sales] for the first time. We have finally got to the stage where streaming is growing strongly enough to offset the decline in legacy formats.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, 45bn audio streams were served in the UK by players such as Spotify, Apple, Deezer and Tidal, an increase of 68% year-on-year, according to music industry body the BPI.</p> <p>In terms of value, streaming jumped 65% to \u00a3418m, just behind physical sales of \u00a3475m, as digital services kept the total music market in growth up 4.6% to \u00a31.1bn, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association.</p> <p>The popularity of physical formats continues to decline: CD sales fell 13%, despite the surprising the resurgent record market, which hit a 25-year high last year led by David Bowie\u2019s final album <em>Blackstar</em>.</p> <p>The UK live music scene is also in fine fettle showing 37% growth from \u00a3662m to \u00a3904m between 2012 and 2015, according to UK Music.</p> <p>.</p>",

The combined UK film, TV and music industry boomed in the second half of last year, growing almost 11% compared with the previous six months, according to government figures. In December alone, the film sector accounted for half of all growth in the key services sector \u2013 which accounts for 80% of the British economy \u2013 because of box-office takings from UK-made Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and JK Rowling\u2019s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The TV production industry is enjoying a golden age of investment, with deep-pocketed new arrivals such as Netflix pouring money into big-budget shows including \u00a3100m royal series The Crown. This success is underpinned by a digital-savvy UK whose embrace of new TV and film services saw streaming and downloads of films and TV shows pass sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for the first time last year. \u201cThe UK\u2019s creative economy stands tall on the world stage,\u201d James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said last week. Here is a breakdown of the performance of the UK\u2019s creative economy. Film Last year\u2019s three biggest grossing films in the UK\u2013 Rogue One, Fantastic Beasts and Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby \u2013 helped drive a near-record box office take with ticket sales of almost \u00a31.3bn. All three were shot in the UK, reflecting the ongoing boom in the film production industry. The industry has flourished over the past decade, following the introduction of a 25% tax break for foreign film-makers, mostly exploited by Hollywood studios that have shot blockbusters in the UK. This has ensured that new films funded by US money such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien Covenant and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk were made in the UK. Last year, a record \u00a31.6bn was spent on film production in the UK, a 13% year-on-year rise, according to the British Film Institute. Of that, \u00a31.35bn was \u201cinward investment\u201d from mostly US studios, an 18% increase on 2015, looking to take advantage of tax breaks and the country\u2019s abundance of off-screen and on-screen talent \u2013 from special effects specialists to actors. \u201cAs far as the UK economy and Treasury are concerned, it is a great success story,\u201d said Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of the parent company of Pinewood and Shepperton studios, which hosted Rogue One. He said: \u201cOur role as major piece of [film and TV production] infrastucture is to keep responding to the growing demand. We brought on stream a whole load of extra capacity on 1 July last year ... we are already having to think about further expansion plans at Pinewood and Shepperton.\u201d TV The arrival of Netflix and Amazon, whose shows have included Outlander and The Collection in the UK, and a film industry-style tax break for glossy shows costing at least \u00a31m an episode has given a huge boost to the television production industry. The BFI says the figure for inward production investment has nearly doubled from \u00a3252m in 2013 to a record of almost \u00a3500m last year. There were 36 productions of high-end TV shows last year, an 11% rise in total spend to \u00a3477.8m. The budgets from mostly US companies accounted for 65% of all investment in high-end TV production in the UK, as Netflix and Amazon joined the likes of long-established players like HBO, which has made Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland since 2010. \u201cThese platforms are buying for a global audience and commissioning ambitious, high-quality shows,\u201d said Jane Turton, chief executive of All3Media, maker of programmes including Midsomer Murders, Shameless and Skins. \u201cUK talent \u2013 be it writers, producers, cast, directors \u2013 are incredibly well-placed to respond.\u201d The industry is also undergoing an export boom, benefiting from sales to international broadcasters of UK-made shows Downton Abbey, Victoria, Poldark and The Night Manager to Top Gear, Sherlock and Come Dine With Me. Further income is generated by selling the rights for local versions of hit formats such as X Factor and The Voice. Sales of UK made shows internationally rose 10% to a record \u00a31.3bn last year, with sales to China rising 40% and the biggest market for British fare \u2013 the US \u2013 climbing 16% according to Pact, the trade body for independent TV producers. Music After years of declining CD sales and the threat of piracy, the music industry is back in fine health. \u201cIn terms of recorded music it is very simple, growth is all being driven by streaming,\u201d said industry analyst Mark Mulligan. \u201cNext year, streaming will overtake [the value] of CD [sales] for the first time. We have finally got to the stage where streaming is growing strongly enough to offset the decline in legacy formats.\u201d Last year, 45bn audio streams were served in the UK by players such as Spotify, Apple, Deezer and Tidal, an increase of 68% year-on-year, according to music industry body the BPI. In terms of value, streaming jumped 65% to \u00a3418m, just behind physical sales of \u00a3475m, as digital services kept the total music market in growth up 4.6% to \u00a31.1bn, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. The popularity of physical formats continues to decline: CD sales fell 13%, despite the surprising the resurgent record market, which hit a 25-year high last year led by David Bowie\u2019s final album Blackstar. The UK live music scene is also in fine fettle showing 37% growth from \u00a3662m to \u00a3904m between 2012 and 2015, according to UK Music. .",

                "bodyText":"Parcel delivery firms DPD and Parcelforce Worldwide could be called before a parliamentary committee to answer questions about the working conditions faced by their self-employed couriers. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions select committee, has written to the bosses of both companies asking them to contribute to an ongoing inquiry into the gig economy, after the Guardian revealed drivers were charged up to \u00a3250 if they could not provide cover when they were ill. Field set the companies a deadline of 20 March to provide details of their contracts with \u201cowner-driver\u201d couriers. Owner-drivers are not directly employed by the company and must fund their own vehicle, fuel, insurance and uniform in return for payment per delivery. Owner-drivers have a contract to deliver in a specified area and must pay for the cost of finding a replacement if they are off sick and do not provide an alternative courier themselves. \u201cThe owner-driver approach creates the opportunity of greater financial returns for the owner-driver,\u201d a spokesperson for Parcelforce said. \u201cLike any other business, however, the owner-driver is responsible for that business, rather than being an employee.\u201d Earlier this week Field said the charges appeared to be part of a \u201cbidding war, to see who can slap the biggest penalty on workers who are sick\u201d. Field has asked companies to explain the policy, including the legal basis of charging owner-drivers for taking the day off due to illness. He asked them to calculate how much couriers could expect to lose out on when sick, including lost earnings. Parcelforce Worldwide\u2019s managing director, Gary Simpson, and DPD\u2019s UK chief executive, Dwain McDonald, were also told to supply a copy of the contract governing self-employed couriers. They were asked to provide data on the number of times courier rounds are covered by a substitute driver and how often each company has to source a replacement because the owner-driver is unable to do so. Field asked them to detail the costs couriers are expected to meet themselves, such as uniform and fuel, as well as data on their average hourly rate and information about what efforts the companies go to to ensure owner-drivers are earning the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Further information requested includes the hours couriers work per week and how long they have worked for the company. Couriers have become a focal point of concerns about the precarious nature of employment in the gig economy, which is the subject of a review commissioned by Theresa May and led by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor. Earlier this week, couriers who carry blood supplies and passports kicked off two new challenges to the gig economy. Five cyclists, motorcyclists and van drivers carrying emergency blood supplies to hospitals and samples to laboratories launched a claim against the Doctors Laboratory challenging their self-employed status, in the first gig economy test case to hit the healthcare sector. More than 20 van drivers working for DX, an Aim-listed courier firm which works for Amazon, the US embassy and dozens of other clients, began legal action questioning their employment status. Speaking on Tuesday at the first hearing into the future world of work by the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee, Hannah Reed, a senior policy officer at the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cThere should be a floor of rights for all working people \u2013 a single worker definition.\u201d Sue Tumelty, the founder and managing director of consultancy HR Dept, said: \u201cI would like the \u2018worker\u2019 category to go.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"The multibillionaire behind the Zara retail chain has banked another \u00a31bn after the fashion group reported record sales and profits. Amancio Ortega, Europe\u2019s richest man, will receive \u20ac1.26bn (\u00a31.1bn) from Inditex, the Spanish company he started more than four decades ago, which owns Zara and many other brands.. Ortega, 80, is still the biggest shareholder in Galicia-based Inditex and will receive the cash as dividend payments after the company revealed record financial results for 2016. The world\u2019s fourth richest person and the wealthiest European, Ortega has a fortune estimated at $71.5bn (\u00a358bn), according to the Forbes World\u2019s Billionaires rankings. Only Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates ($86.bn), investor Warren Buffett ($78.3bn) and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos ($73.4bn) are wealthier. The world\u2019s largest clothing retailer said it would pay shareholders a dividend \u20ac0.68 per share, up 13.3% year on year, as a result of the group\u2019s record results. Ortega\u2019s shareholding will generate the \u00a31bn payout, and take the total earned by the billionaire from this single source to more than \u20ac6bn since 2010. The billonaire owns almost 60% of Inditex through two companies, Pontegadea Inversiones and Partler. He is fiercely private \u2013 rarely interviewed and hardly photographed \u2013 but he is a familiar face in La Coru\u00f1a, the Galician city in northern Spain and a short distance from Arteixo, where Inditex is headquartered. Ortega opened the first Zara store in A Coru\u00f1a in 1975. He was a local clothing manufacturer who had worked his way up from being a delivery boy at a shirtmakers and went on to build Inditex, now a global retailer. Inditex reported a 10% jump in same-store sales in 2016, after it invested \u20ac1.4bn in its warehouses, technology, new stores and online expansion. Sales grew in all markets, including the UK \u2013 where some rivals, such as Next and Marks &amp; Spencer, have found trade tough. Net profit also rose 10%, to \u20ac3.2bn, while total sales rose to more than \u20ac23bn. Pablo Isla, the chair and chief executive of Inditex, said: \u201cThese are a positive set of results against a backdrop of strong prior-year performance. This is a direct result of the commitment, spirit and ambition of all the professionals comprising the group, their dedication to the company, passion for fashion and focus on sustainability.\u201d The company, which also includes the Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear brands, opened 279 stores last year in 56 markets, taking its total number of shops to almost 7,300. There were 51 new Zara stores, bringing the worldwide total to more than 2,200. Inditex employs 162,450 people after creating about 9,600 jobs in 2016. It has invested heavily in its warehouses in its home country, to allow clothing to be packed and dispatched at a faster rate. The company said highlights in 2016 included the rollout of a Zara range designed to mark the release of the Rolling Stones\u2019 new album, Blue &amp; Lonesome, and the Join Life collection, made with sustainable fabrics. Zara Home launched its first perfume for men and women, as well as its first washing powder, fabric conditioner and ironing range. In the UK, Inditex refurbished its flagship Bershka store on Oxford Street in London and is currently expanding its Zara store in the capital\u2019s Westfield White City shopping centre. The group has announced plans to hand employees more than \u20ac535m in 2017, over and above their ordinary salaries. Richard Chamberlain, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the results for 2016 were reassuring. \u201cWe view Inditex as a long-term global multi-channel winner in apparel. We see potential for it to generate durable low- to mid-teens growth over time,\u201d he added. Zara\u2019s fast fashion is speedy route to big profits Zara\u2019s record sales over the past year will surprise no one in the fashion industry who\u2019s looked inside a store in the past 12 months. Like C\u00e9line or Johanna Ortiz but can\u2019t afford them? Zara had the same looks at just 5% of the designer price. Yet despite spending nothing on advertising, the 10% increase in sales suggests Zara has transcended fashion-forward, mid-range shops such as Mango and H&amp;M. It is now a status brand rather than just an affordable high street shop, with fans including the Duchess of Cambridge and street-style star Olivia Palermo.

Economist Jonathan Loynes said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence.</p> <p>Indeed, it\u2019s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u2019s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further.</p> <p>If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u2019t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u2019s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u2019 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy.</p> <p>And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn.</p> <p>For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u2019t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7636e4b01ea2330bce59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:43:38.329Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters.

This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime.</p> <p>It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u2019t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58da7350e4b01ea2330bce47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-28T14:34:34.714Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000.</strong></p> <p>The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumers\u2019 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably.

                "bodyText":"Breaking! The Dow Jones industrial average has ended its eight-day long run of losses, and avoided its worst losing streak in almost 40 years. The benchmark index has closed up around 0.75%, as Wall Street regained its poise after some nervous sessions. Traders cited the surge in consumer confidence to a 16-year high today, and hopes that Donald Trump will manage to get his tax reforms (tax cuts, more likely) through Congress. Tom Porcelli of RBC Capital Markets says: One of the most fundamental drivers of the backdrop is employment. What we just got from the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence report should embolden those that believe continued labor market tightening (and accelerating wage growth) is in the offing. Financial stocks, and consumer goods makers, led the rally. The top performer on the Dow was Apple, which closed at a new alltime high of $143.92 per share. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up. Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting. GW With just 10 minutes to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is on track to break its losing streak. The Dow\u2019s currently up 160 points, or almost 0.8%, at 20,712 points. Surely nothing can shake the rally?.... Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York, believes improved economic data (such as today\u2019s consumer confidence figures) are helping share prices today. He says (via Reuters): This market is driven by two things - the hope of policy agenda getting put into place and improving fundamentals. Here\u2019s our news story about Britain\u2019s newest coin, and the challenges we faced when trying to use it... Wall Street might avoid racking up its worst run of losses since 1978. The main indices are all in green right now, meaning the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to avoid its ninth fall in a row. Investors are cheered by the news that US consumer confidence has hit a 16-year high today. However, they\u2019re also still pondering Donald Trump\u2019s ability to get his legislative agenda through Congress.... Back in South Africa, the rand remains under pressure as investors continue to fret that finance minister Pravin Gordhan could be replaced soon. There\u2019s no official word about Gordhan\u2019s position, since he was told to cut short his trip to meet European and US investors and return home this morning. And this lack of clarity means the rand is down 1.65% today at 12.95 to the US dollar. A weaker pound ahead of the triggering of Article 50 on Wednesday boosted the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners who benefit from any slip in sterling. Positive results from building materials group Wolseley also helped matters, as did an early rise on Wall Street after eight days of decline. Meanwhile European markets were also recovering, while oil prices moved higher after problems with supplies in Libya. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.68% or 49.92 points at 7343.42 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.28% to 12,149.42 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.57% higher at 5046.20 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.02% to 20,330.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.84% at 10,389.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 664.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.44%. The pound has slipped back further following McCafferty\u2019s comments, and is now down 0.46% at $1.2497. Investec\u2019s chief economist says: There may also be some effect from the vote in the Scottish Parliament to call for a second independence referendum. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, is on radio station LBC\u2019s phone in at the moment. My colleague Katie Allen is following the broadcast: A cry of excitement went up at Chapel market as a new pound coin was used to pay for eight tangerines. But John, who has run the neighbouring picture framing stall for more than twenty years, said he was disappointed by its appearance. \u201cIt looks like a token, not a proper coin. it seems unfair to me that businesses such as Arcade owners etc are having to pay for the costs of converting machines. That should be a cost that the Government covers.\u201d In Islington the vast majority of parking meters have been converted to payment by mobile phone only. HSBC at Baker Street was one of several bank branches we popped into to question availability, and where staff said they did not expect to receive the new coin until Friday at the earliest. Even cabbies are up in arms over the changes. Black cab driver Ivan Sobell from Barnet, North London, accepted a new one one as payment, only to find out that it is slightly too big to fit into his coin tube, where he stashes up to fifteen coins at a time. \u201cI\u2019ll have to invest in a smartie tube\u201d, he joked, saying it was the first - and likely to be the last - he had received in a fare today. Coin-operated launderettes - a dying species these days - are also likely to disappoint users holding only the new coins. At the Barbican launderette, a bank of giant washer dryers still take only the old coins, for 19 minutes drying time. Back with our test drive of the new pound coin: At Chapel market in Islington, north London, a busy shopping centre where major supermarkets fringe an old-fashioned fruit and vegetable market, no shoppers had yet seen the new coin and there was no information from retailers informing them of it. A hundred-odd trolleys linked together and locked outside the large Sainsbury\u2019s had \u2018dual slots\u2019 designed to accommodate the old pound coin and the one euro coin. The new twelve-sided coin fits into the slot that accommodates the euro so there has been no need to upgrade the trolleys. Thanks to the helpful member of Sainsbury\u2019s staff who came outside to show me and explain to other shoppers. The same dual slot is also in use in frozen food store Iceland. Waitrose\u2019s trolleys had no locks at all, and the nearby Marks &amp; Spencer had only plastic trolley-style baskets with extendable handles, which are not lockable. But at the nearby Tesco Metro on Islington Green, the trolleys in use had old-style locks which take only the old-style pound and not the new one. Shoppers said they would have to remember to always have an old coin in a handy place. Tesco has promised that it will unlock all trolleys that are not compatible with the new coin, but this store has obviously slipped through the net. Capital Economics suggests that the triggering of Article 50 - finally - could actually give some support to the pound. Economist Jonathan Loynes said: While the triggering of Article 50 is a major step along the road to Brexit, it will hardly come as a shock. Any suggestions that the UK might not actually leave the EU disappeared months ago. And the 52% of referendum voters who wanted Brexit will presumably be pleased to see the process finally commence. Indeed, it\u2019s perhaps more likely that the formal commencement of Brexit will give the pound another boost. If the UK government\u2019s letter announcing Article 50 contains conciliatory language, and this is echoed in the response from the EU, then hard Brexit worries could certainly dissipate somewhat further. If an easing of Brexit worries does raise the pound further, this will no doubt be seen by many as a positive development. But it wouldn\u2019t be unambiguously good news. After all, sterling\u2019s post-referendum depreciation has boosted exporters\u2019 order books and helped to facilitate some long-desired rebalancing of the economy. And, if sustained, a stronger pound could prove an awkward obstacle to the process of normalising UK monetary policy which some MPC members are keen to commence in order to ease the distortions caused by very low interest rates and provide new ammunition with which to respond to the next economic downturn. For now, none of this will trouble the MPC too much. After all, the pound could soon start to drop back against the US dollar at least if, as we expect, market expectations for US interest rates start to rise again. And even if it doesn\u2019t, the MPC will instinctively prefer a strongish exchange rate to a weakish one. But a further significant rise in the pound could certainly present the Committee with some difficult choices. With Article 50 to be triggered on Wednesday, the pound is suffering some pre-Brexit jitters. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound [fell] by 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro after having been in the green before the bell rang on Wall Street. This in turn freed up the FTSE, which rose by 20 points to re-cross the 7300 mark it had been struggling with at lunchtime. It is going to be interesting to see how sterling behaves on Wednesday; Article 50 isn\u2019t like a Fed meeting, where a surprise could be sprung. It is almost just a formality, if, admittedly, one that carries a rather nasty reminder about the years of volatility and insecurity investors can expect as the Brexit negotiations officially get underway. US consumers seem to be taking things in their stride, with the latest confidence figures hitting their highest level since December 2000. The conference board consumer confidence index jumped from 116.1 in February to 125.6, with board director Lynn Franco saying: Consumers\u2019 assessment of current business and labour market conditions improved considerably. Consumers also expressed much greater optimism regarding the short-term outlook for business, jobs and personal income prospects. Thus, consumers feel current economic conditions have improved over the recent period, and their renewed optimism suggests the possibility of some upside to the prospects for economic growth in the coming months. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The incredible hike in consumer confidence will be a huge boost to US business, with the figures jumping to an unexpected 16-year high. Over in the US, and it looks like being touch and go whether the Dow Jones racks up its longest losing streak for nearly 40 years. After an opening fall, the Dow is now up 25 points although there is a long way yet to go. After the Trump rally following the US election result in November and the expectation that the new president would boost the economy with tax reforms and infrastructure spending the doubts have set in. The failure of Trump\u2019s healthcare bill has investors wondering whether he will be able to pass any of his other proposals and the uncertainty is taking the shine off the market, as well as weakening the dollar. But last night\u2019s recovery from its worst levels seems to be giving the US market some support at the moment. The new \u00a31 coin has passed its last test...it works in the luggage trolleys outside Kings Cross station. The parking meters in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields near the High Court in London also don\u2019t take the new pound coin. But there\u2019s better news at Holborn underground station; the new coin works in the ticket machines, so we\u2019ve topped up an Oyster card. Car drivers who try to park in Liverpool today will struggle to use the new \u00a31, judging by this photo: All you need to know about Britain\u2019s new \u00a31 coin, in just one minute: Eva Karras-Balint, receptionist at the London School of Economics\u2019 Old Building, likes the look of the new pound coin. She tells us: \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. It\u2019s definitely an improvement. It looks a bit like the \u00a32 coin and I like the way it looks.\u201d However, things take a disappointing turn when we try to spend our \u00a31 on a well-earned hot chocolate. The new quid does not work in a hot drinks vending machine at the London School of Economics. It falls straight through. Chris Whittall of the Wall Street Journal reckons the Dow could rack up its longest losing run in almost 40 years today, if it closes in the red again. Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in around 50 hour\u2019s time, as investors continue to digest Donald Trump\u2019s failure on healthcare reform. After eight falls in a row, the Dow is tipped to shed a few more points at the open. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says traders are still edgy. Today, US index futures are currently pointing to a slightly weaker open, with European markets struggling to hold onto their earlier gains. So, there seems to be some stability in the markets at the time of this writing. But the lack of any major news or other fundamental events, there\u2019s little or no reason for the on-going \u2018risk-off\u2019 mood to turn decisively positive. Thus, equities could fall back later on today or this week, even if technically the markets look more stable. Put another way, safe haven assets like gold and Japanese yen may remain underpinned. More \u00a31 teething problems... You won\u2019t be able to make a phone call from a phone booth with the new pound coin - it came straight back out. Slightly embarrassingly, the new \u00a31 won\u2019t work on machines at the nearest pub to the Royal Mint\u2019s factory in Llantrisant, near Cardiff. According to Wales News, workers won\u2019t be able to use the 12-sided coin in the pool table of The Three Saints, or the children\u2019s toy machine either! Wales News reports: More than 300 million of the shiny new coins made at the Royal Mint at it\u2019s high-security Welsh base were released today. But many vending machines have not been adapted in time - including the Three Saints less than 200 yards from the entrance to the Mint. The fruit machine was altered just in time but the pool table and the children\u2019s toy vending machine is still old-school coins. Hotel worker Jade Davies said: \u201cSome workers came in last week to work on the fruit machine. They came in especially to alter it so it\u2019s ready for the new \u00a31 coin. \u201cBut the kid\u2019s toy machine won\u2019t accept the new coins just yet.\u201d South Eastern trains is rather belatedly going to put up signs on cash ticket machines this afternoon to alert customers to the introduction of the new coin. Cashiers in the ticket office in London Bridge had not seen any of the new coins yet (at least until The Guardian turned up with a handful). A customer in her 60s was intrigued and came over to look at the new coin. Pointing to her grey hair, she said: \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember the old threepenny bit. it looks a bit like that.\u201d We\u2019ve tracked down Britain\u2019s shiny new \u00a31 coin, but found a few problems when we actually tried to spend one of them.... Julia Kollewe explains: We just tried to buy a \u00a33 ticket to London Bridge from Charing Cross but the new pound coin got stuck in the ticket machine (at least we got it back). Disappointing! But fortunately this tale has a happy ending... When we tried a different ticket machine we managed to buy the ticket with three brand new coins. Hooray! It\u2019s not looking very good for South Africa\u2019s finance minister.... South Africa\u2019s finance minister has landed back in the country, having been hauled back from his investor roadtrip by prime minister Zuma. Pravin Gordhan didn\u2019t sound too rattled when he met with reporters, saying; The president is my boss so if he asks us to come back, we come back. \u201cThere are many in government who want to do the right thing and make sure we keep our economy on track and keep our development moving in the right direction.\u201d The rand is still under pressure, though, thanks to those rumours that Gordhan could be sacked today. It\u2019s currently down 1.5% at 12.935 to the US dollar. It\u2019s an exciting day for numismatic lovers, as Britain\u2019s new \u00a31 coin goes into circulation. Billed as the \u201cmost secure\u201d coin of its type in the world, it is thinner, lighter and slightly bigger than the old quid. It also has 12 sides -- which is likely to cause problems with any vending machines that haven\u2019t been updated. The new \u00a31 coins also have a snazzy feature - a hologram-like image that changes from a \u201c\u00a3\u201d symbol to the number \u201c1\u201d when viewed from different angle. However..The newly minted \u00a31 coins are hard to get. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports that: Only certain bank branches had received them by this morning. At Santander in Triton Square, London, only customers of the bank can withdraw the new coins from their account, up to \u00a320. So if you find one today, at least you can watch it here: The problems that have dogged Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Derbyshire have not been fully addressed, MPs have heard this morning. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee that Mike Ashley\u2019s retail group have tackled some issues..but many others remain resolved. Turner explains to the committee that: 1) Sports Direct had refused to employ all its agency staff who make up the bulk of its workforce, as the union has pushed for. It is currently moving 10 workers per month onto its books, which means it would take 27 years to complete the job. 2) Those agency staff are still on contracts that only guarantee 366 hours per year, so a full-time worker will have used them up by the end of February. 3) There has been no progress on agreeing collective bargaining for workers at the Shirebrook site. More positively, Turner confirmed that the notorious \u2018six strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 policy enforced by employment agencies has been axed, and Sports Direct has taken its own staff off zero hour\u2019s contracts. Where an issue has been in the public gaze, they\u2019ve taken action, Turner concluded. But where it\u2019s not, or where they\u2019ve said it\u2019s not their responsibility, they\u2019ve not taken action. You can watch the hearing here. Despite Wolseley\u2019s rally, the Footsie has now dipped into the red. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons that traders are getting a touch of Brexit nerves, with Theresa May planning to trigger Article 50 on Wednesday. Beauchamp says: The recovery in US markets last night and a relatively positive session in Asia is not translating into gains for the FTSE 100 this morning, and the nearness of the Article 50 activation is undoubtedly contributing to the air of nervousness. A lack of newsflow continues to bedevil this market, but the rebound off the lows for Wall Street indicates that there is still plenty of buying pressure out there. Other European markets are still up though: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is being supported by Wolseley, the plumping and building chain. Its shares have jumped by over 6% today to a five-year high, after it cheered the City by posting a 25% rise in profits. The recovery was driven by Wolseley\u2019s business in North America, called Ferguson, which made up for tougher trading conditions in the UK and the Nordic regions. The firm also announced that it plans to rename itself Ferguson - good news for any of us who struggle to either spell or pronounce Wolseley (I normally plump for \u201cWool-zee\u201d). Asian markets have posted solid gains today as investors moved on from worrying about Donald Trump\u2019s healthcare setback. The Australian index jumped by 1.5%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose by 1.1%, and there were gains in Hong Kong too. Traders weren\u2019t too disconcerted by the US Dow racking up its eighth daily fall on Monday. Although that\u2019s the worst run since 2011, it\u2019s worth noting that the actual decline is quite modest - at just 1.7%. Hardly a Trump Slump (yet, anyway). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: The \u2018Trump slump\u2019 narrative is an ugly piece of hyperbole. As but one example, the seven consecutive day fall in the Dow Industrials in the week to Friday amounted to a cumulative -1.69%, which is the third smallest 7-day setback in the history of the index. The head of Germany\u2019s Chambers of Commerce has claimed this morning that Brexit will have serious impact on trade with the UK. Eric Schweitzer warned that four in 10 German companies expect business with Britain to weaken, adding: \u201cWe should expect further declines in trade in the coming months.\u201d Of course, it all depends what kind of deal the UK and the rest of Europe can agree. London mayor Sadiq Khan has just called for an agreement that offers \u201ccontinued fortune and prosperity\u201d to both sides. More here: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains why shares are recovering from Monday\u2019s wobble: Bond and FX market participants\u2019 reaction to the failure of the healthcare bill has been to re-price Treasuries and the Dollar under the assumption that President Trump has lost a little of his shine. Equity market participants have taken a look at the lower yields and weaker dollar and decided that since absurdly low rates are the elixir that the equity bull market lives on, they might as well \u2018buy the dip\u2019 yet again. Meanwhile in the UK, supermarket chain Tesco will pay a \u00a3129m fine after coming to a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office over its 2014 accounting scandal. Tesco will also pay \u00a385m of compensation to investors who bought shares and bonds in summer 2014, shortly before the false accounting came to light. More here: Separately, two top Tesco shareholders have gone public with their concerns over its proposed takeover of wholesale food producer Booker. They fear that Tesco is paying too much, and might derail its own turnaround plan/. Shares in Booker are down 2% this morning. European stock markets have shaken off Monday\u2019s gloom, and opened higher this morning. Germany\u2019s DAX is the best performer, up around 0.5%, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained a more more modest 0.15%. And the Stoxx 600 index, which tracks major companies across the region, is up 0.3%. The markets are calmer today, as investors ponder if Donald Trump can push through tax reforms, infrastructure spending and deregulate the US economy. FXTM chief market Strategist Hussein Sayed explains: The success of execution on any of these legislations is probably lower now than it was just last week, but investors are still giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt. However, if they see that these plans will face the same destiny as the Health Care Act, markets will soon turn to aggressive selling as the expected companies\u2019 earnings growth and pace of economic recovery are not enough to support currently overstretched valuations. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Mkokeli, South African president Jacob Zuma told communist parties leaders that he\u2019s planning to sack finance minister Pravin Gordhan. He adds: Speculation that Gordhan is on the verge of being fired has swirled for months, as he clashed with Zuma over the management of state companies and the national tax agency. While Gordhan has led efforts to keep spending in check and fend off a junk credit rating, Zuma wants to embark on \u201cradical economic transformation\u201d that he says will tackle racial inequality and widespread poverty. The rand has now lost almost 5% of its value since yesterday lunchtime, when news broke that finance minister Gordhan had been summoned home; South Africa\u2019s currency is suffering heavy losses in early trading, on rumours that the country\u2019s finance minister is about be sacked. The rand tumbled by almost 2.2% at the open, to just 13.01 rand to the US dollar. As this video clip of the US dollar-rand exchange rate shows, it was a very sharp move indeed. South African government bonds also came under pressure, sending the yield (or interest rate) on the debt sharply higher. The selloff came after finances chief Pravin Gordhan was dramatically summoned back to South Africa, from a trip to meet investors in the UK and America. This has sparked speculation that prime minister Jacob Zuma might be planning a cabinet reshuffle. The two men have been locked in something of a power struggle recently, with Gordhan resisting pressure from Zuma to raise government spending and borrowing. They have also clashed over an influential business family, the Guptas, who are friendly with Zuma - and accused of wielding undue political influence. Bloomberg reported earlier today that Gordhan\u2019s job might be on the line. That helped to send the rand sliding, as the finance minister is popular with City investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. What goes down must come up again. So we\u2019re expecting Europe\u2019s financial markets to open higher today today, and claw back some of Monday\u2019s losses. Last night, America\u2019s Dow Jones Industrial Average racked up its longest losing streak since 2011, after the Republican Party was forced to pull its proposed replacement for Obamacare. The theory in the City today is that following his failure to get healthcare reform through Congress last week, Donald Trump will be determined to achieve some tax reforms. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: President Trump may have to modify his style somewhat, and add a few chapters to his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and work on the art of the schmooze. His belligerent style may work well on the campaign trail but on Capitol Hill it doesn\u2019t work well at all. For all his optimism that he can park his health care reforms and come back to them later, while moving on to tax reform, and or infrastructure spending, there is rising scepticism amongst investors that he will fare much better on this score either, however some in the market do appear to want to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. However.... the president doesn\u2019t appear to be in the mood for schmoozing. Instead, he took to Twitter last night to blame his own side for the healthcare debacle: Also coming up today.... There may be drama in South Africa, after the country\u2019s finance minister was recalled from an investor roadshow yesterday; something that has worried investors. MPs on the Business committee are holding an inquiry into the Future of Work today. They\u2019ll hear from, among others, Transline - the employment agency which suppliers workers to Sports Direct, and which was axed by Amazon two weeks ago. On the corporate front, building materials group Wolseley, betting chain Ladbrokes Coral, drinks maker AG Barr and top-hat-and-tails renters Moss Bros are all reporting results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",
