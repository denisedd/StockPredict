                "bodyText":"Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take control of the whole of Sky through his entertainment business 21st Century Fox should be rejected on competition grounds alone, according to research to be published on Wednesday. In a submission to the minister considering the bid, campaigners at the Media Reform Coalition and online activist network Avaaz argue that the overall market shares of both Murdoch-owned newspapers the Sun and the Times as well as Sky remain \u201cmaterially unchanged\u201d since 2011, when media regulator Ofcom raised concerns about a similar takeover. The report, which urges the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, to reject the bid given the \u201cunprecedented case for intervention on plurality grounds\u201d, is to land on her desk as Fox is expected to formally notify the European competition regulator of its \u00a311.7bn bid for full control of Sky this week. Justin Schlosberg, the chair of the coalition, said the situation in terms of media competition was \u201cdefinitely no better than last time and probably worse\u201d. In support, he cited the fact that the Sun\u2019s audience reach had increased after the removal of the paywall for its digital content despite declining print circulation; the increased reach for Sky television services through digital services such as YouTube; and research from Cardiff University last year that the newspapers had a disproportionate impact on broadcasters, for example. Cardiff University research on coverage of the 2015 general election \u201cdemonstrates the influence of national newspapers \u2013 and News UK titles in particular \u2013 over the issue agenda of broadcasters including the BBC\u201d, it said. Supporters of the bid by Fox, which is 39% owned by the Murdochs, have argued that an increasingly competitive media landscape with digital rivals such as Google and Facebook has diminished the influence of the family\u2019s media empire in the UK. Fox executives have argued that there is no need even for a referral given the increased competition. However, the coalition, which argues that the British media market place is one of the most concentrated in the world, believes media concentration has increased since 2011. In the summary to the report, the coalition argues that its objections are \u201clinked to, but separate from\u201d the concerns over the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test. This was raised during the last attempt by the Murdochs to take over the whole of Sky at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Separately, Lord Puttnam has introduced an amendment to the digital economy bill, which would subject all media takeovers to the fit and proper test and which is expected to be debated in the House of Lords. This comes after a group of cross-party politicians including Ed Miliband has demanded that the regulator launch an immediate review of whether James Murdoch meets such a test to hold a UK broadcasting licence. Given that James Murdoch is the chairman of Sky, Fox supporters believe there are no grounds for such a test. The report, Consolidating Control: the Fox/News merger and news plurality in the UK, also raises concerns about the \u201ceditorial independence of Sky News, one of only two British television news channels with an average monthly audience reach of 10 million\u201d. The coalition argues that Sky News online is the most widely featured news source on Yahoo\u2019s UK news page, accounting for more than 25% of articles in February 2017 and over 50% of headlines.",

Banks realised it was a moneyspinner. The Financial Conduct Authority has now disclosed that 64m PPI policies were sold to about 30m consumers between 1990 and 2010.

The industry\u2019s intransigence in paying out has spawned a vast claims industry: thousands of people are employed by banks to process claims in part fuelled by claims-management companies, which hassle on customers\u2019 behalf, and add to costs.

But I think it\u2019s a first where I can say that I used to have lunch with your grandfather in the members\u2019 dining room.\u201d<br></p> <p>Her grandfather was the late Quintin Hogg, second viscount Hailsham. Her father is Douglas, the third Viscount Hailsham and former Conservative MP and minister. Her mother Sarah \u2013 Baroness Hogg \u2013 is a former journalist and was head of John Major\u2019s policy unit.</p> <p>Tyrie\u2019s words tell us that Charlotte Hogg is part of the establishment. Do those words also show that public life in the UK is all too cosy? Or do they show that Hogg has the confidence to take on the big boys? Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the latter.</p>",

Everything\u2019s relative for Hogg Read these words Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, uttered some characteristically choice words last week when he took evidence from Charlotte Hogg, a newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England. \u201cI have over the years got used to doing business with people who are the sons and daughters of people I used to work with. But I think it\u2019s a first where I can say that I used to have lunch with your grandfather in the members\u2019 dining room.\u201d Her grandfather was the late Quintin Hogg, second viscount Hailsham. Her father is Douglas, the third Viscount Hailsham and former Conservative MP and minister. Her mother Sarah \u2013 Baroness Hogg \u2013 is a former journalist and was head of John Major\u2019s policy unit. Tyrie\u2019s words tell us that Charlotte Hogg is part of the establishment. Do those words also show that public life in the UK is all too cosy? Or do they show that Hogg has the confidence to take on the big boys? Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the latter.",

Power stations have been put on standby over the winter since 2014 as part of the National Grid\u2019s supplemental balancing reserve but the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) has found that the scheme, which closed in February, was never used.

Opponents of the bid have raised concerns that Murdoch, who also owns the rightwing Fox News, will use his influence to drive the news agenda, thereby risking the \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News. Murdoch critics have called for the bid to be blocked. Rival broadcasters are expected to lodge complaints and make representations in the UK and Europe \u2013 the European commission is also examining the deal \u2013 after expressing concerns that a Fox/Sky combination will dominate bidding for top-flight sport, TV shows and movies. Fox News, which is also broadcast in the UK, has fallen foul of the regulator a number of times through editorial lapses. Last year, Ofcom criticised a Fox News programme for breaching the UK code when a guest said Birmingham was a city \u201cwhere non-Muslims just simply don\u2019t go\u201d. Ofcom has already said that Fox taking over Sky\u2019s licence would warrant a \u201cfit and proper review\u201d. During its investigation following Murdoch\u2019s previous attempt to takeover Sky in 2010, it found that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence, despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled the now-defunct News Corporation, then parent of Fox and Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers. However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch \u2013 then chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky: \u2013 it found that his conduct repeatedly fell short of the standards expected. The political fallout ultimately resulted in Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his bidand James standing down as chairman of Sky and quitting the UK newspaper business to run Fox, the film and TV operation, from the US. Rupert Murdoch subsequently spun off the publishing and newspaper assets into a separate company, News Corp, and film and TV into 21st Century Fox, with independent boards, in part a corporate governance measure to facilitate another tilt at Sky. James Murdoch, chief executive of Fox, was reappointed last year as chairman of Sky. In October, he had to rely on the support of Fox, Sky\u2019s largest shareholder, to win approval for his return after more than 50% of independent shareholders voted against his reappointment. At the time of the last bid, the Murdochs agreed a deal to spin off Sky News to allay media plurality concerns. This time James Murdoch has said he does not believe any \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d will need to be made to get the deal through. In a letter to Bradley during the 10-day period she has had to review whether to refer the bid to Ofcom, Fox argued that in the six years since the aborted bid, the media landscape had changed beyond recognition. Fox said media plurality was flourishing with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post, while newspaper sales declined. Fox also argues that splitting the publishing and TV and film operations into two companies solves corporate governance, competition and plurality issues. Opponents argue, however, that the Murdoch family will still be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK and that that will give them too much control over UK news media. Fox has also pledged to keep Fox News at arm\u2019s length and \u201ccontinue to broadcast news under the Sky brand maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting code\u201d. \u201cWe are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Fox. \u201cThe media market has changed dramatically in recent years, as has our business. We believe our proposed \u00a311.7bn investment will benefit the UK\u2019s creative industries. We look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders and are confident that the transaction will be approved.\u201d Ofcom has set a deadline of 30 March for submissions relating to the Fox/Sky takeover. Nick Pollard, an Ofcom board member and former Sky News chief, has excused himself from the Fox investigation process. Pollard, who led the inquiry into the failure of BBC2\u2019s Newsnight to broadcast an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile, worked at Sky from 1996 to 2006. \u201cNick Pollard is recused from any involvement in the public interest test or fit and proper assessment to avoid any perceived conflicts of interest,\u201d said an Ofcom spokesman. The remaining eight members of Ofcom\u2019s board will make the final decision on the public interest test and fit and proper assessment.",

Or was he merely apologising to advertisers for the fact that some of their messages appeared alongside such offensive material?</p> <p>Brittin blurred the lines during his remarks on Monday but one suspects the advertisers were uppermost in his mind for three reasons. First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/19/google-braces-for-questions-as-more-big-name-firms-pull-adverts\">a boycott has been growing by the day</a> and Google will be desperate to avoid more corporate defections. Second, most of his points were about tightening the definition of sites deemed suitable for adverts. Third, Brittin refused several times to say whether Google would take the initiative and try to root out altogether offensive content on YouTube.</p> <p>Ambiguity on the third point is astonishing. As Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, put it in a letter to the company last week: \u201cIt is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/google-ads-extremist-content-matt-brittin\">Head of Google Europe apologises over ads on extremist content</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why won\u2019t Google commit clearly to being prompt and proactive? Brittin\u2019s argument, as far one can tell, is that it\u2019s difficult to police content instantly when 400 hours of video are being uploaded to YouTube every minute. But that is feeble. If Google was serious about tackling the problem it would allocate more resources, which it can afford to do, and stop relying so heavily on viewers to spot and report offensive material.</p> <p>Brittin promised Google would be \u201clooking again at how we improve what we\u2019re doing on enforcement\u201d with details to follow. Here\u2019s what a responsible organisation would do. Accept that it made a grave mistake in allowing hate material to be distributed. Explain what went wrong. Promise it won\u2019t happen again. Describe how the new practices will succeed where the current ones failed. Offer refunds to those companies and government departments whose adverts were placed alongside offensive videos produced by the likes of a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.</p> <p>Until those commitments are made, it is hard to understand why the irate advertisers would wish to risk a return to YouTube.

                "bodyText":"The first rule of making an apology is simple: be clear about what you are apologising for. Matt Brittin, head of Google\u2019s operations in Europe, failed the test. Was Google taking responsibility for allowing the company\u2019s YouTube site to be polluted with extremist videos produced by terror preachers and racists? Or was he merely apologising to advertisers for the fact that some of their messages appeared alongside such offensive material? Brittin blurred the lines during his remarks on Monday but one suspects the advertisers were uppermost in his mind for three reasons. First, a boycott has been growing by the day and Google will be desperate to avoid more corporate defections. Second, most of his points were about tightening the definition of sites deemed suitable for adverts. Third, Brittin refused several times to say whether Google would take the initiative and try to root out altogether offensive content on YouTube. Ambiguity on the third point is astonishing. As Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, put it in a letter to the company last week: \u201cIt is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content.\u201d Why won\u2019t Google commit clearly to being prompt and proactive? Brittin\u2019s argument, as far one can tell, is that it\u2019s difficult to police content instantly when 400 hours of video are being uploaded to YouTube every minute. But that is feeble. If Google was serious about tackling the problem it would allocate more resources, which it can afford to do, and stop relying so heavily on viewers to spot and report offensive material. Brittin promised Google would be \u201clooking again at how we improve what we\u2019re doing on enforcement\u201d with details to follow. Here\u2019s what a responsible organisation would do. Accept that it made a grave mistake in allowing hate material to be distributed. Explain what went wrong. Promise it won\u2019t happen again. Describe how the new practices will succeed where the current ones failed. Offer refunds to those companies and government departments whose adverts were placed alongside offensive videos produced by the likes of a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Until those commitments are made, it is hard to understand why the irate advertisers would wish to risk a return to YouTube.

                "bodyText":"The UK\u2019s official statistics office is looking into using traffic sensors, mobile photo data and satellite images as new ways of measuring the shape of the economy. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is opening a new data science campus at its headquarters in Newport, south Wales, on Monday as part of a \u00a317m investment in the way the UK collects and presents data. It will explore new ways of measuring the economy, including using traffic sensors to gauge activity, mobile phone data to track commuter patterns and satellite images to estimate populations. The ONS is under pressure to present more timely and broader insights into the economy following criticism that official statistics fail to capture the full picture of the modern lifestyle in Britain. A government-ordered review by the former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean last year called for the ONS to be more innovative and for economic statistics to be modernised. Number-crunchers at the new ONS hub have been tasked with harvesting information from the growing collection of big data that has been created by new technology and the internet. Tom Smith, managing director of the new campus, said: \u201cThere is a recognition at ONS that there is a real opportunity and a real need to step up our game in terms of the way we use those data sources and the techniques and the capacity that we have across ONS and across government. \u201cI want to take some of that expertise that is used to sell advertising in the commercial space and use that to understand the world for public and social good.\u201d The ONS will work with universities, governments, charities and businesses on developing its use of data. At the opening on Monday, data scientists and apprentices at the new campus will hear from the non-profit foundation Flowminder about how it uses satellite images and mobile phone data to map populations and track migration. Smith said the ONS could also use \u201cstreet level data\u201d, such as the images on Google Street View, to track economic activity. \u201cFor example, can we say from the imagery that we have what this neighbourhood might look like in terms of deprivation levels, poverty levels, what businesses and economic growth is happening there. That brings in again a very different data source,\u201d he said ahead of the launch. The ONS will not look at individual data from mobile phones, Smith added, but aggregated data from a collection of devices could be a useful source of information on the economy. \u201cMobile phone ownership and use during the day can tell you something about where people are moving to, so home-to-office migration patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also the amount the phone is used gives you something around economic usage indicators.\u201d Another international partner presenting to the ONS on Monday is its counterpart in the Netherlands. Statistics Netherlands will explain how it has used data from about 60,000 road sensors around the country. \u201cThey give you a minute-by-minute readout of the amount of traffic passing and they are using that as an indicator of what\u2019s happening in terms of patterns of economic activity,\u201d Smith said.",

                "bodyText":"Tribute bands are all the rage these days. So it should come as no surprise that the triggering of article 50 was marked by a homage to a band that toured the country in the summer of 2016: Project Fear. Project Fear 2017 has been playing its own versions of Beatles hits: I (Don\u2019t) Feel Fine, We (Can\u2019t) Work it Out and, of course, that all-time classic, While My Economy Gently Weeps. It has been quite a trip down memory lane to the days when the band\u2019s lead vocalist, George Osborne, was predicting immediate recession in the event of a Brexit vote. In the event, consumers carried on spending and the economy carried on growing. That\u2019s not to say everything is going to be plain sailing in the two years of negotiations that lie ahead. Nor is it to deny that Britain has some deep structural problems that badly need fixing. But it does mean treating with caution predictions that Britain will end up \u2013 as another 60s icon put it \u2013 on Desolation Row. That was the argument when Britain rightly declined to join the single currency in 2003 and it proved to be spectacularly wrong. It is not inevitable that the UK will suffer damage from Brexit. If the right decisions are made, the economy can flourish. This will be made easier if there is a free trade deal between the UK and the EU 27, but access to the single market is actually less important than making the right calls domestically. The idea that Brexit guarantees economic disaster is based on two assumptions, both questionable. Assumption number one is that Britain is leaving an EU that is doing well. That might have been true when the UK joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, but it is not the case today. Europe has taken longer to recover from the financial crisis than any other part of the developed world; four of its countries have needed emergency bailouts; one of its founder members, Italy, has seen living standards stagnate for two decades. Two European countries at either end of the continent suffered worst from the financial crisis: Iceland, which is not part of the euro, saw its banks go bust but is now booming; Greece has had a bigger and longer slump than that endured by the US in the Great Depression and is still on financial life support. The single currency, which has amplified the impact of the financial crisis for many member countries, is part of the story. But so is a lack of economic dynamism. Consider the companies that have emerged from nowhere to have a big impact since the single market came into being in 1993: Google, Facebook, ebay, Amazon, Uber. The common feature is that they are all American. Many of these companies have emerged from US universities, which fill 17 of the top 25 places in the world rankings compiled by the Times Higher Education.

                "bodyText":"Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take over Sky must be blocked because it would give him too much control of news media in the UK and he is not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner, according to a submission to Ofcom from the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the ex-business secretary Vince Cable. Miliband and Cable, outspoken critics of Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to take over Sky, have the support of the Labour peer and barrister Charles Falconer and of Tory father of the house Kenneth Clarke, who have put their name to the submissions. The media regulator is assessing whether the takeover of Sky raises plurality issues and whether under 21st Century Fox\u2019s full ownership \u2013 it currently controls 39% of the pay-TV company \u2013 broadcasting standards would be maintained. Ofcom, which has until 16 May to deliver its decision to the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, is also reviewing whether Fox is \u201cfit and proper\u201d to take control of Sky\u2019s broadcasting licence. Miliband, Falconer, Clarke and Cable \u2013 who was forced to hand over responsibility for assessing Murdoch\u2019s failed 2010 bid for Sky after telling undercover Daily Telegraph reporters that he was at war with the media mogul \u2013 have filed two lengthy submissions fleshing out their arguments against the deal. An accompanying letter said that while the submission on plurality concerns was \u201ccomprehensive and detailed\u201d \u2013 it runs to 61 pages \u2013 the argument against allowing Murdoch more control of UK news media was succinctly summed up by Lord Justice Leveson in his 2012 report into the culture, practices and ethics of the press. \u201cAll the politicians who gave evidence before the inquiry said that Mr Murdoch exercised immense power and that this was almost palpable in their relations with him,\u201d said Leveson. The letter said this evidence of the \u201cimmense and outsized power\u201d of the Murdochs was central to Ofcom\u2019s public interest test, which states that the media regulator must \u201cprevent any one media owner, or voice, having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\u201d. Fox\u2019s bid to snap up the 61% of Sky it does not already own would give Murdoch control of Sky News and pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. His ownership of UK news media also includes the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun as well as radio group TalkSport, which he controls through a separate company, News Corp. The letter asserted that \u201cthis would give them more control over the viewing and reading habits in our country than any other provider, apart from the BBC\u201d. The 33-page submission raised a catalogue of issues against Murdoch and Fox being fit and proper to take over Sky\u2019s broadcasting licence. \u201cWe believe on the grounds of fitness and propriety, this bid should be blocked,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe fitness test goes to the question of character and conduct. The record is one of persistent disregard for the law and regulatory control.\u201d During its investigation following Murdoch\u2019s previous attempt to take over Sky in 2010, Ofcom found that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence despite the phone-hacking scandal that embroiled the now-defunct News Corporation, then parent of Fox and Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers. However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch, then chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky, finding that his conduct had repeatedly fallen short of the standards expected. The political fallout ultimately resulted in Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his bid and James Murdoch standing down as chairman of Sky and quitting the UK newspaper business to run Fox, the film and TV operation, from the US. \u201cWe do not believe that Ofcom could be satisfied that Sky would remain a fit and proper licensee if this bid was successful,\u201d said the letter from Miliband, Cable and Falconer. \u201cIndeed, we contend that no reasonable Ofcom properly directing itself on the test it has to apply could come to this conclusion.\u201d Following the failure of the previous bid, Rupert Murdoch spun off the publishing and newspaper assets into a separate company, News Corp, and film and TV into 21st Century Fox, with independent boards, in part a corporate governance measure to facilitate another tilt at Sky. In a letter to Bradley during the 10-day period she has had to review whether to refer the bid to Ofcom, Fox argued that in the six years since the aborted bid, the media landscape had changed beyond recognition. Fox said media plurality was flourishing with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post, while newspaper sales declined. Fox also argues that splitting the publishing and TV and film operations into two companies solves corporate governance, competition and plurality issues. \u201cWe are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Fox. Opponents of the bid have raised concerns that Murdoch, who also owns the rightwing Fox News, will use his influence to drive the news agenda, thereby risking the \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News. Fox has also pledged to keep Fox News at arm\u2019s length and \u201ccontinue to broadcast news under the Sky brand maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting code\u201d.",
