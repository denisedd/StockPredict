Connor Campbell. financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm jobs report only made the week worse for cable, despite a rather unpleasant headline figure.</p> <p>The non-farm number itself was as ugly as they come. For the first time in 7 years the reading came in negative, at -33k against the 82k forecast and the (upwards revised) 169k seen in August. Yet while the figure was far worse than expected, it actually wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t <em>that</em> surprising given it covered a period impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.</p> <p>Instead of lingering on the shrinking non-farm payrolls, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention turned to rest of the jobs report. Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus.</p> <p>The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen...</p> <p>And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent.

Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December.</p> <p>So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable...</p> <p>Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since November 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures.</p> <p>Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports.</p> <p>This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and inflation is heading back towards target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. </p> <p>The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently easy monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse implications for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018.</p> </blockquote> <p>Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike.</p> <p>There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prodigal son\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: wage growth.

                "bodyText":"A stronger euro left European markets flagging, not helped by the continuing concerns about the stand-off between the Spanish government and Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence promoters. But with the pound suffering amid the latest political uncertainties in the wake of the Tory party conference, the FTSE 100 managed to edge higher by the end of trading, with its overseas earners benefitting from the prospect of a weaker sterling. A mixed bag for the US, with an unexpected fall in jobs balanced by a rise in wage growth, left Wall Street slipping back from record highs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.88 points or 0.2% at 7522.87 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.09% to 12,955.94 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.36% lower at 5359.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 22,392.31 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.29% lower at 10,185.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.10% to 745.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. A mixture of profit taking and concerns about oversupply have brought a rally in the oil price to an abrupt end. Hopes that producers would extend their agreement to cap output and reduce a supply glut have supported crude prices recently. But they have slipped back after Russia clarified that President Putin had not, as suggested, proposed extending the production cut agreement although he thought it was a possibility. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister also sounded lukewarm about an extension until the end of 2018, saying he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about it. Rising US crude exports have also been taken as a negative factor, along with the re-opening of Libya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil field. The approach of tropical storm Nate to the US Gulf coast is not helping matters either. So Brent crude is currently down 2.7% at $55.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 3.25% to $49.14. The pound continues to flounder against the dollar, both on worries about the political situation in the UK and of course, the strength of the US currency as the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December increases. At the moment the pound is down 0.53% at $1.3047, albeit off its worst levels. Connor Campbell. financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm jobs report only made the week worse for cable, despite a rather unpleasant headline figure. The non-farm number itself was as ugly as they come. For the first time in 7 years the reading came in negative, at -33k against the 82k forecast and the (upwards revised) 169k seen in August. Yet while the figure was far worse than expected, it actually wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that surprising given it covered a period impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Instead of lingering on the shrinking non-farm payrolls, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention turned to rest of the jobs report. Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus. The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen... And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent. And the thing is, there is no guarantee that next week will be any better, especially if the weekend papers are as filled with Tory infighting as one would expect. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the US jobs data. Dominic Rushe writes: The US jobs market stalled in September, losing 33,000 jobs, as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll. It was the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. The US economy had added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year but as the labor department had predicted the storms, which caused fatal and catastrophic damage across Texas and Florida, slowed hiring. But a loss in jobs was far worse than the 80,000 new jobs most US economists had expected would be created. It ends the longest stretch of uninterrupted jobs growth in US history. This was the first loss in jobs since September 2010. Ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report the Bureau of Labor Statistics said some 11.2 million workers lived in the affected areas, about 7.7% of the US workforce. Employment in food services and drinking places declined by 105,000 in September. That sector has added an average of 24,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. The unemployment rate, which was 4.4% in August, fell to 4.2%, a 16-year low. This is the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. In August the economy added 156,000 new jobs, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. The full story is here: After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have paused for breath. Despite the weaker headline jobs figure, the dollar has strengthened on the basis that higher than expected wages growth means the Federal Reserve may well raise interest rates before the end of the year. In turn, that has put a small dampener on equities. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 21 points or 0.09% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.25%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the jobs report data: The dollar has moved higher following the US jobs data, despite a fall in the headline figure. Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December. So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable... Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since November 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures. Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports. This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and inflation is heading back towards target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently easy monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse implications for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said: Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows. Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike. There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prodigal son\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: wage growth. This suggests the economy will grow at a strong pace in the last quarter of the year. Here is a chart showing clearly the impact on leisure and hospitality jobs: And here is the unemployment data and monthly changes: Other key figures from the non-farms report show the overall jobless rate fell unexpectedly to 4.2% from 4.4%. Pay growth was also better-than-expected, picking up to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August. Economists were predicting a smaller rise to 0.3%. The impact on jobs of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma was far greater than economists had predicted in September. The 33,000 fall in non-farm payrolls was the first drop in seven years after workers were displaced and firms delayed hiring. There was a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sectors. Employment in food services and drinking places fell by 105,000 in September, in an industry where most workers are not paid when absent from work. William Wiatrowski, acting commissioner at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, provided some context to the figures: In September, a sharp employment decline in food services and drinking places and below-trend growth in some other industries likely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The storms caused large-scale evacuations and severe damage to many homes and businesses. In the establishment survey, employees who are not paid for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month are not counted as employed. Many employees in areas affected by the hurricanes were likely off payrolls during the reference pay period for September. In September, 1.5 million workers had a job but were not at work for the entire reference week due to bad weather, the highest level for this series over the past 20 years. This series is highly sensitive to the timing of weather events and thus does not capture the immediate effect of all such events on the job market. Payrolls actually fell by 33,000 last month in figures just out, far worse than expected. Economists had predicted 90,000 jobs would be added. Figures for August were revised up to show 169,000 jobs were added (up from a previous estimate of 156,000). More soon... Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, is speaking about trust at the Royal Society of Arts in London. He says that in some ways, loss of trust in institutions is the very definition of a financial crisis, including the most recent one which has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely trust-busting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even as the scars of this crisis heal, this trust deficit might not repair itself naturally. The trust deficit that those in money and finance face may be not cyclical, not temporary, but structural and permanent. And if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, then those of us within financial services, including central banks, will really have to go some to repair that deficit. US non-farm payrolls for September are coming up at 1.30pm. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting the number of jobs added last month fell sharply to 90,000, from 156,000 in August, largely as a result of hurricane disruption. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has announced it is extending its investigations to other 2 Sisters poultry plants in England and Wales, as well as its scandal-hit West Bromwich chicken processing plant. It follows a Guardian and ITV News investigation that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. The FSA said that while it had not identified food safety issues at West Bromwich, the inspection \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highlighted issues requiring management attention, for example in relation to some aspects of staff training and stock control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Heather Hancock, chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said it was extending its investigation until it is satisfied that there is no risk to public health. Over in Greece pensioners have been protesting outside the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest administrative court against further cuts demanded by international creditors. It is the second such demonstration this week as anger mounts over the spectre of yet more cutbacks next year. Helena Smith reports. Gathering outside the Council of State, pensioners shouted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shame on you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as judges met to consider the legality of pensions being further trimmed back. Since the onset of the crisis in late 2009, pensions have been cut 12 times with unionists claiming some 1.5 million retirees are now living on less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 a month. The latest reforms would mean yet more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic reductions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier this week pensioners took to the streets in another show of anger, holding large banners deploring the cuts. With unemployment still hovering around 22%, families are often forced to survive on the pensions of elderly members. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis has hit retirees harder than perhaps any other age group. An estimated 22.2% of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely materially deprived\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unable to fend for themselves, or pay basic bills, according to the EU statistics agency, Eurostat. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item forecasting group, has analysed the UK productivity figures and says Brexit negotiations could further hold back progress: There is a risk that prolonged uncertainty may end up weighing down markedly on business investment and damage productivity. Prolonged difficult Brexit negotiations could increase this risk. This could also be compounded if foreign companies markedly reduce their investment in the UK, diluting any beneficial spill-over of skills and knowledge. Read our full story on the figures here: Easyjet is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 with shares down 2.7% this morning. The low cost carrier is down despite flying a record 24.1m passengers in the three months to September. The airline also said in a trading update that it was on track to make annual profits of \u00c2\u00a3405-\u00c2\u00a3410m, at the higher end of its guidance but below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3495m. Investors are also nervous about what the future holds, after chief executive Carolyn McCall said industry conditions remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this morning: A separate report from the ONS shows that the UK was less productive than the average among the G7 advanced economies in 2016. Output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average in 2016, compared with 15.5% below in 2015. The UK was however more productive than Canada and Japan: Britain was less productive between April and June compared with the previous quarter, with output per hour worked down 0.1%. It was dragged down by the manufacturing sector, where productivity fell in the second quarter by 1.3% according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile services sector productivity was up 0.2% over the period. Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, said the weak figures do not bode well for UK wages, which are already rising at a slower rate than prices: Poor productivity performance underpins the stagnation of real wages, and presents the government with a particular challenge since it appears likely that previous forecasts of earnings, and hence also of tax revenues, have been overoptimistic. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, has this take on developments in Spain and the implications for markets: The IBEX has been hit by profit taking as yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive bounce back was short lived. The decision by Madrid to suspend the Catalan parliament is a short-term solution to the problem, as the two sides are still locked in a stalemate. The Spanish government is in the process of making it easier for companies headquartered in Catalonia to switch their head office to another part of Spain. While Madrid is keeping the pressure on Catalonia, it is likely that dealers will steer clear of the Spanish stock market. Spanish equities and government bonds are underperforming other European markets after Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of foreign affairs said the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament would meet on Monday. It is in defiance of Madrid, after the the Spanish constitutional court suspended the Catalan parliament, threatening more tensions and instability. The Spanish IBEX is down 0.8% at 10,138, while yields on benchmark 10-year bonds were up seven basis points at 1.76%. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: Once again, the market has proved its resilience and confounded the doom mongers. Not that there is too much to get excited about with these figures which confirm what we have seen at the coalface recently - that prices are holding up reasonably well where vendors are realistic, partly in response to a continuing shortage of stock. Sadly, we are not seeing the hoped-for autumn bounce but a steady market is more than welcome with so much uncertain economic news. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is not convinced by the Halifax report: The sudden surge in Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of house prices\u00e2\u20ac\u201dup 3% over the last three months alone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis impossible to reconcile with all the other housing market evidence. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure is the most volatile of all the indices we track. Other surveys show that the pipeline of demand is soft; RICS has reported that new buyer enquiries have fallen in six of the last seven months. Real wages still have further to fall over the next six months and mortgage rates will rise soon in response to the increase in banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 funding costs. As such, we expect most of the pickup in Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index to unwind over the coming months. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says that a flight of equity from London is fuelling activity in the regions: In the current cautious market, prices treading water is good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stability plus gentle growth is very good. But momentum remains patchy and what growth there is is wavering rather than sustained, and prices remain under intense pressure in several key regions. In London, prices have been sliding in many of the areas that saw the frothiest rates of growth during the boom. On the flipside, the flight of equity from the capital is fuelling activity in several regional markets where affordability and perceived value for money is now enticing higher volumes of buyers. Halifax said UK house prices are partly being propped up by a shortage of homes on the market: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Annual house prices rose by 4% in September according to the Halifax price index. It was the strongest rate of growth since February, bucking the trend of other recent reports which have indicated a weakening market. Over the month, prices were up 0.8% reaching a record high of \u00c2\u00a3255,109, and smashing economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a 0.1% increase. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was also revised up to show 1.5% growth over the month, up from a previous estimate of 1.1%. House prices in the three months to September were 1.4% higher than in the previous quarter, the fastest quarterly increase since February. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax Community Bank: The annual rate of growth has picked up for the second consecutive month, rising from 2.6% in August to 4% in September. The average house price is now \u00c2\u00a3225,109 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest on record. UK house prices continue to be supported by an ongoing shortage of properties for sale and solid growth in full-time employment. However, increasing pressure on spending power and continuing affordability concerns may well dampen buyer demand. Investors and economists are increasingly betting that Bank of England policymakers will raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November. Galley says this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weigh on the housing market: There has been recent speculation on the possibility of a rise in the Bank of England base rate. We do not anticipate this will have a significant effect on transaction volumes. Wall Street hit fresh record highs on Thursday, with risk appetite among investors boosted by signs of a robust US economy. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.6% at 2,552.07. It was the sixth consecutive closing high for the first time in more than 20 years. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: A backdrop of strong economic data, optimism for corporate earnings in the third quarter and the recently released plan for tax cuts are fuelling the latest surge. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to revamp the US economy can live up to the hyped-up expectations but repeatedly fresh record highs indicate confidence not caution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty quiet in markets across Europe this morning, as markets await the main event at 1.30pm with the publication of the US non-farm payrolls report in September. Markets are feeling a little more relaxed about developments in Spain, where politicians in Catalonia do no seem able to agree on the best way forward. For now at least, that is helping to ease investor fears. In the UK the FTSE 100 is up just 9 points but is comfortably above the 7,500 mark, having gained 300 points in three weeks. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,517 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.02% at 12,971 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,371 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 22,476 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.4% at 10,177 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 390 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. The pound is under renewed pressure this morning as uncertainty builds over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future as Prime Minister. Grant Shapps, a Tory MP and a former party chairman, has admitted his role in a plan to put pressure on May to call a leadership election. He said MPs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfectly within their rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to call for a contest after May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gamble to win a bigger majority at the general election did not pay off. He told BBC radio 5 live: We did have a result that was not at all what anyone wanted, least of all what she wanted or anticipated, and... sometimes when things happen you have to take responsibility for them. This is a view I have held for quite some time and quite a lot of colleagues feel the same way, including five former cabinet ministers. The pound is down 0.4% at $1.3065. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest against the dollar since 7 September. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of dollar strength as traders bet on a December US interest rate rise. But the pound is also at a three-week low against the euro, down 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1169. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson gives this take: The pound has had another poor week its third weekly decline in a row, as concerns about political instability as well as disappointing economic data have undermined sentiment. seems likely that this discontent will once again amount to nothing more than hot air in the short term at least. The last thing the currency, the Conservative party and more importantly the country needs right now is the self-indulgence of another leadership battle. Also coming up today... 8.30am BST: September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halifax house prices report will provide the latest snapshot of the UK housing market. 9.30am BST: UK productivity figures for April to June. British productivity has been pretty dismal in recent years and policymakers believe improvement here is the key to unlocking stronger wage growth. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the latest. 1.30pm BST: The closely watched non-farm payrolls for September. Economists are predicting a sharp fall in the number of jobs added, to 90,000 in September, from 156,000 in August, as a result of hurricane disruption. The report will also give the latest insight into the pace of earnings growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy.",

Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. </p> \n   <p>Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. </p> \n   <p>However, as Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discount more rapidly early on. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db51c5e4b00593b4d681c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:39:33.231Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>(It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5188e4b00593b4d681c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:38:42.750Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e150180-3d83-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a\">an interview </a>with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) from last year.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5059e4b00593b4d681c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:37:22.172Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives\">From Obama to Cameron, why do so many politicians want a piece of Richard Thaler?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4f2ce4b076f91939cd10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:30:37.737Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account. They also have ideas about what is fair, and they can consider other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare in both a positive way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through cooperation or solidarity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a negative way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as through jealousy or malice. Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. </p> \n   <p>One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4ec7e4b076f91939cd0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:26:34.349Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaciorekMagda/status/917332227087831040\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\">Noblista Richard Thaler wyst\u00c4\u2026pi\u00c5\u201a w jednej ze scen filmu The Big Short.

He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><strong>Limited rationality:</strong> Thaler developed the theory of <em>mental accounting,</em> explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of <em>behavioural finance,</em> which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets.</p> \n   <p><strong>Social preferences:</strong> Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretical and experimental research on <em>fairness</em> has been influential. He showed how consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the <em>dictator game,</em> an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world.</p> \n   <p><strong>Lack of self-control:</strong> Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a <em>planner-doer model, </em>which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how <em>nudging</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term he coined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:55:03.398Z\">at 11.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4683e4b00593b4d68193\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:51:51.144Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thaler is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler\">professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago</a>.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db45c5e4b076f91939ccdf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:49:06.887Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:51:29.932Z\">at 10.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4595e4b00593b4d6818a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:47:45.560Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db1f31e4b00593b4d680ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:35:07.827Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-f_6zhUOPQ\"> \n   <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-f_6zhUOPQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:41:05.737Z\">at 10.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db3fa1e4b076f91939ccb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:21:40.819Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/917316544971067392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Turkey?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Turkey</a>'s lira is now the second-worst emerging currency this year. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRY&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$TRY</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7rJip0LSSp\">pic.twitter.com/7rJip0LSSp</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/917316544971067392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db38ece4b00593b4d6814d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:03:12.029Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish lira under pressure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground.</p> \n  <p>The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/us-suspends-handling-of-visas-in-turkey-after-arrest-of-consulate-staffer\">has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey</a> after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency.</p> \n  <p>The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sterling is using Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather severe losses.</p> \n   <p>One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond.</p> \n   <p>However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has eased some of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears.</p> \n   <p>Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone to US economist Richard Thaler for his work on behavioural economics. He plans to spend the prize money \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrationally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he told the awards committee. Here is our news story on the award: And here is an explanation of his speciality, behavioural economics: On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Thaler will be giving a news conference in Chicago later, and here are the details: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Lewis, author of the book The Big Short which was subsequently made into the film in which Richard Thaler appeared, on the new Nobel prize winner, from 2015. And here is Thaler and Selena Gomez in that very film: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Just over a year ago Thaler and fellow Nobel prize winning economist Eugene Fama took part in an interesting debate about whether markets were efficient or irrational. He also commented on Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech - not the parts that received the most commentary - but on her organ donor plans, in response to another tweet: Thaler has criticised the Brexit vote as a prime example of irrational behaviour. He told Business Insider just ahead of the UK referendum vote: Most voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really thinking about it in a very analytical way\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The people behind the leave campaign are voting with their guts. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no spreadsheet. This is much like a divorce without a prenup. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re voting to leave, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take care of all the financial details later. Thaler was apparently slow to wake up when the committee called him with the news of his award, but was unsurprisingly pleased with the news. His biography on the University of Chicago website lists one of his interests as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine wine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which will no doubt be part of a celebration later. His personal website is here but so far, no mention of the Nobel prize. Here is one of the committee members talking about Thaler, and explaining what behavioural economics is: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award: The 2017 Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to the US academic Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his contribution to behavioural economics. The prize, worth 9m Swedish kroner (\u00c2\u00a3845,000), is not among the Nobel Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official awards for literature, peace, medicine, physics and chemistry, but was established separately by Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in memory of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described Thaler as a pioneer of behavioural economics, which had progressed in recent years from a fringe and somewhat controversial field of research into a mainstream component of the economics profession. His research was praised for incorporating psychological assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. The prize-givers said his work had shown how the limitations of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge in the decision-making process, as well as the consequences of social preferences and a lack of self control, can affect people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions as well as market outcomes. Thaler, born in New Jersey in 1945, is a career academic and a Charles R Walgreen distinguished service professor of behavioural science and economics, and the director of the Center for Decision Research at the University of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Booth School of Business. He made a cameo appearance in the 2015 film The Big Short, sitting beside Selina Gomez at a blackjack table. He is a leading proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nudge theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a concept of behavioural science that suggests small interventions in the environment, or incentives, can encourage people to make different decisions. The full report is here: Here is the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on self-control: In the twelfth song of the Odyssey, Circe warns Odysseus about the Sirens, who lure sailors with their enchanting singing. Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. However, as Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discount more rapidly early on. (It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize). And here is an interview with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) from last year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote: When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account. They also have ideas about what is fair, and they can consider other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare in both a positive way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through cooperation or solidarity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a negative way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as through jealousy or malice. Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez: One of Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theories is about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mental accounting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The citation describes this as using different reference points to help make decisions, which vary from situation to situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One reference point could be the price for which we bought an item, or the lowest price we find when searching on the internet, and we use this reference point to assess whether we have made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In his research, Thaler has provided numerous examples of how mental accounting using differing reference points may lead to decisions that appear strange when evaluated from a traditional economic perspective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An example: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A consumer who finds out that the watch she is about to buy is 100 Swedish krona cheaper in another shop. She chooses to go to the other shop if the watch costs 1,000 krona but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do so if it costs 10,000 krona even though the saving in krona is the same. The explanation is that she focuses on the percentage, rather than on the actual saving relative to the reference point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research is here. The citation defines behavioural economics as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a research field in which insights from psychological research are applied to economic decision-making. A behavioural perspective incorporates more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions, providing new opportunities for designing measures and institutions that increase societal benefit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The committee is asked about the lack of women winners of the Nobel prizes, and the panel says they are concerned and they are taking measures to improve the situation. They think things will improve and hope it will be different in five to ten years time. Thaler is asked about the Chinese economy, but says he is not really an expert on that. And he is now gone. He is asked about his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short Hollywood career\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - he was in The Big Short - saying someone successful in something is assumed to be successful going forward, and how that could apply to Donald Trump. Thaler says he is disappointed his Hollywood career was not part of the official speech giving him the award. As for Trump, he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he would do well to watch that movie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked how he will spend the prize money, Thaler says he will try to spend it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as irrationally as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thaler is on the phone to the press conference now. He is asked what the most important aspect of his research is. He says it is the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that. The citation says Thaler has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes: Limited rationality: Thaler developed the theory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of behavioural finance, which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets. Social preferences: Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretical and experimental research on fairness has been influential. He showed how consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the dictator game, an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world. Lack of self-control: Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a planner-doer model, which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how nudging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term he coined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts. The committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thaler is professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog: Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground. The US has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency. The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country. Traders responded aggressively to the news, sending the Lira more than 6% lower against the U.S. currency - its steepest decline since 15 July 2016, when Turkey witnessed the bloodiest coup attempt in its political history. However, the Lira managed to recover more than half of its losses, as investors viewed the recent tensions as controllable. With Turkey increasing political ties with Russia and Iran, and Washington continuing to support Kurdish groups, the political risk premium is likely to keep pressuring the Lira. However, it would require far more escalation to see the currency trading near January lows of 3.94. Meanwhile the main Turkish stock market index, the BIST 100, has fallen 3.5%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something on the only woman to win the Economics prize: Here are some facts and figures about the Nobel Prize in economics: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s striking that only one woman has won the prize since it was first awarded in 1969. And if this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner is indeed one of the favourites, it will remain that way. Back with the pound, and the currency is shrugging off the latest Brexit worries and political problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling is using Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather severe losses. One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond. However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has eased some of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears. Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery. Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too enthused about the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell. The Eurozone indices were far perkier; the DAX hit a new high after climbing 0.3%, and is inches away from crossing 13000, while the CAC surged 0.5% to graze 5375. One notable mover in the markets in hotels group Millennium and Coptthorne. Its shares have soared 23% to 554p on news that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City Developments has offered to buy the shares in the group it does not already own. The move values M&amp;C at around \u00c2\u00a31.8bn. Given City Developments already indirectly owns 65.2%, a bid for the rest should not have come as too much of a surprise to the market, but still, the offer at 552.5p a share looks generous enough. European markets have got off to a mixed start. The FTSE 100 is down 0.06%, not helped by the slight strengthening of the pound which is not helpful to the overseas earners which dominate the index. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.2% and ouched a new all time high while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has edged up 0.1%. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 0.6% despite the continuing concerns about Catalan independence. Earlier German industrial output beat expectations, rising 2.6% in August compared to a 0.1% fall in July and forecasts of a 0.7% increase. But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cynical reminder about predictions about the winners: Indeed last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winners, Oliver Hart of Harvard, and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of MIT, were not top of the lists of likely recipients. My colleague Richard Partington has been looking at the runners and riders, who include the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and a string of US academics. His full report is here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mainly be concentrating on the annual Nobel prize in economics, due to be announced in a few hours in Stockholm. And first things first. It comes up every year, but just to be clear, the economics prize is not one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Nobel prizes like the literature and peace awards handed out last week. Officially it is known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. It was set up by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank) in 1968 and is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the same principles as the Nobel prize. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the biggest prize in economics, worth 9m Swedish kronor (\u00c2\u00a3848,091) and awarded in the past to illustrious names such as John Hicks, Jan Tinbergen, John Nash, and Joseph Stiglitz, 78 in all since it was established. Last year it was won by UK-born Oliver Hart of Harvard University and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their work on contract theory, covering a range of issues from executive pay to public-private partnerships. It comes at a time when economists, and experts in general, have been coming under increasing pressure with the rise in populism and the dismissal by some of their worth (step forward Michael Gove for one). But with the global economy still suffering the effects of the financial crisis and the likes of Wolfgang Schaeuble warning of the prospect of another bubble, there is still a need for expert economic analysis. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon see who is deemed to be top of the field at the moment. The announcement is due around 11.45am in Sweden, or 10.45am in the UK.... Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet start to the week. The pound is edging higher against the dollar after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines, while stock markets are expected to be rather subdued to start with:",

Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to call this the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max\">Mad Max problem</a>. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed?</p> <p>For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? </p> <p>The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process...</p> <p>To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity.

Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem.</p> <p>One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited.</p> <p>That sounds like a smart idea.

But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic.</p> <p>The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations).</p> <p>In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher....</p> <p>September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy.</p> <p>We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption. After all, the ISM manufacturing index is at a 13 year high, the dollar is making exports more competitive and we are seeing stronger global growth.</p> <p>With overall economic growth looking good, inflation pressures gradually increasing and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about asset valuations and financial stability becoming more prominent in speeches, a December rate hike is looking likely. The main risk remains the potential for an economically/market destabilising government shutdown.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e0b5cf611ed80722884a3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T12:47:51.119Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile US retail sales have bounced back in September, albeit just shy of expectations:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dmadden_CMC/status/918818493558116352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US retail sales MoM (Sep): 1.6% vs 1.7% expected, prior -0.2%<br>US core retail sales MoM (Sep): 0.5% vs 0.4% expected, prior -0.1%</p>&mdash; David Madden (@dmadden_CMC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmadden_CMC/status/918818493558116352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T12:49:11.175Z\">at 1.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59e0b39601a8e6075b954ab4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T12:43:12.167Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: inflation across America rose last month, but by less than expected.</strong></p> <p>Consumer prices increased by 0.5% in September, below the 0.6% which Wall Street expected.</p> <p>On an annual basis, US CPI rose by 2.2%, up from 1.9% a month ago.

                "bodyText":"An uncertain day for markets saw the FTSE 100 end lower after hitting a new closing peak on Thursday. A profit warning from GKN did not help, but the index was supported by a rise in mining shares following a surge in Chinese imports. On the other hand, sterling managed to maintain its positive mood against the dollar - with the US currency weakened by disappointing inflation numbers - which in turn undermined the overseas earners in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index. Conversely the more domestic focused FTSE 250 edged higher to another closing peak. In Europe the picture was mixed, while in the US, Wall Street moved higher despite a little uncertainty over a December interest rate rise following the inflation figures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 20.80 points or 0.28% at 7535.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.07% to 12,991.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.17% at 5351.74 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.07% 22,413.54 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.17% lower at 10,258.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 761.35 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Presented without comment: Back with Bitcoin, and a senior economist reckons the cryptocurrency faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mad Max problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Teunis Brosens, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank says: A core element of cryptocurrency is the lack of a central authority. Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to call this the Mad Max problem. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed? For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process... To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh. ...The cryptocurrency community is aware of the sheer energy consumption issue. Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem. One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited. That sounds like a smart idea. However, it implies that only those wealthy enough to be able to put resources in escrow can join the mining process. This creates a plutocracy, which sits uncomfortably with cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anarchistic and libertarian roots. My conclusion is that finding a sustainable and fair solution to the Mad Max Problem is one of the biggest challenges for the cryptocurrency community today. The US inflation figure was the main focus in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, and it came in below expectations: The dollar didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the hawkish data delivery it wished for this Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, not quite anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving (an admittedly tiny) slither of doubt surrounding the potential December rate hike. The afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad by any means. Retail sales saw a huge bounce from -0.1 to 1.6% month-on-month while consumer confidence hit its highest level since 2004. Yet those readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter to investors, who instead focused on the fact inflation rose from 0.4% to 0.5%, not the 0.6% forecast. With a the Fed constantly mentioning their concerns about weak US inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and how it imperils the chances of an interest rate rise before the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a miss the dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to indulge. Instead the greenback shed 0.2% against both the pound and the euro, while dropping 0.3% against the yen. This allowed the Dow Jones to continue its seemingly unstoppable march to daily all-time highs, with the index lurking just below 22900 following a 50 point rise. As for sterling, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a pretty inconsistent day. The currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managed to hold onto last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp rebound while struggling to maintain a steady grip on this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more modest growth. The inflation situation in the US allowed cable to keep above $1.33; against the euro, however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1265-crossing 9 day highs and sub-$1.12 lows, eventually settling just above that latter level with a 0.1% rise. More US data, and it looks like the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are in confident mood (see also the retail sales figures.) The monthly University of Michigan consumer sentiment index climbed from 95.1 in September to a preliminary reading of 101.1 for October. This is better than the dip to 95 which had been expected, and is the highest level since the start of 2004. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: The October gain was broadly shared, occurring among all age and income subgroups and across all partisan viewpoints. The data indicate a robust outlook for consumer spending that extends the current expansion to at least mid 2018, which would mark the 2nd longest expansion since the mid 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. While the early October surge indicates greater optimism about the future course of the economy, it also reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as it gets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times. ...Nothing in the latest survey indicates that consumers anticipate an economic downturn anytime soon - which contrarians may consider a clear warning sign of trouble ahead. Nonetheless, consumers anticipate low unemployment, low inflation, small increases in interest rates, and most importantly, modest income gains in the year ahead. It is this acceptance of lackluster growth rates in personal income and in the overall economy that signifies that consumers have accepted, however reluctantly, limits on the pace of improving prospects for living standards. The stronger US retail sales and hopes for positive company results have pushed US markets higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher to reach a new peak while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% to a record high. Not everyone believes a December US rate rise is a certainty, especially after this latest data. John Dolan, senior dealer at FEXCO Corporate Payments, said: In the space of just a week, all bets on a December rate rise are off and the US is further than ever from solving its inflationary puzzle. While a December rate hike had seemed a strong probability after last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid wage growth data, the picture now looks much more finely balanced. As this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC minutes revealed, the Fed remains deeply concerned about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation, or rather, the lack of it. Even though US wages are rising at a reasonable clip, consumer prices are still rising too slowly to require an immediate rate rise. Any December hike would therefore be driven by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to move rates back to more normal levels rather than by any inflationary imperative. While a final hike in 2017 remains a distinct possibility it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a done deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this uncertainty has weighed heavily on the Dollar, dragging it down against both the Euro and sterling. And from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on US inflation: More from the US Commerce Department on the retail sales: The dollar has weakened following the US data, in particular the inflation figures. But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank: Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic. The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations). In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher.... September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy. We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption. After all, the ISM manufacturing index is at a 13 year high, the dollar is making exports more competitive and we are seeing stronger global growth. With overall economic growth looking good, inflation pressures gradually increasing and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about asset valuations and financial stability becoming more prominent in speeches, a December rate hike is looking likely. The main risk remains the potential for an economically/market destabilising government shutdown. Meanwhile US retail sales have bounced back in September, albeit just shy of expectations: Newsflash: inflation across America rose last month, but by less than expected. Consumer prices increased by 0.5% in September, below the 0.6% which Wall Street expected. On an annual basis, US CPI rose by 2.2%, up from 1.9% a month ago. That puts it over the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of a 2% inflation rate. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like food and fuel, was flat at 1.7%. So, is bitcoin a sensible investment at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record levels, or should you keep well away? Cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many supporters will argue that City institutions are waking up to bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential (such as the ability to transfer money safely, securely, and cheaply worldwide). Two weeks ago, it emerged that Goldman Sachs has been considering whether to launch a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies. If that happens, it would arguably be the biggest endorsement yet from Wall Street. But critics argue that the recent rally is a bubble, that could burst if there is a rush to the exits. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investors, says anyone considering investing in digital currencies needs to be cautious: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The value of bitcoin has almost doubled in less than a month which is clearly attracting further interest from speculators. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of growing institutional activity, too, and if China reopens cryptocurrency exchanges after the Communist Party Congress which starts next week, some believe the price could reach $10,000 by the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there could be near-term turbulence around changes to the code the bitcoin network runs on, due to be implemented in mid-November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is crucial that retail investors understand the many risks involved in cryptocurrency trading, not least the volatility - bitcoin has lost more than a third of its value on two occasions since June. It is clearly not for the faint-hearted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pace of bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in recent weeks is quite remarkable. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quadrupled in value this year, despite faltering last month when China announced a crackdown on bitcoin exchanges. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been holding the World Bank to account at their Annual Meeting with the IMF in Washington: Bitcoin is having another one of those days. Having smashed through $5,000 for the first time yesterday, the cryptocurrency soared to $5,846 this morning before dipping back to $5,600 as I type. Last night, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said central bankers and regulators must take digital currencies such as bitcoin seriously, given the way they can disrupt the status quo. Many in the financial industry are struggling to come to terms with the rise of digital currencies, and unconvinced that bitcoin may be an unsustainable bubble. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan became the poster boy for the sceptics last month, when he declared that bitcoin was a fraud that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive. Yesterday he declined to take questions on the issue.... Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, argues that the blockchain technology which underpins bitcoin should be a useful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcutility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to improve the financial system operate. He told Bloomberg TV this morning: I can see that a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be useful in a blockchain context and speeding up interbank transactions. But, Sir Howard reckons that bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme volatility means it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a serious store of value for investors. UBS is also sceptical, saying bitcoin seems to be a bubble. But again, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re attracted to the blockchain -- the digital ledger that tracks digital transations. In a new report, they say: Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity since 2008, with more than 1,000 in existence today and an aggregate value greater than the market capitalization of IBM. But we are highly doubtful whether they will ever become mainstream currencies. The need for companies and individuals to pay tax receipts in government-issued currency, and the potentially unlimited crypto-money supply, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. We think the sharp rise in crypto-currency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble. But while we are doubtful cryptocurrencies will ever become a mainstream means of exchange, the underlying technology, blockchain, is likely to have a significant impact in industries ranging from finance to manufacturing, healthcare, and utilities. We estimate that blockchain could add as much as USD 300-400bn of annual economic value globally by 2027. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has been swept to a new alltime high today: China also hit a milestone for iron ore imports last month, as it bought more higher-quality stocks from abroad. Bloomberg has the details: Iron ore imports by China surged above 100 million metric tons to a record, smashing the previous high set in 2015, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerted push to clean up the environment stoked demand for higher-grade material from overseas while hurting local mine supply. Newsflash: Uber has filed an appeal against the decision to withdraw its licence to operate in London. The ride hiring app lodged its appeal in the courts this morning, ensuring that it can keep operating until the issue has been addressed. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judicial office has told Reuters that a heading could now take place on December 11, into Transport for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that Uber wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fit and proper company to operate in the capital. Today was the deadline for Ober to formally object to TfL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. An Uber spokesman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, Theresa May once again claimed the energy market was broken as she brought forward draft legislation for a price cap. But the big six suppliers, who have around 80% of the market, lost a record number of customers in September. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE collectively lost 163,000 customers over the month, up 127% on September 2016, analysis of official statistics showed. A significant chunk of those switchers would have been British Gas customers, prompted by the firm hiking electricity prices 12.5% for 3.1m customers. Experts at Jefferies bank said that with more than 1m people leaving the big six for challenger firms so far this year, 2017 will be a record year for switching. Next year could see that trend go into reverse, though, with households potentially lulled into complacency by the prospect of an upcoming cap. The FTSE 100 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sharing in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Stocks in London have dropped back from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, as the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery weights on exports. The Footsie is now down by 26 points at 7530. Other European markets are having a better day, though, helping to keep global stocks at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons shares could continue to climb. The bulls have the edge, and a strong US and European earnings should stand them into good stead for the rest of the year. Sterling is rallying this morning, thanks to signals that Britain and the EU might make progress in the Brexit talks. It has risen over $1.33 against the US dollar for the first time in almost two weeks, and is also recovering against the euro. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a turnaround from yesterday, when fears that talks had hit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeadlock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sent the pound sliding. That, though, was before it emerged that European leaders are expected to tell their negotiators to begin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal preparations for future trade talks with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says sterling is on a rollercoaster ride, thanks to a report that the EU are prepared to offer the UK a 2-year transitional deal. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly a fresh-take; a transitional period has been batted about since Brexit day dot. And [EU negotiator Michel] Barnier wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually that much of a doomsayer on Thursday, stating his belief that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was within reach in the next 2 months. But investors are being selective in what Brexit news they want to listen to, with this Handelsblatt report sending sterling sharply higher. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the Chinese economy seems to be in relatively good health, ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communist Party Congress. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data: The September Trade data painted an overall much stronger picture of domestic demand than many had been anticipating, and effectively made clear that the weaker August readings did not signal impending weakness. That said, some of the boost to imports was probably attributable to some front-loading of imports ahead of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Day/Autumn Festival holiday, with more working days this September probably also giving a boost. But the strength of commodity import growth (18.7% y/y) was across the spectrum, underlining the strength of domestic demand, and as much as Exports missed forecasts at 8.1% y/y, this was still a notable acceleration from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5.1%. The oil price has jumped this morning, as the markets react to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18.7% surge in imports. Brent crude has jumped by 1.5% to $57.07 per barrel, with traders anticipating higher demand for energy. Other commodity prices are also rallying, with nickel hitting a one-month high. Iron ore and copper are also up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade with North Korea slumped in September, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data, in a sign that United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang are being implemented. Chinese imports from North Korea fell by almost 38%, including imports of iron ore and coal according to customs spokesman Huang Songping. Chinese exports to North Korea also fell, by 6.7%. More details here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data might irk Donald Trump. According to Reuters, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the US has hit an all-time high. Reuters reports: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States in September rose to $28.08 billion versus $26.23 billion last month, Chinese customs data on Friday showed. The surplus was the highest ever with the U.S. for any single month, based on Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jan-Sept trade surplus with the U.S. was $195.54 billion, the data showed. That could give fresh ammunition to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has long complained that the trade imbalance between the two nations hurts the U.S. economy. The strong Chinese trade data sent MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All-Country World Share index up to a new peak, at 494.84 points. The index, which tracks equities across the globe, has been rising steadily this year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are touching new record highs this morning, after new Chinese trade data indicated the global economy was strengthening. China smashed forecasts overnight, reporting that imports surged by a remarkable 18.7% per year in September. Exports rose by 8.1%, a little below forecasts but still a solid result. The leap in imports suggests that Chinese factories are continuing to see strong demand for their products; an encouraging sign for world growth. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers will be pleased, as they prepare for next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communist Party Congress. This also means that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has narrowed, as Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capital, shows here: Chinese government officials have hailed the data, saying it shows the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is on track. CNBC has the details: Huang Songping, spokesman for the Customs department told a press conference on Friday that trade for the first three quarters improved due to a recovery in overall global and domestic economic environment. There has been a return in global demand, he added. Barring unforeseen events, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will post double-digit growth in foreign trade this year, said Huang. Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, called the data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems the global demand is still there to support the demand for Chinese exports.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees, saying: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data was fairly supportive of a fairly robust domestic economy. Asian stock markets rose to a 10-year high following the data, while Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei struck at 21-year high: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 joined the party last night, hitting a new record closing high. That was partly down to a weaker pound, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 also hit a new high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story: The Times also gave it a good show: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda for the day: 1.30pm BST: US inflation data for September. Prices are expected to have risen by 0.6% during the month. A strong reading raises the chances of a US interest rate rise. From 2pm BST: The IMF and the World Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Annual Meeting continues. Central bank chiefs, finance ministers, economists and investors will bd discussing the state of the global economy 3pm BST: The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer confidence report. 6pm BST: The weekly Baker Hughes oil rig count. A good measure of whether oil producers are ramping up output, or cutting back We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also have an eye on Bitcoin, which smashed through $5,000 to a record high yesterday.",

It says there is evidence that the SFT gave private lenders generous deals, paying them interest at rates much higher than the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lender for public sector projects, the Public Works Loan Board. Very few of the companies designated as primary contractors or the banks lending them money were Scottish, which could undermine the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and private sector, the report says. In addition to the 42 projects that are under way, there are dozens of smaller PFI-type projects still in the pipeline, expected to cost at least a further \u00c2\u00a31bn overall. Audit Scotland, the public spending watchdog, has begun a formal inquiry into the SFT after it emerged that the quango made serious errors when it designed the new private financing models covered by the Cuthberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report. The SFT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schemes breached European Union rules designed to prevent governments from claiming that public sector building projects were not government assets because they were built and owned by private firms. That meant the building costs of many PFI projects had to be added to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books. Investigations by the Guardian showed this error meant the Scottish government had to set aside about \u00c2\u00a3932m to cover the building costs of five projects, including the Aberdeen bypass, three hospitals and the new blood transfusion headquarters. The financiers for one of those hospitals, in Dumfries, south-west Scotland, will earn \u00c2\u00a337.5m in interest for \u00c2\u00a324.2m in lending, at an interest rate of 11.3%. In a similar case involving a project to redevelop the Royal Edinburgh psychiatric hospital, the Guardian and the Ferret website have found that its backers are charging 10.75% in interest for part of the borrowing needed for the first phase of the project. The companies are involved in building, financing and maintaining it will earn \u00c2\u00a3116m by 2042 on facilities that cost \u00c2\u00a338m to build. The devolved government defended its programme, insisting the SFT had produced \u00c2\u00a3924m in savings and benefits since it was launched, without specifying what those were. The SFT \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enable[s] investment in public projects in Scotland to be brought forward more quickly than would otherwise be available through our capital allocation and limited borrowing powers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a spokeswoman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They also balance future operational and maintenance risks between the public and private sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added that Holyrood was given six-monthly updates on SFT projects, the system had been endorsed as efficient and effective by the Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance committee and had been given a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean bill of health\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Audit Scotland, which has covered SFT projects in reports on general government spending.",

                "bodyText":"The Treasury secretary, John Fraser, has expressed optimism that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-low wages growth could have bottomed out as wages pick up in some pockets of the country. But he has admitted Treasury officials were caught off-guard by the extent of the wages slowdown since the global financial crisis, saying the economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the crisis have run deeper than expected in Australia. Nigel Ray, the deputy secretary of Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic group, has also revealed that someone has lodged a freedom-of-information request to get their hands on internal Treasury \u00e2\u20ac\u0153analysis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has been promoting in recent weeks but refusing to release publicly. Morrison told the Business Council of Australia last month that Treasury had found, in specific analysis, that wages were growing slowly across most industries in the economy, and most regions of the country, which demonstrated that income inequality was not growing in Australia. Excerpts of Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BCA speech were printed in a story in the Australian newspaper the morning before his speech, along with details from the unreleased Treasury analysis. Ray said on Wednesday that Treasury had not given its analysis to anyone in the media \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it had only given its analysis to Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. Fraser told senators that there were signs Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers could soon enjoy real wages growth, after years of stagnating wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would welcome wages growth to get back to something like the longer-term norms,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m encouraged, actually, that there are signs of it. I rely very heavily on the heads of Treasury group and at the meeting we had in Adelaide there were pockets, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to over-egg this, there were pockets or signs of wages growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And in the consultations we did as part of the report for the Council on Federal Financial Relations later this week we saw pockets also where there were increased wages demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in construction in Victoria, there are signs in the semi-skilled area in north-west Sydney and, interestingly, in some of the regional centres for construction workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As I said, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to over-egg it but I think it is starting to pick up a little. That has been the experience overseas as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fraser said that, as with business investment, it was clear many workers had been shaken by the experience of the GFC, adding Treasury was caught off-guard by the protracted slowdown in wages growth after the crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scars of the GFC probably run deeper and broader, and rawer, than we expected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fraser said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know a lot of people in the farming sector, for instance, they still feel it. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The construction sector, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly the case with tradies and whatever. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t uninvented the business cycle but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly a much longer business cycle that, in my experience, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overall, he said the economy was evolving broadly in line with Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations in the 2017-18 budget. The International Monetary Fund earlier this month said Australia was among countries with the highest growth in income inequality in the world over the past 30 years. Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of fiscal affairs, told an audience at the launch of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Fiscal Monitor that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income inequality growth has been similar to the US, South Africa, India, China, Spain and the UK since the 1980s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most people around the world live in countries where inequality has increased,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gaspar said.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed higher - but Spain has bucked the trend as the Catalan crisis escalates further. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is still under negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Far from being a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ceiling of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1bn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would characterize last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amazon September results as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPicasso-like quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, as it shows America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the last quarter came from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rate hike is fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Kohl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad sales. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s durables release). Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet day... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.15am BST: Peter Praet, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, speaks a a conference on financial market policy in Frankfurt. 1.30pm BST: US GDP report released.",

It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police\">holds UK property in offshore companies</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/egregious-loophole-property-capital-gains-tax-close-foreign-owners-commercial\">This egregious tax loophole costs the UK \u00c2\u00a38bn every year.

These problems are continuing.</li> </ul> <p>Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing<br></p> <ul> <li>The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly.</li> <li>Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment.</li> <li>The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc.</li> <li>We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018.</li> </ul> <p>Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill.</li> <li>We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers.</li> </ul> <p>Machinery Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly.</li> </ul> <p>Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry.</li> </ul> <p>Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits.</li> </ul> <p>Printing and Related Support Activities </p> <ul> <li>The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode.</li> <li>We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months.</li> </ul> <p>Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date.

This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income.</p> <p>Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding).

                "bodyText":"In an uncertain day ahead of a busy week, the Spanish stock market bucked the trend and jumped sharply on hopes that the Catalan independence crisis could be resolved. A positive set of GDP numbers for the country also helped sentiment. Elswhere the FTSE 100 slipped lower, as its overseas earners reacted badly to a stronger pound, which moved higher ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting where the first interest rise in a decade is widely expected. On Wall Street the latest developments in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election saw markets slip back. There was also talk that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long awaited tax reforms may only be gradual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00c2\u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmonth/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153head for the exits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial price declines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primary driver of inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally, a chart showing why \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash for clunkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery weak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit by \u00c2\u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent growth figures this morning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00c2\u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00c2\u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00c2\u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpreadsheet Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 and 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchypothecated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given all the current pressures and uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the policy action that these might require \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasingly intense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very tricky hand indeed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. The \u00c2\u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00c2\u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00c2\u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00c2\u00a370 billion) in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00c2\u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit is on track to still be \u00c2\u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as much as the \u00c2\u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwriggle room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",

                "bodyText":"Positive eurozone economic data in the form of strong third quarter growth figures and falling unemployment meant a fairly positive end to the month for European equities. Most markets managed to close higher, although Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was closed for a public holiday. In the US, investors were more focused on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting than upbeat consumer confidence figures, but Wall Street still managed to make slight gains after an uncertain start. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.27 points or 0.07% at 7493.08 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.18% better at 5503.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was up 0.18% at 22,793.69 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.74% better at 10,523.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.12% to 759.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 17 points or 0.08%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The continuing dispute between Spain and Catalan separatists should have no immediate effect on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign debt ratings, says S&amp;P Global. The agency said that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly application of Article 155 [removing Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional government from office] and the frontloading of regional elections have reduced the likelihood of a short-term escalation of tensions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said it did not believe Catalan independence would take place: As we expected, no national government has recognized Catalonia as an independent state. The most prominent credit risk we continue to see is that the related tensions could lead to a sustained drop in business and consumer confidence and potential business disruption from fourth-quarter 2017 onward, especially in Catalonia. While the economic consequences of these developments have yet to emerge, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic data were positive. In third-quarter 2017, GDP growth remained robust at 0.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest level since 2008. This confirms our expectation of Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong economic performance. US markets are more focused on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting than the positive data we have seen today. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite a very good afternoon for data the Dow Jones and dollar were reticent to do much this Tuesday, investors holding back ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed statement. The CB consumer confidence reading smashed expectations, coming in at 125.9 against the 121.1 forecast and the 120.6 seen in September (itself revised higher from the initial estimate). The Chicago PMI was also pretty muscular; at 66.2 it hit its best level in around 3 years. Yet off the back of these numbers the Dow Jones could only rise 0.1%, while the greenback actually fell 0.3% against the pound. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely because investors are a bit nervy ahead of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting. While a December hike seems pretty much locked on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the CME Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FedWatch tool pointing to a 98.2% chance of a rate rise in the festive month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the market will still be looking for a firmly hawkish statement from Janet Yellen on Wednesday. Elsewhere the FTSE saw its daily gains shrink to just 0.1% as the afternoon wore on, leaving the index once again the wrong side of 7500. Sterling, on the other hand, stretched its legs against the euro, doubling its growth to 0.4%, while cable climbed back above $1.325, as investors continue to focus on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE rate vote. Over in Greece, and there is some good news for the country from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone jobs figures. Helena Smith reports: Greek unemployment dropped to 21 % in July [the latest data available] according to the European statistics agency (Eurostat), with the number of jobless Greeks at 1.01m. Of that number 17.5 % were men and 25.3 percent women, it said. At the height of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis four years ago, unemployment nudged 28 % spurring a massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of qualified Greek abroad. The jobless rate among those under the age of 25 also dropped from 43% in June to 42.8%. Meanwhile, well-placed finance ministry officials say the government is also planning a second foray into the bond market possibly as early as next month, before Greece completes a third bailout review with the international bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. News of the prospective foray, in effect a second test run, would prepare Athens for exit from its current bailout programme which expires in less than a year. Greece successfully put its toe back into bond market for the first time since 2014 in July but analysts insist that real economic recovery will only come when its staggering debt pile is ultimately tackled. More on the UK crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals in bookmakers shops. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report from Rob Davies: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob on BBC Radio Scotland talking about the issue (from about 49.45). US investors seem to be playing its safe ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite further upbeat trading statements from the likes of Kellogg and Mastercard, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down 0.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite has slipped 0.01%. European markets are generally flat too, although Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up another 0.5% as fears over the Catalan independence threat continue to recede. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax meanwhile is closed for a holiday. On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased to its highest level in almost 17 years (Dec. 2000, 128.6) in October after remaining relatively flat in September. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions improved, boosted by the job market which had not received such favorable ratings since the summer of 2001. Consumers were also considerably more upbeat about the short-term outlook, with the prospect of improving business conditions as the primary driver. Confidence remains high among consumers, and their expectations suggest the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace for the remainder of the year. These positive US figures come as the Federal Reserve holds its latest monetary policy meeting, and while no rise in interest rates is expected this month, all the signs point to an increase in December. (By then we should also know the name of the next Fed chair, with Donald Trump set to announce his appointee sometime this week.) Over in the US, and consumers were more confident than expected in October. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index came in at 125.9, better than the 121 figure forecast by analysts. It was also higher than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 120.6, itself revised upwards from 119.8, and the best level since December 2000. Earlier there were also positive manufacturing figures from Chicago. The purchasing managers index rose from 65.2 in September to 66.2, better than the expected fall to 61. Right, time for a quick recap.... The Eurozone is on track to grow faster than America and the UK this year, after reporting better-than-expected growth figures over the last quarter. Eurozone GDP grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, faster than expected and beating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% growth. On an annual basis, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5% during the last quarter - which is its fastest rate since the first three months of 2011. Economists say the recovery seems to be strengthening. In another boost, the eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.9%, as the expanding economy helped people to find work. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, says British businesses should look for growth opportunities in the euro area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is easy for businesses to fall into the trap of over-cautiousness when the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own growth rate is slower, but capitalising on Eurozone successes now will help companies to secure their future. Businesses can and should be doing as much as they can to drive up productivity and activity through positive investment in both people and assets, taking advantage of positive economic conditions to help them navigate successfully through times of uncertainty, and emerge in a position of strength.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The day began with solid growth figures from France, which grew by 0.5% during the last quarter. Like the wider eurozone, France racked up its best annual growth since the early days of the euro debt crisis (when Greece was being bailed out and the Italian government was faltering). It grew by 2.2% compared with Q3 2016, while the UK only grew by 1.5% over the same time. Experts say France moved into a higher gear. Domestic demand drove the growth, with household spending and business investment both up. Austria also had a decent summer, expanding by 0.8%. Canada, though, seems to be slowing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDO shrank by 0.1% in August, after stagnating in July. Hello..... sterling is suddenly pushing higher against the euro. The pound has gained almost 0.5% against the single currency to a one-month high of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. This follows reports that the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, ha said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to speed up negotiations with the UK. Newsflash: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy unexpectedly contracted, a little, in August. Canadian GDP shrank by 0.1% in August, due to a decline in mining and manufacturing output. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good-producing sector shrank by 0.7% during August, wiping out a 0.1% rise in service sector output. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.1% in August, having been flat in July as the strong growth recorded earlier this year has faded. Unless something remarkable happened in September, Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 growth rate is going to struggle to match other advanced economies. That has hurt the Canadian dollar, which is now falling against the US dollar. High street retailer John Lewis has fuelled worries about UK consumer spending, by posting its fifth weekly fall in sales in a row. Takings at John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores fell by 4.0% year-on-year in the seven days to Saturday 28th October. That includes a 1.9% drop in fashion sales, and a 7% slump in sales of electronics and home technology. Last week, the CBI warned that retailers were reporting the biggest drop in demand since the recession.... Not only is the eurozone enjoying faster growth than Britain, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also experiencing less inflation. The consumer prices index, which tracks the cost of living, rose by just 1.4% per annum this month, according to new data released this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 1.5% in September. In contrast, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate hit 3% in September, and the Bank of England expects it kept rising in October. So with inflation down, unemployment down and growth up, the eurozone does look rather healthier than a few years ago: It may be Halloween, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing scary in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone growth figures, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index: Eurozone growth is pretty broad-based right now, adding weight to the argument that the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is well entrenched. Spain, for all of its political woes related to Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for independence, posted a 3.1% GDP rate for Q3, while France saw growth beat expectations and reach 2.2% for last quarter. We are still waiting to hear about growth rates in other major nations such as Germany and Italy, if they can post rates around this level then the mood music in Brussels is likely to be good. The eurozone economy is benefitting from strong domestic demand, thanks to record low interest rates, says Raj Badiani, director at IHS Markit: Households are experiencing a more supportive climate, characterized by still-cheap credit, while lower-than-expected inflation rates have limited the anticipated squeeze on household purchasing power during second and third quarters. Additionally, still-rising employment and a retreating unemployment rate have lifted both household confidence and spending across the region in the first three quarters of 2017. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve plotted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth figures alongside the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own GDP figures, to show how Europe powered ahead this year. The long-awaited fall in eurozone unemployment is helping to drive growth this year, says Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ulster Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists say the eurozone recovery is stronger than expected: Ben Chu of the Independent shows how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate overtook the UK a year ago: Philip Shaw of Investec thinks the eurozone could outpace America this year, as well as the UK. (last week we learned that US GDP grew by 2.3% over the last 12 months, so a little slower than the eurozone). The eurozone has just posted its fastest annual growth rate since the beginning of the debt crisis, partly due to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance. That means the eurozone has outpaced Britain this year, as UK GDP only expanded by 1.5% over the last 12 months (as explained at 7.32am). Breaking! The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stronger reading than expected. In another boost, growth in the second quarter has been revised up to 0.7%, from 0.6%. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 2.5% -- a healthy rate, which underlines that the European economy has enjoyed quite a sparkling 2017. The latest unemployment figures also show an improvement -- the euro area jobless rate has dropped to 8.9% for September, the lowest since the start of 2009. Newsflash: Fashion chain Burberry have just announced that its chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, is leaving. Thats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only three months since Bailey relinquished the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair to Marco Gobbetti, a move that was meant to allow Bailey to focus on creative matters. Bailey has received wide acclaim over the years for transforming Burberry into a global fashion house, so this could be a blow to the company. As chairman Sir John Peace puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christopher is a unique talent and an exceptional person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who has worked as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great partner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the firm. Shareholders may be concerned. Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 2% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard..... In other news, the UK government has outlined its plans to protect gamblers from fixed-odds betting terminals. Under the plan, the maximum bet could be cut from \u00c2\u00a3100 to just \u00c2\u00a32 (or possibly to \u00c2\u00a350, which seems rather less radical).... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart, which suggests France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has shifted into a higher gear: Barclays economics team agree, saying: We think the French economy is poised to grow solidly next year, projecting 1.9% (consensus: 1.7%), with investment likely to provide increasing support to private consumption, the main growth engine. Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global chief investment strategist, is concerned that the UK is lagging behind other advanced economies such as France. He believes Brexit uncertainty is weighing the economy down, meaning Britain faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctough slog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Turnill says: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muted growth outlook stands in stark contrast to 2016, when the UK sat close to the top of G7 growth charts alongside Germany. Brexit negotiations in particular are weighing on the UK economy. Significant progress on three key issues is needed for discussions to move on to the post-Brexit trade relationship between the UK and European Union (EU): the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial obligations to the EU, and the Irish border. Progress has been made in recent weeks on these issues, but not enough to advance talks, the EU leaders concluded at their recent summit. Reuters have a good first take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French growth figures, for anyone just tuning in: The French economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous three months as consumer spending picked up and investment remained robust, the INSEE national statistics agency said on Tuesday in a first estimate. The result, which was spot in line with a Reuters poll of 27 analysts, meant gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 2.2% over a year, the fastest pace of growth since 2011. Upward revisions in the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year - both by 0.1 percentage point to 0.6% - gave a growth carry-over of 1.7%, the performance for 2017 if growth was zero in the final quarter. Following the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over the first nine months, President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government should have little trouble surpassing the 1.7% growth forecast it built its budget plans on. Barclays have also hailed France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth performance: Newsflash: Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of this year. That matches the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the second quarter, and is a pretty decent result. It means Austria is growing as fast as Spain (and rather faster than both France and the UK). WIFO, the think tank which compiled the report, says the recovery is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad-based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with foreign trade and domestic demand both growing. On an annual basis, Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is motoring along nicely with 2.6% growth. Holder Sandte, economist at Nordea Markets, believes France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic economy strengthened over the summer: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is fresh confirmation that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has outperformed the UK this year French GDP grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017, then 0.6% in Q2, and then 0.5% in Q3. In contrast, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only expanded by 0.3% in the first and second quarters of this year, rising to 0.4% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate, at 2.2%, is so much better than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.5%. INSEE says that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate, of 2.2%, is the strongest since 2011 -- when the eurozone debt crisis was exploding. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Deen is impressed by France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over the last year: Economist Fred Ducrozet, of Swiss bank Pictet, agrees that the recovery is on track: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics reckons that Paris is now going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoe to toe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Berlin in the growth stakes: (reminder, we get German GDP on 14th November) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that French household spending accelerated in the last three months, from 0.3% to 0.5%. Businesses also kept spending on new machinery and equipment; \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rose by 0.8% during the quarter. Inventory changes also boosted growth,as firms stocked up on new raw materials and components. But, foreign trade was a drag on growth. Imports accelerated sharply (+2.5% after +0.2%) while exports decelerated significantly (+0.7% after +2.3%). INSEE says that France imported more transport equipment during the quarter, but sold fewer manufacturing goods abroad. BREAKING: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fifth quarter of growth in a row, as the French recovery continues to gather pace. Consumer spending and business investment drove French growth during the quarter, says statistics body INSEE. In another boost for president Emmanuel Macron, the growth rate in the second quarter of 2017 has been revised up to 0.6%, from 0.5%. The French economy has grown by 2.2% over the last 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest annual growth rate since 2011, I think.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also rather stronger than the UK, which only grew by 1.5% over the last 12 months (and 0.4% in the third quarter). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull details and reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European politicians and top officials will be hoping to avoid any Halloween shocks today, as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy comes under the microscope. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone GDP day, when we find out how fast Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continued in the third quarter of 2017. Economists predict that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth rate dipped to 0.5% in Q3, from the almost-boisterous 0.6% recorded in April-June. If so, that would beat the UK, which grew by 0.4% in the same period. As well as the headline eurozone growth figure, at 10am GMT, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting data from France and Austria. Alas, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until next month for other heavyweights like Germany and Italy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen some signs that Europe did well in the third quarter - yesterday, Spain posted 0.8% growth in the last three months. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all.... we also get new eurozone inflation and unemployment figures this morning. This splurge of data should give us a good picture of how the economy is faring. Later today, Canada also posts growth figures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also going to be a busy morning for airline news, with budget operator Ryanair and manufacturer Airbus both reporting results. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are expected to open fairly flat, as traders watch for political drama in America following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictments of three of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former aides: October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good month for shares, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Despite the fallout from a new series of political surprises across Europe, the Teflon rally that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen since the beginning of the year shows no signs of slowing down apart from the occasional pause, with markets across Europe set to post significant gains in another good month for stocks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for the third quarter of 2017 8am GMT: Austrian GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone flash inflation rate for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for September 12.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP for August",
