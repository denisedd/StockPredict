                "bodyText":"And finally.... European stock markets mostly ended the day higher, although Spain was dragged down by worries over how Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for independence may develop. In London, the FTSE 100 closed 66 points higher at 7,438, a rise of 0.9%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gained 0.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC rose by 0.4%. But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX had a bad day, losing 1.2% following Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violent clashes over the disputed Catalan referendum. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Spanish stock market is suffering after the violent images and footage that were broadcasted around the world yesterday of the Catalonian independence referendum. The use of force by police officers shocked viewers around the globe, and the heightened tensions in the region have prompted investors to cash in their positions. Opinion polls in advance of the referendum suggested that the pro-independence side were in a minority, but I suspect Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions will drive up calls for independence. The political uncertainty is weighing on their stock market, and until the situation is solved, traders will be wary. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, reckons the tensions gripping Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party have helped to drag the pound down today. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has not been a Monday to remember for the pound, and the remainder of the week poses further challenges to the UK currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming manufacturing PMI reading could well spur a sell off, while Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premiership is coming under increasing scrutiny, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to leave the pound losing further ground. That scrutiny has been fuelled by foreign secretary Boris Johnson, with a series of interviews and speeches in recent days that have challenged May over Brexit. Yesterday, the PM was even asked whether Johnson was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunsackable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, following claims that he was actually trying to get the boot -- either to bolster support for a future leadership challenge, or simply because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to make ends meet on his ministerial salary (a mere \u00c2\u00a3140,000....). The US economy appears to be romping ahead, if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM factory survey is any guide. Capital Economics explain: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index to a 13-year high of 60.8 in September, from 58.8, is the latest illustration of the benefit to the manufacturing sector from the weaker dollar and strong global demand. The index is now, at face value, consistent with GDP growth surging above 5% annualised in the second half of this year. Over in Greece the government has tabled its first draft of the 2018 budget, in which its projects a primary surplus target of 3.5%. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Presenting the draft before the House, alternative finance minister George Chouliarakis called it the last budget Greece would experience under international supervision. Chouliarakis declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is clear that this will be the last budget under a [bailout] program\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The draft, which is expected to be voted on this December, foresees the debt-stricken country not only achieving a primary surplus of 3.5% next year (high by any standards) but a GDP growth rate of 2.4%. Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government has said it want to make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean exit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to markets its third international bailout programme expires next August. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has been shored up to the tune of more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn since its near economic collapse in 2010. Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories also had a good September. Activity grew at the fastest rate in 16 months, sending the Mexico manufacturing PMI up to 52.8 last month, from 52.2 in August. The jump in US factory growth is helping to keep Wall Street at record highs today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 74 points, or 0.3%, to 22,479. The rally is led by Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble and Goldman Sachs, who have all gained 1%. This chart from Danske Bank shows how US manufacturing has strengthened in recent months (according to ISM, anyway). Wow! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has posted its fastest growth in 13 years. The Institute for Supply Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing activity index jumped to 60.8 in September, from 58.8 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth. This is the fastest acceleration in 13 years, and it suggests that the US economy ended the last quarter strongly. Firms reported that new orders accelerated last month, encouraging them to take on more staff and boost production. But.... companies also experienced a big jump in material costs (as we also saw in the UK earlier). This upbeat message is backed up by Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival US PMI index, released a few minutes ago. It also rose last month, but to a more modest 53.1. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has posted another month of solid manufacturing growth. The Canadian factory PMI has risen to 55.0, up from 54.6 in August. Factory bosses reported that output and new business growth both jumped in September, with job creation also up. Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing survey is out....and it shows that the sector expanded a little in September. The Brazilian factory PMU came in at 50.9, matching August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level, which indicates slow but steady growth. Sterling has just hit a three-week low against the dollar, down 1%, or 1.3 cents at $1.3265. The pound has also shed 0.5% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.128, as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory slowdown continues to weigh. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: Sterling got off to a rough start during Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session after weaker than expected data from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector, suggested that the economy could be losing momentum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into the worst day for the pound since early June - after the last general election. Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK boss, Jo Bertram, has stepped down to do something \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new and exciting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd instead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the ride-hailing firm fights to retain its licence to operate in London. More here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party conference week! And chancellor Phillip Hammond has tried to excite delegates in Manchester by extending the Help to Buy scheme. Hammond announced that the government will provide an extra \u00c2\u00a310bn to the scheme, which lets people get a loan from the government to help buy a newly build house. This will let the scheme run until 2021, Hammond said, meaning it can help an estimated 130,000 more homebuyers over the next few years. Marvellous stuff! Except, some experts reckon Help to Buy is a deeply flawed idea that pumps up house prices rather than tackling problems with supply. After all, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t build more houses, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll simply have more people chasing the ones on the market. Sam Bowman, Executive Director of the Adam Smith Institute, gave the scheme a serious hoofing, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reviving Help to Buy is like throwing petrol onto a bonfire. The property market is totally dysfunctional because supply is so tightly constrained by planning rules, and adding more demand without improving the supply of houses is just going to raise house prices and make homes more unaffordable for people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t qualify for the Help to Buy subsidy. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest housebuilders have jumped this morning, with Persimmon gaining 3.7% and Barratt up 3.5%. City traders have worker out that Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new cash injection will boost their profits..... Sterling has made a poor start to October, falling almost one cent against the US dollar to $1.3296. The slowdown in UK factory growth last month didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the pound, as it has stirred concerns over the health of the wider economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The market never appreciates signs of a slowdown, especially when they are likely linked to the thick fog of uncertainty still surrounding Brexit. Tomorrow we get a healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector, followed by the big one - the services PMI - on Wednesday. Kathleen Brooks of City Index suspects that these surveys may be underwhelming. We expect the rest of the surveys to also show signs of moderation as the UK economy enters a period of slow cooling rather than falling off a cliff. There is another factor, though. The US dollar is strengthening, on rumours that the next head of the US Federal Reserve could be Kevin Warsh. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen as more hawkish than Janet Yellen, the current Fed chair, so could raise interest rates more aggressively. Nicholas Megaw of the Financial Times makes a good point about the PMI -- UK firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receiving enough support from the weak pound. He writes: This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey showed less benefit from the pound, with fewer firms reporting a boost to overseas demand while more reported an increase in cost inflation. Input price inflation hit a six-month high, with higher commodity prices and supply chain pressures also driving up costs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory survey: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers slowed the pace of output in September amid a rise in production costs linked to the weak pound. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity fell to 55.9 last month from 56.9 in August, as the cost of goods used in the production process increased to a six-month high. Although the reading was below City expectations, the figure is still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. But the survey of purchasing executives in more than 600 industrial companies points to weaker growth in the UK economy. Rob Dobson, the director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While the report showed gains in new orders to be slower than in the prior month, companies reported that demand remained solid in both domestic and overseas markets. But the rising cost of commodities, and the weak pound pushing up the price of other raw materials, damaged optimism in the industrial sector. Scotiabank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alan Clarke said the figures were disappointing but far from a weak reading on the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the big scheme of things, this is reasonably in keeping with what we have seen over the past year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. More here: Over at Luton airport, passengers who hoped to fly with Monarch Airlines today have been scrambling to find alternative flights - or going home disappointed. One was Mark Henson, 50, from Dover. He arrived at the airport at 4am for the same flight to Portugal, and was told it had been cancelled. He told Press Association: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We got told to go home: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help you so you may as well go home.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He told me I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be be able to get a flight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Henson was able to book two seats on a flight on Monday evening but said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scandal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that prices on other airlines were so high. He accused companies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153money-making\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd out of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somebody else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The slowdown in factory growth may be partly due to Brexit uncertainty. Bosses will be reluctant to buy expensive new machinery until they know what trading conditions they will face from 2019. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, says firms needs clarity: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers across a range of sectors, particularly steel and oil and gas, are cashing in on sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the last year while the UK continues to reap the benefits of the Single Market. However, businesses are not committing to long term investments and the flip side of the weaker pound is that increased input costs are weighing down on margins. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The promise of a transition deal has provided reassurance, but manufacturers are calling for negotiations to progress quickly on trade and EU workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights to settle the nerves on the availability of qualified overseas employees and new investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too gloomy about UK manufacturing. The sector has now racked up 14 months of growth in a row, having shrunk immediately after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, says UK factories are struggling to meet orders because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve failed to invest in new equipment: Emerging problems in the supply chain, signalled by lengthening lead times, are likely related to the subdued investment performance of the past few quarters. Companies will only satisfy some of their capacity needs through additional recruitment which needs to be complemented with higher capital spend on productivity enhancing investment. With the demand outlook holding up, government action in the forthcoming Budget to spur companies to commit to investment in the UK will be a priority.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, some UK factories are struggling to deliver their orders in time due to supply shortages, according to the PMI report. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest news this month is the fall in the productivity of manufacturing supply chains as suppliers lost the fight to keep on top of promised delivery times and their performance weakened to the greatest extent for six-and-a-half years. The blame lay squarely at the feet of capacity constraints and some commodity shortages in food, but also other materials such as plastics and steel. British factories will probably be forced to pass their higher raw material costs onto consumers, which could push UK inflation even higher. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, warns: With cost pressures remaining elevated and margins being increasingly squeezed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before manufacturers raise prices which will likely impact the domestic demand that has been fuelling growth in the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in the UK factory PMI in September suggests Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is losing momentum, warns Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest PMI survey showed a modest deceleration in the rates of expansion in UK manufacturing production and new orders. Although it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy. Exports remain a bright spot, however, still rising at one of the strongest rates over the past six-and-a-half years. Dobson also warns that rising commodity prices and the weak pound will continue to drive import costs up. That will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dent profitability and potentially disrupt production schedules in coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Just in: UK factory growth slowed last month, as Britain failed to match the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI , which measures activity across the sector, fell to 55.9 in September, from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 56.7. That is weaker than the City expected, and shows that the sector expanded at a more modest rate. Encouragingly, the survey found the new exports remained solid. Data firm Markit says: Growth of new export business remained among the best registered over the past six-and-a-half years. There were reports of increased sales to Europe, the USA, China and Brazil. Some firms also mentioned an ongoing boost from the historical weakness of sterling, although this was less prominent as a factor than earlier in the year But firms were also hit by higher costs, with input price inflation hitting its highest rate since March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to rising commodity prices and the knock-on impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall last year (which is still rippling through the economy). Reaction to follow.... Breaking! The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has posted its best month since early 2011. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, whose euro area factory PMI has jumped to 58.1, the highest in six and a half years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 57.4, and shows that the sector grew strongly (any reading over 50 shows an expansion). Factory bosses reported that new orders piled in last month, mainly from overseas customers. That encouraged them to take on new staff, at the fastest rate since Markit started tracking the sector two decade ago. The recovery was pretty broad-based too, with Germany and the Netherlands recording the strongest growth. Encouragingly, Greek factories also reported growth, at the fastest rate in almost a decade. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, reckons the recovery could continue for some time.... The eurozone manufacturing boom kicked into an even higher gear in September..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surging order book growth has encouraged manufacturers to take on extra staff at a rate never previously seen in the 20-year history of the PMI survey. Despite this expansion of capacity, backlogs of incomplete work built up at a faster rate, suggesting that the hiring upturn has plenty more room to run. Over in Madrid, shares have fallen following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum in Catalonia, and the violent clashes between Spanish police and those trying to take part. Catalonian president Carles Puigdemont has indicated that the region could declare independence after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll, even though the vote had already been declared illegal by Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional court. Catalan officials say 90% of votes were cast in favour of independence, although the turnout was only 42.3% [it might have been higher if Spanish police hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupted the vote, dragged people out by the hair and fired rubber bullet at crowds protecting poling stations]. With the next step uncertain, bank shares led the selloff in Spain - knocking almost 1% off the IBEX index. Spanish government bonds have also been hit, pushing the gap between Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to a four-month high. The Unite union has accused Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsitting on its hands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and allowing Monarch to fail. Monarch needed help due to terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, which encouraged more rivals to compete on its Spanish roots. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decimation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the tourist trade in Turkey was another crucial factor. But Unite argues that Monarch could have kept flying if ministers had given it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbridging loan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to cover the cost of restructuring its business. After all, Angela Merkel provided Air Berlin with credit lines in August when it fell into insolvency, preventing its collapse. National officer Oliver Richardson says Britain should learn from Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s example: Continuing uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the ability of UK airlines to fly freely in Europe after the UK has left the EU undoubtedly hindered Monarch getting the investment it needed to restructure and survive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This uncertainty, combined with the apparent unwillingness of the Government to assist at commercial rates and at a profit to the taxpayer, has left thousands of jobs at a great British airline hanging by a thread. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now is not the time for Government ministers to wash their hands of a problem they have contributed to. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to act fast by intervening in a similar way as their German counterparts did with Air Berlin and help secure a future for Monarch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhappy demise is good news for its rivals, including Ryanair, which is going through its own crisis right now (having cancelled flights due to a lack of pilots). Shares in easyJet have jumped by 5% at the start of trading, while BA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, IAG, are up 2%. Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share are up over 3%. Following Monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse at 4am, the Civil Aviation Authority is now conducting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest ever peacetime repatriation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in UK history. Two flights from Ibiza have already landed this morning, at Gatwick and Birmingham, but that still leaves over 100,000 people abroad. Anyone who arrives at a UK airport hoping to fly with Monarch Airlines will be disappointed today: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A on what they should do: UK manufacturers fear they could lose \u00c2\u00a317bn per year in European sales if Britain leaves the EU under a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a new report from top law firm Baker McKenzie, which examines the implications of Britain defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules. It found that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Automotive, Technology, Healthcare and Consumer Goods businesses would all suffer if new tariffs were imposed. Crucially, those four sectors export almost half their products to the UK; while the UK accounts for just 9% of exports from the EU. That implies Britain would suffer more than the UK under a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario. But can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Britain just export more to China, the US, Korea, etc?... ....Yes, but this report reckons that UK exports to five key markets need to increase by 60% to offset \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 EU export loss. Baker McKenzie Trade partner Jenny Revis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures indicate the extent to which the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key manufacturing sectors are likely to be hit by the impact of a hard Brexit. You can understand why there is now mounting pressure for the UK to negotiate new customs arrangements for post Brexit trade with the EU and for companies to work with their industry groups to help shape future trading relations with the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report also questions whether German car makers, for example, would push chancellor Angela Merkel to give the UK a good Brexit deal (as some commentators claim). While Britain does buy a lot of German cars -- Britain is simply a less important market to Europe than Europe is to Britain, as this chart shows: This may give Brussels the upper hand in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, warns Ross Denton of Baker McKenzie: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have heard a lot about how much Europe exports to the UK, for example, in the automotive sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That may be true in numerical terms, but when you look at this as a percentage of their trade, you can clearly see that the EU exports a lot more broadly, to a whole host of other markets, and consequently, it is far less dependant on the UK as a market than the UK is on it. This will have significant implications for upcoming negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories performed last month, as data firm IHS Markit publishes its health check on manufacturers across the globe. Economists expect the UK factory PMI to drop to 56.2, from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 56.9. That would indicate that growth slowed a little but remains solid (anything over 50 shows growth). Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says the figures could hit sterling. The pound will be making headlines as well as the PMI figures from all 3 sectors of the domestic economy are pending for release over the next few days. Today the release of the Manufacturing figures will set the stage and analysts are expecting a softer reading which could dampen expectations for a stronger pound in October. The British currency saw a strong performance during September following renewed bullishness from the Bank of England that suggested that a higher interest rate policy might be needed to arrest the rallying inflation. A flurry of PMIs from across the world will also show how the global economy fared in September. The other big news this morning is that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth-biggest airline, Monarch, has collapsed overnight leaving 110,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest collapse of a UK airline ever, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, and means 300,000 bookings have also been cancelled. The UK is now scrambling to arrange new flight to get people home. The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are putting together, at very short notice and for a period of two weeks, what is effectively one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest airlines to manage this task. The scale and challenge of this operation means that some disruption is inevitable. We ask customers to bear with us as we work around the clock to bring everyone home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European traders will also be watching events in Spain closely, following the disturbing scenes of violence in Catalonia yesterday Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for September 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for September 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment report for August 2.30pm BST: Canadian manufacturing PMI for September 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for September",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US economy looks in great shape based on recent surveys, supporting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message that everyone needs to prepare for a higher interest rate environment.</p> <p>If you though Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM manufacturing index was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highest reading for 13 years, the non-manufacturing ISM index is astonishing. It has jumped from 55.3 to 59.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest reading in 12 years.</p> <p>Admittedly this jump is partly down to a rebound from the recent hurricanes but the strength clearly evident in the details of the report underlines the point that the US corporate sector is in great shape. A strong domestic economy is driving output and new orders while a fairly soft dollar and strong global demand are boosting exports.</p> <p>The non-manufacturing survey shows business activity jumping five points while new orders jumped six points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index has only been higher on two occasions in the past twelve years. Employment is also looking very strong at 56.8 versus the 50 break even level, which gives us confidence to assert that any softness in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls report relating to hurricane effects will be swiftly reversed in coming months.</p> <p>As such today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report reinforces our view that the only thing stopping a December hike is the potential for debt ceiling issues coming to a head, risking a government shutdown around year-end. Inflation wise, the price paid component indicates that the decline in inflation rates seen through this year will soon come to an end and the Fed is right to assert that disinflation was merely transitory.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d4f3bce4b076f91939b59c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-04T14:44:41.926Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on what the latest ISM surveys - manufacturing and non-manufacturing - say about the strength of the US economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeoffHall/status/915584702337175553\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With a PMI of 60.8 and an NMI of 59.8, the synthesized total-economy ISM index was 59.78 in Sep, fourth highest in survey&#39;s 20-year history. <a href=\"https://t.co/m5lWOc61tv\">pic.twitter.com/m5lWOc61tv</a></p>&mdash; Jeoff Hall (@JeoffHall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeoffHall/status/915584702337175553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d4f138e4b0c8da8831b992\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-04T14:35:31.099Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks fall by more than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude inventories dropped sharply last week, and by significantly more than expected.</p> <p>They fell by 6.02m barrels to 464.96m, compared with expectations of a 0.8m decline.

Combined with the further upturn in price pressures seen in September, the survey data will further fuel expectations that the Fed will be keen to hike interest rates again before the year is out.

                "bodyText":"With stronger than expected services data from the US, Wall Street shrugged off an early dip and continued on its merry way to new records. It was a different story in Europe, with a more mixed picture. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged to a new peak but France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac slipped back, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex dropped sharply in the wake of the Catalan crisis confronting the country following the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.53 points or 0.01% at 7467.58 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.53% to 12,970.52 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.08% lower at 5363.23 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.44% to 22,456.38 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 2.85% at 9964.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.23% to 750.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 32 points or 0.14%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 look at the global economic picture as evidenced by recent surveys: In the markets, the standout performance came from Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex, and not in a good way. Following the weekend violence surrounding the Catalan independence referendum, there is little sign of a resolution to the dispute between the region and the central government. So the Ibex has ended down almost 3%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus has been relentlessly on the situation in Spain, where Catalonia is seemingly headed for a declaration of independence. As a result, the Ibex remains under heavy pressure, with the index now down 11% from its highs. Geopolitical risk is back on the agenda, with investors shunning Spanish stocks in favour of their German counterparts, as the Dax returns to all-time high. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Ibex 35 has fallen to a mark not seen since March as the uncertainty surrounding Catalan independence is eroding investor confidence. The head of the Catalan separatist movement has pledged to declare independence for the region within days. The Spanish King and Prime Minister oppose this, and the region has been threatened with direct rule. The eyes of the world are on Catalonia and the spike in political tensions is likely to keep investors away. US interest rates are likely to rise in December given the strength of recent data, says ING Bank chief international economist James Knightley, barring a failure to resolve the debt ceiling problems. He said: The US economy looks in great shape based on recent surveys, supporting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message that everyone needs to prepare for a higher interest rate environment. If you though Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM manufacturing index was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highest reading for 13 years, the non-manufacturing ISM index is astonishing. It has jumped from 55.3 to 59.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest reading in 12 years. Admittedly this jump is partly down to a rebound from the recent hurricanes but the strength clearly evident in the details of the report underlines the point that the US corporate sector is in great shape. A strong domestic economy is driving output and new orders while a fairly soft dollar and strong global demand are boosting exports. The non-manufacturing survey shows business activity jumping five points while new orders jumped six points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index has only been higher on two occasions in the past twelve years. Employment is also looking very strong at 56.8 versus the 50 break even level, which gives us confidence to assert that any softness in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls report relating to hurricane effects will be swiftly reversed in coming months. As such today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report reinforces our view that the only thing stopping a December hike is the potential for debt ceiling issues coming to a head, risking a government shutdown around year-end. Inflation wise, the price paid component indicates that the decline in inflation rates seen through this year will soon come to an end and the Fed is right to assert that disinflation was merely transitory. More on what the latest ISM surveys - manufacturing and non-manufacturing - say about the strength of the US economy: US crude inventories dropped sharply last week, and by significantly more than expected. They fell by 6.02m barrels to 464.96m, compared with expectations of a 0.8m decline. But gasoline stocks grew by more than expected, up 1.64m barrels rather than 1.1m. But there may be some divergence between the survey and the official data, suggests Nordsea economist Johnny Bo Jakobsen: Anthony Nieves, ISM chair, said: The non-manufacturing sector has reflected strong growth in the month of September despite the impact on the supply chain from the recent hurricanes. Respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments indicate a good outlook for business conditions. And here are some comments from the survey: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricane Irma caused a revenue challenge that will take some time to recover from, interrupting business operations in that region and offsetting growth in others.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business continues to grow at a good pace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153General outlook looking up, with sales picking up. That will drive spend and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Information) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, consistent growth in construction/office renovation jobs. Eight percent more jobs and 6 percent more revenue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Positive business trends continue in second half. Business results above plan and higher year-to-year. Forecast above planned results for 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business still in a down trend due to lack of capital investment in worldwide mining market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Mining) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricane Harvey has been a disruption to normal business activity in the oil and gas industry. Refineries and petrochemical plants were shut down due to the storm, as were many offices along the Gulf Coast. Business is just now returning to some sense of normalcy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued growth; however, slower pace than in past. Expecting some further disruptions due to weather in Texas and Florida.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Retail Trade) In contrast, the Institute for Supply Management service sector survey has come in much stronger than expected. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI for September was 59.8, up from 55.3 in August and higher than the 55.5 expected by analysts. This is the highest level since August 2005. The new orders index jumped from 57.1 in August to 63. Commenting on the survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Given the disruption caused by recent hurricanes, some pull-back in business activity was understandable, so the resilient reading of the September services PMI makes for encouraging reading. Looked at alongside the manufacturing PMI, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised rate of just over 2% in the third quarter. Growth is largely reliant on the services economy, however, as manufacturing lags behind, struggling in part due to the strong dollar. While rebuilding and a return to normal business conditions after the hurricanes will hopefully boost growth in the fourth quarter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying to see business expectations about activity levels over the coming year drop in September. Measured across both manufacturing and services, future optimism is at its lowest since February, suggesting companies have become increasingly cautious about the outlook. However, while optimism has slipped, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey data on recent output, new orders and hiring trends remain solid. Combined with the further upturn in price pressures seen in September, the survey data will further fuel expectations that the Fed will be keen to hike interest rates again before the year is out. Average prices charged for goods and services rose at the fastest rate for three years in September, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not yet clear how much of the rise reflected short-term hurricane effects. The first of two US service sector survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shows a better than expected outcome, although a slight decline on the previous month. The Markit final service sector PMI for September came in at 55.3 compared to an initial reading of 55.1, but down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 56. There was a similar pattern for the composite PMI, up from an initial 54.6 to 54.8 but down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.3. As expected the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened marginally lower, but soon regained positive territory. The Dow fell 3 points initially after its record breaking run, but is currently up 9 points as investors await the latest service sector data. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.14% lower. The non-farm payroll numbers will probably be below the ADP figures, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Meanwhile in America, the latest jobs figures have beaten expectations. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, a report from payroll processor ADP showed that US private employers added 135,000 jobs in September. This was above the Reuters forecast of a rise of 125,000. The increase came despite hurricane Harvey and Irma, although the report did show smaller retailers were hit hard by the storms. If the non-farm figures also come in above estimates, that will give more credence to a possible US interest rate rise before the end of the year. The better than expected data is not set to help Wall Street, however, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open slightly lower after its recent record breaking run. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housebuilders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reacted to another Theresa May announcement - an extra \u00c2\u00a32bn for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affordable housing programme. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably because the plan will only make a small dent in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing shortage, by building an extra 5,000 social rented homes a year. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy providers are sliding, after Theresa May told the Conservative Party conference that the government will introduce a new price cap Centrica, which runs British Gas, has shed 6% , while SSE are down 3%. That sends Centrica down to its lowest level since early 2004. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics liveblog has more details (including the astonishing sight of a comedian handing May a P45 during her speech, and a lot of interruptions for coughing as the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice faltered). Back in the City, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may not be strong enough to support an interest rate hike, especially with Brexit looming. In a new report, S&amp;P argues that the Bank of England has been talking up the idea of rate rises soon, to stop the pound sliding. S&amp;P says: We remain a bit skeptical as to how justified such a hike would be in the near term. One rate rise may come in November, but further increases aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justifiable given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak wage growth, S&amp;P argues: Overall, we believe the Bank and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent statements are primarily aimed at propping up sterling to reduce imported inflation pressures. This strategy may include an actual 25 basis point hike in November, thus bringing the policy rate back to where it was before the Brexit referendum. Additional moves in 2018 do not appear warranted on the back of a slowing economy. S&amp;P also warns that there is a high risk that Britain suffers a disruptive Brexit. It points to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tangible lack of progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in talks with Brussels and the ongoing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infighting within the U.K. political establishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Inequality Ana Arendar has welcomed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling against Amazon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cosy deals that let companies slash their tax bills show how the global tax system is open to abuse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate tax avoidance robs countries around the world of billions each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c money that could be used to fight poverty. Poor countries are hit hardest as they are more dependent on tax revenue from companies to pay for public services like life-saving healthcare and clean water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Governments need to tighten tax rules to ensure companies pay their fair share of tax. In the meantime, the UK Government should not delay implementing laws to require British multinationals to publically report their activities for each country where they do business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Jennifer Rankin on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state aid decisions: Amazon has been ordered to repay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m (\u00c2\u00a3222m) by EU authorities, after a ruling that the technology company benefited from illegal and unfair state aid from Luxembourg. The European commission also announced on Wednesday that it planned to take the the Irish government to the European court of justice (ECJ) over its failure to collect \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in unpaid taxes from Apple, in relation to an earlier ruling. Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner in charge of competition, said Luxembourg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal tax advantages to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had allowed almost three-quarters of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits to go untaxed, allowing it to pay four times less tax than local rivals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an illegal practice under EU state aid rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vestager said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Member states may not grant selective tax concessions to multinational groups to which other companies do not have access.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The commission said Amazon had benefited from an illegal tax deal granted by the Luxembourg authorities that allowed the company to artificially reduce its tax bill by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m from 2006 to 2014. The company has been ordered to repay the full amount plus interest. Amazon rejected the findings of the commission investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jennifer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry says the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to take it to court is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Dublin insists that it is making significant progress in recovering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of taxes from Apple, even though it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with that ruling. Q: Are you concerned that there could be a proliferation of sweetheart tax deals in the UK after Brexit? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why the situation would change, Vestager replies. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it now, why have it later? She argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political direction and administrative practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd determine what kind of tax system a country runs. Luxembourg has issued a statement, arguing that Amazon did not benefit from state aid (as the EC claim): Luxembourg has taken notice of the decision by the European Commission in the Amazon case. Luxembourg will use appropriate due diligence to analyse the decision and reserves all its rights. The decision of the Commission refers to a period going back to 2006. Over time, both the international and the Luxembourg legal frameworks have substantially evolved. As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible State aid, as foreseen by article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Luxembourg has been fully cooperating with the Commission in its investigation and is strongly committed to tax transparency and the fight against harmful tax avoidance. Luxembourg fully adheres to the OECD/G20 BEPS project, which modernizes international tax rules and creates a global level playing field. Q: Can member states claim some of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m tax bill for themselves? Vestager suggests this is unlikely (ie, because the money should have been paid to the Luxembourg tax offices). Q: Could today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions make member states more worried that the EC is interfering in their tax affairs? Vestager says she hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard this sort of complaint. Member States understand the importance of an effective tax system in the world of digital commerce and large multinationals. Amazon has rejected the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that it illegally avoided paying enough tax in Europe, and may appeal. In a statement, it says: We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: The US government is considering changing its tax rules so it can tax the trillions of dollars which are currently parked overseas by American companies. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your advice for them? Vestager declines to advise the US government on this issue. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focused on getting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax system to work properly. Q: How did Amazon evade tax in Luxembourg, if it was recording revenues there? Vestager explains that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating company was paying unacceptably high royalties to the holding company, which lowered its taxable income. Q: Could this ruling spark a trade war with America? Vestager denies that the EC is targeting US companies. Businesses in Europe need to know they are on a level playing field, she replies. There is no bias in our rulings. They are about ensuring there is competition in Europe, whatever your flag and your ownership. Onto questions. Q: Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour occurred when [Commissioner president] Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg. So was he guilty, or negligent? Commissioner Vestager says the EC investigates behaviour by a member state, rather than conducting a criminal investigation trying to incriminate anyone. Commissioner Vestager then turns to Apple. She explains that the EC is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice, because it has failed to collect a year-old tax bill worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn from tech giant Apple. Vestager suggests Dublin is dragging its feet on this issue... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand that recovery in certain cases maybe more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But member states need to make sufficient progress to restore competition. Background: Last August, the EC penalised Apple for having received unfair deals from Ireland that cut its effective corporate tax rate. That ruling was disputed by the tech company, and the government of Ireland. Vestager insists that the EU isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fining Amazon. We are removing an illegal advantage that it should never have received in the first place, she says. The message is that all companies need to pay their taxes, as the huge majority of companies do, she adds firmly. Margrethe Vestager says Amazon used an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153empty shell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a holding company in Luxembourg to shift profits out of Europe. This holding company had no employees and no offices, she says, and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in developing intellectual property. Instead, it was simply there to cut Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax bill, and ensure that three-quarters of sales in Europe were untaxed. This chart from the EU shows how it was done: Vestager says that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax deal with Luxembourg was unfair, because a local company would have paid four times as much tax on the same profits. NEWSFLASH: The EC is demanding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m from Amazon, to cover the unfair tax advantages it received from basing its European operations in Luxembourg. Those tax benefits are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal under EU state aid rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells the press conference in Brussels. She adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were not taxed. Vestager says Amazon must repay the benefits of that deal, plus interest. In another move, the EU is also taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of tax from Apple, following a ruling against the US tech giant in August 2016. Over in Brussels, European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is preparing to give a press conference on state aid. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to announce that the EC is hitting Amazon with a tax bill over its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsweetheart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal with Luxembourg. You can watch it online here. Some background. Amazon Europe is based in Luxembourg and aggregates the billions of pounds of sales the retailer makes from individual countries across the continent, It emerged in August that Amazon paid just \u00c2\u00a315m in tax on European revenues of \u00c2\u00a319.5bn which were reported through Luxembourg in 2016. James Smith of ING is concerned that new business growth cooled last month: At 53.6, the UK services PMI was a little better than hoped. But dig a little deeper and the key takeaway for us was the fact new business growth is at a 13-month low. With the current PMI roughly indicating growth in the 0.3% region, this latter point means that growth over the next couple of quarters could be equally as sluggish. Once again, political uncertainty was a key factor in holding back growth. It is possible that we see some recovery over the next few months; the fact that the UK government is more united behind the idea of a transition period could help unlock some short-term investment. But a lack of full agreement on the terms or length of such an arrangement, or indeed the ultimate Brexit deal, is likely to keep businesses cautious. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says the drop in new business will knock growth: Chris Sood-Nicholls of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking is encouraged that the headline Services PMI rose last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This slight increase in the index is encouraging, particularly given a backdrop of mixed economic signals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sector still faces a period of uncertainty surrounding Brexit, a sentiment echoed in Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent decision to downgrade the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to Aa2 from Aa1. Those consumer facing parts of the sector will also be mindful of the potential for an interest rate rise in the coming months, particularly as we head into one of the busiest trading periods of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted a nice graph showing all the PMI data this week: The drop in new orders across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector last month is a serious concern, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a stagnation trend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is developing in the sector, with firms unwilling to take risks until they know how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is playing out. Brock explains; Where consumers recovered a little from their spending hesitation last month, it was the turn of businesses to be spooked into inactivity, exerting greater scrutiny over new projects and long-term spending plans. The pressure of Brexit and resulting uncertainty were at the heart of this indecision. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all Sector PMI, which measures growth across the UK economy, has hit its lowest level since the EU referendum, and the second worst in over four years. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector strengthened last month. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI, which tracks activity at thousands of UK firms, has risen to 53.6 for September, up from 53.2 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates a small acceleration. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome news, following data earlier this week showing that factory growth slowed while construction actually shrank in September. But.... service sector bosses also warned that new orders rose at the slowest rate in 13 months. Many told Markit that customers were delaying signing off on large projects due to Brexit related uncertainty [something the Lord Mayor of London will understand.....]. Firms were also hit by rising prices, with input cost inflation hitting a seven month high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to rising food, energy and fuel bills, alongside increased prices for imported items and greater staff salaries, Markit says. Chris Williamson of Markit estimates that the UK economy probably only grew by 0.3% in the last quarter -- matching its growth earlier this year. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The services sector saw another month of modest growth, running in the middle ground between the robust expansion seen in manufacturing and the contraction recorded in construction. The three PMI surveys put the economy on course for another subdued 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter could see even slower growth..... The surveys therefore portray an economy struggling with the unwelcome combination of sluggish growth and rising prices, presenting a dilemma for policymakers. More to follow.... Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery strengthened further last month, indicating that it continues to grow faster than the UK. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit. Its monthly PMI survey of companies across the region has jumped to 56.7 in September, up from 55.7 in August, which shows the fastest growth in four months. Germany, Ireland and France led the way, with firms reporting that output expanded and new orders surged. Job creation was also strong, rising at almost the fastest rate in a decade. No wonder some in the City keep talking about a euroboom.... Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Market says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to have grown by around 0.7% in the third quarter of 2017. The jump in new orders suggests growth will remain strong this autumn. Williamson adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth is also becoming increasingly broadbased, which should help make the upturn more sustainable as corporate profits, labour markets and demand improve across the region. The eurozone therefore looks increasingly able to withstand any political shocks and set for a strong end to the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While the City of London worries about Brexit, the German stock market has just hit a new all-time high. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, though, is flat this morning, having hit a seven-week high yesterday. The Lord Mayor is absolutely right when he says that banks urgently need clarity over Brexit. Several of the biggest firms in the City have already begun shifting jobs overseas; JP Morgan is buying a new office block in Dublin, for example, and Standard Chartered is opening a subsidiary in Frankfurt. But as this graph from Bloomberg shows, thousands more jobs could yet move, depending how negotiations play out. The Lord Mayor of London is urging the UK government to finalise a legally binding Brexit transition period by the end of the year, or risk serious damage to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. Andrew Parmley will warn that banks need to plan ahead, and cannot risk a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that would badly hurt the UK economy. Lord Mayor Parmley will issue the warning at the annual City Banquet - a swanky event at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House tonight. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to welcome Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal of a two-year transition deal after March 2019 - calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. But he insists that this is nailed down within three months, so that financial companies have some clarity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We owe it to the sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to the global financial system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to do all we can not only to maintain our collaborative approach, but to enhance it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is why we cannot have a cliff-edge at the moment of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c businesses must have the certainty of how they will be regulated, and that requires a transition period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal on transition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this will be our bridge to the future. But the idea must become reality, translated into a legal agreement before the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer this is left, the more it damages all our futures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only in the UK, but the economy right across the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also need to know more about the final state, after transition. How can the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most profitable industry be expected to programme its satnav without knowing the destination?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parmley also blasted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economically illiterate calls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to impose new cross-border financial barriers between London and the rest of the world. Parmley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post is mainly ceremonial*. But he does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspeak for the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and this speech is a reminder that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial district isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as upbeat about Brexit as certain government MPs, who seem to think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re re-enacting Agincourt.... Andrew Bailey, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority and Sam Woods, head of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority, are also speaking at tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. Surely they will touch on Brexit too? * - correction, the Lord Mayor isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unelected, as I wrote earlier. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected by residents and businesses in the Square Mile. Apologies for the error. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today is services PMI day, when we learn how service sector companies around the globe fared last month. So, after some underwhelming UK construction and factory data yesterday, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to learn how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant services sector coped in the face of rising inflation and political uncertainty in September City economists expect little improvement on August, so the PMI could be unchanged at 53.2 - a level that shows steady growth. Anything below that will heighten concerns that growth is weakening. Royal Bank of Canada say: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI services report follows weak numbers in both manufacturing (Monday) and construction (yesterday). It is one of the final clues for the initial estimate of Q3 GDP on 25 October (RBC: 0.2%q/q). We see downside risk to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number as well on the back of relatively weak business expectations in recent months Also coming up today.... European traders will be watching events in Spain again, after Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president claimed the region would declare independence \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the end of this week or the beginning of next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last night, the King of Spain weighed in, criticising the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunacceptable disloyalty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders. Could direct rule from Madrid be next? CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson says: Having miscalculated so badly with their reaction at the weekend it would appear that Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is in no mood to compromise and looking to double down. While he is well within his rights under the terms of the law of the constitution it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see how this can end in any other way than badly, and for that history may well judge him harshly. Any further misjudgements by the Spanish government could well also increase the pressure on the EU to come off the fence that it has been so busy trying to stay on, with respect to last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. It could be an expensive morning for Amazon. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (EU) competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is hit the e-commerce giant with a massive bill for back taxes related to its tax arrangement with Luxembourg. Vestager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement could come at 11am UK time. In the City, supermarket chain Tesco has reinstated its dividend and reported a 2.2% rise in like-for-like UK sales in the last quarter. Shareholders will get one shiny penny for each share they own - a small benefit, but as they say, every little helps (sorry). Flooring firm Topps Tiles is also reporting results, and has warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am: Eurozone services PMI for September. Likely to show another month of solid growth, with economists predicting the PMI will be unchanged at 55.6. 9.30am: UK services PMI for September. The City will be hoping that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major economic sector shrugged off Brexit worries last month. 10am: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Reserve Bank of India is likely to leave borrowing cost unchanged. 10am: Eurozone retail sales. Economists predict a 0.3% rise in September. 3pm: US services PMI. After strong factory data on Monday, will America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector also sparkle? Probably.... Tonight: City Banquet at Mansion House",

Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus.</p> <p>The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen...</p> <p>And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent.

Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable...</p> <p>Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since November 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures.</p> <p>Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports.</p> <p>This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and inflation is heading back towards target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. </p> <p>The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently easy monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse implications for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018.</p> </blockquote> <p>Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike.</p> <p>There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prodigal son\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: wage growth.

                "bodyText":"A stronger euro left European markets flagging, not helped by the continuing concerns about the stand-off between the Spanish government and Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence promoters. But with the pound suffering amid the latest political uncertainties in the wake of the Tory party conference, the FTSE 100 managed to edge higher by the end of trading, with its overseas earners benefitting from the prospect of a weaker sterling. A mixed bag for the US, with an unexpected fall in jobs balanced by a rise in wage growth, left Wall Street slipping back from record highs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.88 points or 0.2% at 7522.87 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.09% to 12,955.94 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.36% lower at 5359.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 22,392.31 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.29% lower at 10,185.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.10% to 745.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. A mixture of profit taking and concerns about oversupply have brought a rally in the oil price to an abrupt end. Hopes that producers would extend their agreement to cap output and reduce a supply glut have supported crude prices recently. But they have slipped back after Russia clarified that President Putin had not, as suggested, proposed extending the production cut agreement although he thought it was a possibility. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister also sounded lukewarm about an extension until the end of 2018, saying he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about it. Rising US crude exports have also been taken as a negative factor, along with the re-opening of Libya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil field. The approach of tropical storm Nate to the US Gulf coast is not helping matters either. So Brent crude is currently down 2.7% at $55.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 3.25% to $49.14. The pound continues to flounder against the dollar, both on worries about the political situation in the UK and of course, the strength of the US currency as the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December increases. At the moment the pound is down 0.53% at $1.3047, albeit off its worst levels. Connor Campbell. financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm jobs report only made the week worse for cable, despite a rather unpleasant headline figure. The non-farm number itself was as ugly as they come. For the first time in 7 years the reading came in negative, at -33k against the 82k forecast and the (upwards revised) 169k seen in August. Yet while the figure was far worse than expected, it actually wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that surprising given it covered a period impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Instead of lingering on the shrinking non-farm payrolls, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention turned to rest of the jobs report. Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus. The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen... And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent. And the thing is, there is no guarantee that next week will be any better, especially if the weekend papers are as filled with Tory infighting as one would expect. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the US jobs data. Dominic Rushe writes: The US jobs market stalled in September, losing 33,000 jobs, as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll. It was the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. The US economy had added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year but as the labor department had predicted the storms, which caused fatal and catastrophic damage across Texas and Florida, slowed hiring. But a loss in jobs was far worse than the 80,000 new jobs most US economists had expected would be created. It ends the longest stretch of uninterrupted jobs growth in US history. This was the first loss in jobs since September 2010. Ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report the Bureau of Labor Statistics said some 11.2 million workers lived in the affected areas, about 7.7% of the US workforce. Employment in food services and drinking places declined by 105,000 in September. That sector has added an average of 24,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. The unemployment rate, which was 4.4% in August, fell to 4.2%, a 16-year low. This is the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. In August the economy added 156,000 new jobs, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. The full story is here: After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have paused for breath. Despite the weaker headline jobs figure, the dollar has strengthened on the basis that higher than expected wages growth means the Federal Reserve may well raise interest rates before the end of the year. In turn, that has put a small dampener on equities. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 21 points or 0.09% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.25%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the jobs report data: The dollar has moved higher following the US jobs data, despite a fall in the headline figure. Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December. So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable... Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since November 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures. Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports. This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and inflation is heading back towards target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently easy monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse implications for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said: Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows. Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike. There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prodigal son\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: wage growth. This suggests the economy will grow at a strong pace in the last quarter of the year. Here is a chart showing clearly the impact on leisure and hospitality jobs: And here is the unemployment data and monthly changes: Other key figures from the non-farms report show the overall jobless rate fell unexpectedly to 4.2% from 4.4%. Pay growth was also better-than-expected, picking up to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August. Economists were predicting a smaller rise to 0.3%. The impact on jobs of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma was far greater than economists had predicted in September. The 33,000 fall in non-farm payrolls was the first drop in seven years after workers were displaced and firms delayed hiring. There was a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sectors. Employment in food services and drinking places fell by 105,000 in September, in an industry where most workers are not paid when absent from work. William Wiatrowski, acting commissioner at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, provided some context to the figures: In September, a sharp employment decline in food services and drinking places and below-trend growth in some other industries likely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The storms caused large-scale evacuations and severe damage to many homes and businesses. In the establishment survey, employees who are not paid for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month are not counted as employed. Many employees in areas affected by the hurricanes were likely off payrolls during the reference pay period for September. In September, 1.5 million workers had a job but were not at work for the entire reference week due to bad weather, the highest level for this series over the past 20 years. This series is highly sensitive to the timing of weather events and thus does not capture the immediate effect of all such events on the job market. Payrolls actually fell by 33,000 last month in figures just out, far worse than expected. Economists had predicted 90,000 jobs would be added. Figures for August were revised up to show 169,000 jobs were added (up from a previous estimate of 156,000). More soon... Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, is speaking about trust at the Royal Society of Arts in London. He says that in some ways, loss of trust in institutions is the very definition of a financial crisis, including the most recent one which has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely trust-busting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even as the scars of this crisis heal, this trust deficit might not repair itself naturally. The trust deficit that those in money and finance face may be not cyclical, not temporary, but structural and permanent. And if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, then those of us within financial services, including central banks, will really have to go some to repair that deficit. US non-farm payrolls for September are coming up at 1.30pm. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting the number of jobs added last month fell sharply to 90,000, from 156,000 in August, largely as a result of hurricane disruption. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has announced it is extending its investigations to other 2 Sisters poultry plants in England and Wales, as well as its scandal-hit West Bromwich chicken processing plant. It follows a Guardian and ITV News investigation that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. The FSA said that while it had not identified food safety issues at West Bromwich, the inspection \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highlighted issues requiring management attention, for example in relation to some aspects of staff training and stock control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Heather Hancock, chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said it was extending its investigation until it is satisfied that there is no risk to public health. Over in Greece pensioners have been protesting outside the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest administrative court against further cuts demanded by international creditors. It is the second such demonstration this week as anger mounts over the spectre of yet more cutbacks next year. Helena Smith reports. Gathering outside the Council of State, pensioners shouted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shame on you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as judges met to consider the legality of pensions being further trimmed back. Since the onset of the crisis in late 2009, pensions have been cut 12 times with unionists claiming some 1.5 million retirees are now living on less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 a month. The latest reforms would mean yet more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic reductions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier this week pensioners took to the streets in another show of anger, holding large banners deploring the cuts. With unemployment still hovering around 22%, families are often forced to survive on the pensions of elderly members. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis has hit retirees harder than perhaps any other age group. An estimated 22.2% of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely materially deprived\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unable to fend for themselves, or pay basic bills, according to the EU statistics agency, Eurostat. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item forecasting group, has analysed the UK productivity figures and says Brexit negotiations could further hold back progress: There is a risk that prolonged uncertainty may end up weighing down markedly on business investment and damage productivity. Prolonged difficult Brexit negotiations could increase this risk. This could also be compounded if foreign companies markedly reduce their investment in the UK, diluting any beneficial spill-over of skills and knowledge. Read our full story on the figures here: Easyjet is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 with shares down 2.7% this morning. The low cost carrier is down despite flying a record 24.1m passengers in the three months to September. The airline also said in a trading update that it was on track to make annual profits of \u00c2\u00a3405-\u00c2\u00a3410m, at the higher end of its guidance but below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3495m. Investors are also nervous about what the future holds, after chief executive Carolyn McCall said industry conditions remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this morning: A separate report from the ONS shows that the UK was less productive than the average among the G7 advanced economies in 2016. Output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average in 2016, compared with 15.5% below in 2015. The UK was however more productive than Canada and Japan: Britain was less productive between April and June compared with the previous quarter, with output per hour worked down 0.1%. It was dragged down by the manufacturing sector, where productivity fell in the second quarter by 1.3% according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile services sector productivity was up 0.2% over the period. Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, said the weak figures do not bode well for UK wages, which are already rising at a slower rate than prices: Poor productivity performance underpins the stagnation of real wages, and presents the government with a particular challenge since it appears likely that previous forecasts of earnings, and hence also of tax revenues, have been overoptimistic. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, has this take on developments in Spain and the implications for markets: The IBEX has been hit by profit taking as yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive bounce back was short lived. The decision by Madrid to suspend the Catalan parliament is a short-term solution to the problem, as the two sides are still locked in a stalemate. The Spanish government is in the process of making it easier for companies headquartered in Catalonia to switch their head office to another part of Spain. While Madrid is keeping the pressure on Catalonia, it is likely that dealers will steer clear of the Spanish stock market. Spanish equities and government bonds are underperforming other European markets after Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of foreign affairs said the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament would meet on Monday. It is in defiance of Madrid, after the the Spanish constitutional court suspended the Catalan parliament, threatening more tensions and instability. The Spanish IBEX is down 0.8% at 10,138, while yields on benchmark 10-year bonds were up seven basis points at 1.76%. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: Once again, the market has proved its resilience and confounded the doom mongers. Not that there is too much to get excited about with these figures which confirm what we have seen at the coalface recently - that prices are holding up reasonably well where vendors are realistic, partly in response to a continuing shortage of stock. Sadly, we are not seeing the hoped-for autumn bounce but a steady market is more than welcome with so much uncertain economic news. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is not convinced by the Halifax report: The sudden surge in Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of house prices\u00e2\u20ac\u201dup 3% over the last three months alone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis impossible to reconcile with all the other housing market evidence. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure is the most volatile of all the indices we track. Other surveys show that the pipeline of demand is soft; RICS has reported that new buyer enquiries have fallen in six of the last seven months. Real wages still have further to fall over the next six months and mortgage rates will rise soon in response to the increase in banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 funding costs. As such, we expect most of the pickup in Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index to unwind over the coming months. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says that a flight of equity from London is fuelling activity in the regions: In the current cautious market, prices treading water is good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stability plus gentle growth is very good. But momentum remains patchy and what growth there is is wavering rather than sustained, and prices remain under intense pressure in several key regions. In London, prices have been sliding in many of the areas that saw the frothiest rates of growth during the boom. On the flipside, the flight of equity from the capital is fuelling activity in several regional markets where affordability and perceived value for money is now enticing higher volumes of buyers. Halifax said UK house prices are partly being propped up by a shortage of homes on the market: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Annual house prices rose by 4% in September according to the Halifax price index. It was the strongest rate of growth since February, bucking the trend of other recent reports which have indicated a weakening market. Over the month, prices were up 0.8% reaching a record high of \u00c2\u00a3255,109, and smashing economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a 0.1% increase. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was also revised up to show 1.5% growth over the month, up from a previous estimate of 1.1%. House prices in the three months to September were 1.4% higher than in the previous quarter, the fastest quarterly increase since February. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax Community Bank: The annual rate of growth has picked up for the second consecutive month, rising from 2.6% in August to 4% in September. The average house price is now \u00c2\u00a3225,109 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest on record. UK house prices continue to be supported by an ongoing shortage of properties for sale and solid growth in full-time employment. However, increasing pressure on spending power and continuing affordability concerns may well dampen buyer demand. Investors and economists are increasingly betting that Bank of England policymakers will raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November. Galley says this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weigh on the housing market: There has been recent speculation on the possibility of a rise in the Bank of England base rate. We do not anticipate this will have a significant effect on transaction volumes. Wall Street hit fresh record highs on Thursday, with risk appetite among investors boosted by signs of a robust US economy. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.6% at 2,552.07. It was the sixth consecutive closing high for the first time in more than 20 years. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: A backdrop of strong economic data, optimism for corporate earnings in the third quarter and the recently released plan for tax cuts are fuelling the latest surge. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to revamp the US economy can live up to the hyped-up expectations but repeatedly fresh record highs indicate confidence not caution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty quiet in markets across Europe this morning, as markets await the main event at 1.30pm with the publication of the US non-farm payrolls report in September. Markets are feeling a little more relaxed about developments in Spain, where politicians in Catalonia do no seem able to agree on the best way forward. For now at least, that is helping to ease investor fears. In the UK the FTSE 100 is up just 9 points but is comfortably above the 7,500 mark, having gained 300 points in three weeks. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,517 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.02% at 12,971 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,371 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 22,476 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.4% at 10,177 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 390 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. The pound is under renewed pressure this morning as uncertainty builds over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future as Prime Minister. Grant Shapps, a Tory MP and a former party chairman, has admitted his role in a plan to put pressure on May to call a leadership election. He said MPs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfectly within their rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to call for a contest after May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gamble to win a bigger majority at the general election did not pay off. He told BBC radio 5 live: We did have a result that was not at all what anyone wanted, least of all what she wanted or anticipated, and... sometimes when things happen you have to take responsibility for them. This is a view I have held for quite some time and quite a lot of colleagues feel the same way, including five former cabinet ministers. The pound is down 0.4% at $1.3065. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest against the dollar since 7 September. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of dollar strength as traders bet on a December US interest rate rise. But the pound is also at a three-week low against the euro, down 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1169. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson gives this take: The pound has had another poor week its third weekly decline in a row, as concerns about political instability as well as disappointing economic data have undermined sentiment. seems likely that this discontent will once again amount to nothing more than hot air in the short term at least. The last thing the currency, the Conservative party and more importantly the country needs right now is the self-indulgence of another leadership battle. Also coming up today... 8.30am BST: September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halifax house prices report will provide the latest snapshot of the UK housing market. 9.30am BST: UK productivity figures for April to June. British productivity has been pretty dismal in recent years and policymakers believe improvement here is the key to unlocking stronger wage growth. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the latest. 1.30pm BST: The closely watched non-farm payrolls for September. Economists are predicting a sharp fall in the number of jobs added, to 90,000 in September, from 156,000 in August, as a result of hurricane disruption. The report will also give the latest insight into the pace of earnings growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy.",

                "body":"<p>Christine Lagarde, boss of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to deliver a hard-hitting speech at the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting this week, urging world leaders to push ahead with reforms to turn the current global economic recovery into something more sustainable.</p> <p>Lagarde, who is now in her second four-year term as managing director of the Washington-based lender of last resort, will talk about a lack of education, training and productivity. She will, no doubt, develop the argument she put forward in London a fortnight ago that regulators need to be wary of lenders outside the mainstream repeating the same errors as the banks a decade ago.</p> <p>The need to tame a rapidly growing shadow banking industry will be set alongside concerns about government finances and how those administrations that are awash with cash, like Germany and South Korea, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can use this moment to invest more in their own economies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to help others with large deficits, as she said last week in <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/10/04/sp100517-a-time-to-repair-the-roof\" title=\"\">a speech at Harvard university</a>.</p> <p>But who cares what Lagarde says about the future direction of the global economy? As far as the autocratic leaders who fill the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assembly hall are concerned, the IMF served its purpose in the wake of the crash. Now its ideas for greater co-operation, investment and equality are surplus to requirements, like a wool coat in August or a Royal Navy landing ship in a cost-cutting defence review.</p> <p>Not only is the IMF seen as a hand-wringing liberal institution making nuanced and technical suggestions in an age of simpler, broad-brush solutions, it is wedded to a past that both left and right on the political spectrum are beginning to accept will never&#xa0;return.</p> <p>The normality of galloping productivity gains that lead to improving wage rates, bountiful tax receipts and declining government debts is still a long way off, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given how much commerce is changing with the growing amount of business conducted over the internet, the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may never return.</p> <p>Not that the IMF is giving up its role as adviser to governments large and small about how they should move forwards. Last week it urged the G20 to focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebalancing and ensuring the sustainability of growth, while fine-tuning the macroeconomic policy mix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Rebalancing refers back to the call for Germany and South Korea to splash some of their spare money on the goods and services of their neighbours. In this way, the balance between debtor and surplus countries would narrow to reduce the risk of another financial crash.</p> <p>Except that no one is listening to the G20 either. Least of all the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own members, despite their enthusiasm for a group created to rebuild the global economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crash.</p> <p>Mexico, Australia, Canada and Indonesia are keen to keep the global trading routes open with as few barriers as possible. But the majority of G20 of members are, in different ways, turning in on themselves and of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations, the most they can probably manage is the fine-tuning.</p> <p>China is about to embark of a phase of introspection as the Communist party wrestles with keeping control amid slowing growth.

                "bodyText":"Christine Lagarde, boss of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to deliver a hard-hitting speech at the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting this week, urging world leaders to push ahead with reforms to turn the current global economic recovery into something more sustainable. Lagarde, who is now in her second four-year term as managing director of the Washington-based lender of last resort, will talk about a lack of education, training and productivity. She will, no doubt, develop the argument she put forward in London a fortnight ago that regulators need to be wary of lenders outside the mainstream repeating the same errors as the banks a decade ago. The need to tame a rapidly growing shadow banking industry will be set alongside concerns about government finances and how those administrations that are awash with cash, like Germany and South Korea, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can use this moment to invest more in their own economies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to help others with large deficits, as she said last week in a speech at Harvard university. But who cares what Lagarde says about the future direction of the global economy? As far as the autocratic leaders who fill the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assembly hall are concerned, the IMF served its purpose in the wake of the crash. Now its ideas for greater co-operation, investment and equality are surplus to requirements, like a wool coat in August or a Royal Navy landing ship in a cost-cutting defence review. Not only is the IMF seen as a hand-wringing liberal institution making nuanced and technical suggestions in an age of simpler, broad-brush solutions, it is wedded to a past that both left and right on the political spectrum are beginning to accept will never return. The normality of galloping productivity gains that lead to improving wage rates, bountiful tax receipts and declining government debts is still a long way off, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given how much commerce is changing with the growing amount of business conducted over the internet, the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may never return. Not that the IMF is giving up its role as adviser to governments large and small about how they should move forwards. Last week it urged the G20 to focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebalancing and ensuring the sustainability of growth, while fine-tuning the macroeconomic policy mix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rebalancing refers back to the call for Germany and South Korea to splash some of their spare money on the goods and services of their neighbours. In this way, the balance between debtor and surplus countries would narrow to reduce the risk of another financial crash. Except that no one is listening to the G20 either. Least of all the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own members, despite their enthusiasm for a group created to rebuild the global economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Mexico, Australia, Canada and Indonesia are keen to keep the global trading routes open with as few barriers as possible. But the majority of G20 of members are, in different ways, turning in on themselves and of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations, the most they can probably manage is the fine-tuning. China is about to embark of a phase of introspection as the Communist party wrestles with keeping control amid slowing growth. Germany is busy saving for its ageing baby boomers, while the Trump administration is busy putting America first, which initially means unwinding its trade agreements. The fact that the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global concerns are lost on its most powerful members means that all eyes in Washington next week will be on the real movers and shakers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the central bank governors, who turn up en masse for the IMF bash. Yet they have, almost in unison, expressed the limitations of their powers in recent weeks, not least the Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He will be in Washington with Lagarde and may hint again about an interest rate rise in November. Yet he is the first to say that a sustainable future is one only politicians can forge. More turbulence at Ryanair In a sector long beset by turbulence, the eventual crash of Monarch Airlines was predictable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if still a mighty shock to many staff, and hundreds of thousands of passengers who booked flights without protection. While other airlines, such as Air Berlin and Alitalia, have been kept on life support by their governments, Monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise was sudden.

                "bodyText":"Foreign firms have put the brakes on buying British rivals this year in response to Brexit uncertainty, despite the lure of snapping up businesses that have tumbled in value after a slump in the pound. A study of UK buyouts and merger deals involving foreign firms showed that the value of purchases of British-owned businesses fell in the first nine months of the year to its lowest level since 2010. The internal study by the consultancy EY, seen by the Guardian, found that the value of deals so far this year was roughly two-thirds of the average reported over the last seven years. British firms are awash with cash after three years of bumper profits. The combination of strong balance sheets and the low pound was expected to make them the target of foreigns takeovers or mergers that involve selling a large portion of their business to foreign buyers. But EY said the lack of interest in buying UK firms \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suggests a possible fall in confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects have become clouded in uncertainty. Mark Gregory, EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief UK economist, said the UK was missing out on a global trend for an increasing number of mergers and buyouts, with firms in the eurozone experiencing a surge of cross-border activity in the last year. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fall in the value of foreign mergers and acquisitions of UK companies suggests a possible fall in confidence about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a surge in foreign activity to $100bn in the two quarters after the referendum on EU membership, probably driven by the change in value of sterling, but this fell dramatically in the first quarter of 2017 to $6bn and total activity in 2017 to date is only just over $50bn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Each year, hundreds of foreign firms buy stakes in UK businesses or purchase a company outright to boost their presence in Britain or benefit from specialist technology and expertise. The mobile phone chipmaker Arm Holdings was bought last year by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SoftBank for \u00c2\u00a324.3bn in a move that was seen by government ministers as a vote of confidence in the UK economy after the referendum. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, welcomed figures in the summer that showed the UK attracted more than 2,200 new inward investment projects in 2016-17, a record number. But the statistics published by the Department for International Trade (DIT) revealed new jobs created by foreign investment fell by 9% last year and the number of foreign-controlled companies reporting that they expanded revenues also fell. The department said 75,226 jobs were created in 2016/17, down from 82,650 in 2015/16. The number of firms that reported growing fell from 821 to 782. EY said large deals such as the Arm Holdings buyout made the figures volatile, but a slump in activity was visible this year. Gregory said British businesses had responded to the uncertainty created by the Brexit talks by buying foreign companies, though this had tailed off in recent months. He said the aim was to make themselves less reliant on the UK should it begin to suffer a slowdown when talks between London and Brussels conclude in 2019. UK businesses were also buying domestic rivals, pushing figures for domestic takeovers to $59bn, the highest value since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increased value of domestic activity appears to paint a different picture to the slowing international activity, but it is actually consistent with the implied fall in confidence suggested by the international activity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gregory said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we are observing is increased defensive activity in the domestic market with businesses using M&amp;A to generate revenue or operating synergies through buying scale and reducing competition.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said many of the deals were large companies hoovering up smaller rivals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new skills and technology as an alternative to R&amp;D. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth slowed this year to rank as the lowest in the G7.

Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. </p> \n   <p>Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. </p> \n   <p>However, as Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discount more rapidly early on. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db51c5e4b00593b4d681c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:39:33.231Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>(It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5188e4b00593b4d681c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:38:42.750Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e150180-3d83-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a\">an interview </a>with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) from last year.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5059e4b00593b4d681c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:37:22.172Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives\">From Obama to Cameron, why do so many politicians want a piece of Richard Thaler?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4f2ce4b076f91939cd10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:30:37.737Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account.

Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. </p> \n   <p>One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4ec7e4b076f91939cd0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:26:34.349Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaciorekMagda/status/917332227087831040\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\">Noblista Richard Thaler wyst\u00c4\u2026pi\u00c5\u201a w jednej ze scen filmu The Big Short.

He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><strong>Limited rationality:</strong> Thaler developed the theory of <em>mental accounting,</em> explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of <em>behavioural finance,</em> which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets.</p> \n   <p><strong>Social preferences:</strong> Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretical and experimental research on <em>fairness</em> has been influential. He showed how consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the <em>dictator game,</em> an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world.</p> \n   <p><strong>Lack of self-control:</strong> Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a <em>planner-doer model, </em>which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how <em>nudging</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term he coined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:55:03.398Z\">at 11.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4683e4b00593b4d68193\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:51:51.144Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thaler is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler\">professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago</a>.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db45c5e4b076f91939ccdf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:49:06.887Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:51:29.932Z\">at 10.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4595e4b00593b4d6818a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:47:45.560Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db1f31e4b00593b4d680ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:35:07.827Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-f_6zhUOPQ\"> \n   <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-f_6zhUOPQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:41:05.737Z\">at 10.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db3fa1e4b076f91939ccb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:21:40.819Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/917316544971067392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Turkey?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Turkey</a>'s lira is now the second-worst emerging currency this year. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRY&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$TRY</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7rJip0LSSp\">pic.twitter.com/7rJip0LSSp</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/917316544971067392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db38ece4b00593b4d6814d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:03:12.029Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish lira under pressure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground.</p> \n  <p>The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/us-suspends-handling-of-visas-in-turkey-after-arrest-of-consulate-staffer\">has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey</a> after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency.</p> \n  <p>The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country.

Predictably the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond.</p> \n   <p>However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has eased some of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears.</p> \n   <p>Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery.</p> \n   <p>Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too enthused about the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Just over a year ago Thaler and fellow Nobel prize winning economist Eugene Fama took part in an interesting debate about whether markets were efficient or irrational. He also commented on Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech - not the parts that received the most commentary - but on her organ donor plans, in response to another tweet: Thaler has criticised the Brexit vote as a prime example of irrational behaviour. He told Business Insider just ahead of the UK referendum vote: Most voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really thinking about it in a very analytical way\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The people behind the leave campaign are voting with their guts.

Thaler was apparently slow to wake up when the committee called him with the news of his award, but was unsurprisingly pleased with the news. His biography on the University of Chicago website lists one of his interests as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine wine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which will no doubt be part of a celebration later. His personal website is here but so far, no mention of the Nobel prize. Here is one of the committee members talking about Thaler, and explaining what behavioural economics is: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award: The 2017 Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to the US academic Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his contribution to behavioural economics. The prize, worth 9m Swedish kroner (\u00c2\u00a3845,000), is not among the Nobel Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official awards for literature, peace, medicine, physics and chemistry, but was established separately by Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in memory of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described Thaler as a pioneer of behavioural economics, which had progressed in recent years from a fringe and somewhat controversial field of research into a mainstream component of the economics profession. His research was praised for incorporating psychological assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. The prize-givers said his work had shown how the limitations of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge in the decision-making process, as well as the consequences of social preferences and a lack of self control, can affect people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions as well as market outcomes. Thaler, born in New Jersey in 1945, is a career academic and a Charles R Walgreen distinguished service professor of behavioural science and economics, and the director of the Center for Decision Research at the University of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Booth School of Business. He made a cameo appearance in the 2015 film The Big Short, sitting beside Selina Gomez at a blackjack table. He is a leading proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nudge theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a concept of behavioural science that suggests small interventions in the environment, or incentives, can encourage people to make different decisions. The full report is here: Here is the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on self-control: In the twelfth song of the Odyssey, Circe warns Odysseus about the Sirens, who lure sailors with their enchanting singing. Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. However, as Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discount more rapidly early on. (It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize). And here is an interview with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) from last year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote: When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account. They also have ideas about what is fair, and they can consider other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare in both a positive way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through cooperation or solidarity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a negative way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as through jealousy or malice. Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez: One of Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theories is about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mental accounting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The citation describes this as using different reference points to help make decisions, which vary from situation to situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One reference point could be the price for which we bought an item, or the lowest price we find when searching on the internet, and we use this reference point to assess whether we have made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In his research, Thaler has provided numerous examples of how mental accounting using differing reference points may lead to decisions that appear strange when evaluated from a traditional economic perspective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An example: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A consumer who finds out that the watch she is about to buy is 100 Swedish krona cheaper in another shop. She chooses to go to the other shop if the watch costs 1,000 krona but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do so if it costs 10,000 krona even though the saving in krona is the same. The explanation is that she focuses on the percentage, rather than on the actual saving relative to the reference point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research is here. The citation defines behavioural economics as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a research field in which insights from psychological research are applied to economic decision-making. A behavioural perspective incorporates more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions, providing new opportunities for designing measures and institutions that increase societal benefit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The committee is asked about the lack of women winners of the Nobel prizes, and the panel says they are concerned and they are taking measures to improve the situation. They think things will improve and hope it will be different in five to ten years time. Thaler is asked about the Chinese economy, but says he is not really an expert on that. And he is now gone. He is asked about his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short Hollywood career\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - he was in The Big Short - saying someone successful in something is assumed to be successful going forward, and how that could apply to Donald Trump. Thaler says he is disappointed his Hollywood career was not part of the official speech giving him the award. As for Trump, he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he would do well to watch that movie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked how he will spend the prize money, Thaler says he will try to spend it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as irrationally as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thaler is on the phone to the press conference now. He is asked what the most important aspect of his research is. He says it is the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that. The citation says Thaler has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes: Limited rationality: Thaler developed the theory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of behavioural finance, which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets. Social preferences: Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretical and experimental research on fairness has been influential. He showed how consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the dictator game, an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world. Lack of self-control: Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a planner-doer model, which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how nudging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term he coined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts. The committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thaler is professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog: Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground. The US has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency. The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country. Traders responded aggressively to the news, sending the Lira more than 6% lower against the U.S. currency - its steepest decline since 15 July 2016, when Turkey witnessed the bloodiest coup attempt in its political history. However, the Lira managed to recover more than half of its losses, as investors viewed the recent tensions as controllable. With Turkey increasing political ties with Russia and Iran, and Washington continuing to support Kurdish groups, the political risk premium is likely to keep pressuring the Lira. However, it would require far more escalation to see the currency trading near January lows of 3.94. Meanwhile the main Turkish stock market index, the BIST 100, has fallen 3.5%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something on the only woman to win the Economics prize: Here are some facts and figures about the Nobel Prize in economics: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s striking that only one woman has won the prize since it was first awarded in 1969. And if this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner is indeed one of the favourites, it will remain that way. Back with the pound, and the currency is shrugging off the latest Brexit worries and political problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling is using Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather severe losses. One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond. However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has eased some of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears. Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery. Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too enthused about the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell. The Eurozone indices were far perkier; the DAX hit a new high after climbing 0.3%, and is inches away from crossing 13000, while the CAC surged 0.5% to graze 5375. One notable mover in the markets in hotels group Millennium and Coptthorne. Its shares have soared 23% to 554p on news that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City Developments has offered to buy the shares in the group it does not already own. The move values M&amp;C at around \u00c2\u00a31.8bn. Given City Developments already indirectly owns 65.2%, a bid for the rest should not have come as too much of a surprise to the market, but still, the offer at 552.5p a share looks generous enough. European markets have got off to a mixed start. The FTSE 100 is down 0.06%, not helped by the slight strengthening of the pound which is not helpful to the overseas earners which dominate the index. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.2% and ouched a new all time high while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has edged up 0.1%. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 0.6% despite the continuing concerns about Catalan independence. Earlier German industrial output beat expectations, rising 2.6% in August compared to a 0.1% fall in July and forecasts of a 0.7% increase. But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cynical reminder about predictions about the winners: Indeed last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winners, Oliver Hart of Harvard, and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of MIT, were not top of the lists of likely recipients. My colleague Richard Partington has been looking at the runners and riders, who include the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and a string of US academics. His full report is here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mainly be concentrating on the annual Nobel prize in economics, due to be announced in a few hours in Stockholm. And first things first. It comes up every year, but just to be clear, the economics prize is not one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Nobel prizes like the literature and peace awards handed out last week. Officially it is known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. It was set up by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank) in 1968 and is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the same principles as the Nobel prize. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the biggest prize in economics, worth 9m Swedish kronor (\u00c2\u00a3848,091) and awarded in the past to illustrious names such as John Hicks, Jan Tinbergen, John Nash, and Joseph Stiglitz, 78 in all since it was established. Last year it was won by UK-born Oliver Hart of Harvard University and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their work on contract theory, covering a range of issues from executive pay to public-private partnerships. It comes at a time when economists, and experts in general, have been coming under increasing pressure with the rise in populism and the dismissal by some of their worth (step forward Michael Gove for one). But with the global economy still suffering the effects of the financial crisis and the likes of Wolfgang Schaeuble warning of the prospect of another bubble, there is still a need for expert economic analysis. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon see who is deemed to be top of the field at the moment. The announcement is due around 11.45am in Sweden, or 10.45am in the UK.... Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet start to the week. The pound is edging higher against the dollar after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines, while stock markets are expected to be rather subdued to start with:",

We think that Congress will pass a small fiscal stimulus early next year and that this will help to boost US GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018, a touch higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of 2.3%.</p> <p>[On the UK] the headlines focussed on the 0.3pps downgrade to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 UK growth forecast from its projection in April. But this was partly due to the Fund catching up with weaker-than-expected growth early this year, which we had already incorporated in our forecasts. And although the IMF attributed this slowdown in the UK to the long-term adverse impact of Brexit starting to show, we think it instead reflects the (temporary) impact of the lower pound on consumers. Indeed, our forecast for GDP growth in 2018 of 2.2% is significantly higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of 1.5%...</p> <p>Our forecasts for the major emerging economies differ significantly from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our view is that GDP growth in both China and India will be 6.0% this year, which is slower than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts of 6.8% and downwardly-revised 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, we expect the recoveries in Brazil and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies to be stronger than the IMF expects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59dce010e4b0c8da8831d8b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-10T15:02:20.149Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts suggest the global economy could be getting back to normal after the battering it received during the financial crisis, suggests Aviva Investors. </strong>Senior economist Stewart Robertson said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After five years (2013-2017 inclusive) when the IMF routinely revised its global growth expectations lower, they have for the second time in a row revised it higher for the year ahead. The differences may be quite small, but the fact they are in a positive direction is news in itself. Having got used to regular disappointments, successive growth upgrades are an indication that things are perhaps changing in a good way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the economic expansion has become more entrenched. Solid foundations now provide a sound base for ongoing growth and slow normalisation after ten-years of doubt and setback.</p> <p>At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in Washington the IMF was keen to highlight that growth outcomes in the first half of 2017 were stronger than expected and also that the continuing economic recovery had become more broad-based. This being the IMF, however, it was not all good news. It was noticeable that compared to as recently as July, the UK was the only major developed nation <em>not</em> to receive an upward growth revision. The reasons for this are well-documented, largely the result of weaker consumer spending. Looking further ahead, the IMF referred to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd medium-term outlook, a direct consequence of Brexit. The last time that Britain was such a notable underperformer was in the dark days of the 1970s. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope it is cyclical this time, not structural.</p> <p>The IMF also stressed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the recovery is not complete\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a strange choice of phrase, suggesting that there is a standard template for economic revivals. As any student of economic history will tell you, they are all different. Variations on a theme perhaps, but this one especially is treading a great deal of new ground. The themes that the IMF chooses to draw special attention to in advanced nations are below-target inflation in several countries and weak productivity growth and rising old-age dependency. We believe that global inflation will return gradually as long as growth continues, but recognise that the longer-term supply-side issues will be an enduring challenge for the decades to come.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59dcdeede4b0c8da8831d8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-10T14:57:13.133Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from Ireland:</p> <blockquote> <p>There were two new initiatives in the Irish budget prompted by concerns over public health.</p> <p>First, a Sugar Tax of 30 cents per litre on soft drinks which have between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres in them.</p> <p>The Irish Heart Foundation described the imposition of the tax as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark day in the fight against obesity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Sunbeds and tanning salons have been hit with extra VAT charges rising from 13.5 per cent to 23 per cent.

                "bodyText":"A rise in banking shares helped lift the FTSE 100 to a two month high, with brokers saying they should benefit from a soft Brexit. Better than expected industrial production figures helped outweigh a jump in the UK trade deficit. But European markets edged lower on uncertainty ahead of the Catalan parliament discussing independence. (Our live blog on the meeting is here.) The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 30.38 points or 0.4% at 7538.27 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.21% to 12,949.25 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.04% at 5363.65 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.63% to 22,335.91 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.92% at 10,142.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.65% to 755.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 28 points or 0.13%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The IMF predictions are too pessimistic for the UK and too optimistic for China and India, says Nikita Shah at Capital Economics, who is also more optimistic about a fiscal stimulus in the US next year: The Fund dropped its assumption of a fiscal expansion taking place [in the US], due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant policy uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We think that Congress will pass a small fiscal stimulus early next year and that this will help to boost US GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018, a touch higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of 2.3%. [On the UK] the headlines focussed on the 0.3pps downgrade to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 UK growth forecast from its projection in April. But this was partly due to the Fund catching up with weaker-than-expected growth early this year, which we had already incorporated in our forecasts. And although the IMF attributed this slowdown in the UK to the long-term adverse impact of Brexit starting to show, we think it instead reflects the (temporary) impact of the lower pound on consumers. Indeed, our forecast for GDP growth in 2018 of 2.2% is significantly higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of 1.5%... Our forecasts for the major emerging economies differ significantly from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our view is that GDP growth in both China and India will be 6.0% this year, which is slower than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts of 6.8% and downwardly-revised 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, we expect the recoveries in Brazil and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies to be stronger than the IMF expects. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts suggest the global economy could be getting back to normal after the battering it received during the financial crisis, suggests Aviva Investors. Senior economist Stewart Robertson said: After five years (2013-2017 inclusive) when the IMF routinely revised its global growth expectations lower, they have for the second time in a row revised it higher for the year ahead. The differences may be quite small, but the fact they are in a positive direction is news in itself. Having got used to regular disappointments, successive growth upgrades are an indication that things are perhaps changing in a good way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the economic expansion has become more entrenched. Solid foundations now provide a sound base for ongoing growth and slow normalisation after ten-years of doubt and setback. At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in Washington the IMF was keen to highlight that growth outcomes in the first half of 2017 were stronger than expected and also that the continuing economic recovery had become more broad-based. This being the IMF, however, it was not all good news. It was noticeable that compared to as recently as July, the UK was the only major developed nation not to receive an upward growth revision. The reasons for this are well-documented, largely the result of weaker consumer spending. Looking further ahead, the IMF referred to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd medium-term outlook, a direct consequence of Brexit. The last time that Britain was such a notable underperformer was in the dark days of the 1970s. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope it is cyclical this time, not structural. The IMF also stressed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the recovery is not complete\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a strange choice of phrase, suggesting that there is a standard template for economic revivals. As any student of economic history will tell you, they are all different. Variations on a theme perhaps, but this one especially is treading a great deal of new ground. The themes that the IMF chooses to draw special attention to in advanced nations are below-target inflation in several countries and weak productivity growth and rising old-age dependency. We believe that global inflation will return gradually as long as growth continues, but recognise that the longer-term supply-side issues will be an enduring challenge for the decades to come. More from Ireland: There were two new initiatives in the Irish budget prompted by concerns over public health. First, a Sugar Tax of 30 cents per litre on soft drinks which have between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres in them. The Irish Heart Foundation described the imposition of the tax as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark day in the fight against obesity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunbeds and tanning salons have been hit with extra VAT charges rising from 13.5 per cent to 23 per cent. The Irish government said this was in line with its National Cancer Strategy to reduce cancer particular of the skin. It is the most common form of cancer in Ireland. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts have had little impact on the markets, reckons Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: [The IMF} was relatively upbeat this Tuesday, stating that the world economy should grow by 3.7% in 2017, up from 3.2% in 2016, while maintaining those levels in 2018. However, the IMF wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so positive about the UK, stating it was an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexception\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the overall chirpy outlook due to the uncertainty of Brexit, and the subsequent impact on wages and household spending. Yet...none of this made too much difference to investors. Cable continued to chug along with a 0.3% to 0.4% rise, while sterling dipped 0.1% to 0.2% against the euro. The FTSE rode the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconsistent performance to a 20 point increase, while the DAX and CAC fell 0.4% and 0.2% respectively off the back of the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half a percent jump against the dollar (a move that was already in place before the IMF upgraded the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts). Market-wise the biggest news was probably that the Dow Jones hit a fresh all-time high. But even this was pretty lame, the index briefly spiking to 22850 before settling back below 22800. More on the Irish budget. Henry McDonald writes: Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget for 2018 has included some extra measures to help smaller and medium businesses cope with the impact of Brexit. Paschal Donohoe, Irish Finance Minister, has announced a Brexit Loan Scheme for the small business sector in the Republic. SME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employ 69 per cent of the Irish workforce. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25m is being set aside to help small businesses in the agri-food sector. The body that promotes trade across the Irish Sea has welcomed the loan scheme. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce said the loan scheme would give the SME sector \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the means to adequately prepare for Brexit [and] is vital as part of our national effort to mitigate the negative impacts of Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another major headline figure in the budget has been a promised \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.8bn for housing. There has been massive pressure on the Fine Gael minority government to start building more public housing in response to rising rents, soaring mortgage costs and the fact that there are 3,000 children currently living in emergency accommodation in Dublin. He is asked about his first impressions of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plans, and if he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer that, could he say what would be an appropriate plan? Obstfeld says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we on the second impression at least?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t indeed answer the first part of the question. He says there is a lot yet to be determined in the tax plan, people might think it is just detail but it is quite crucial to how the thing will work and what deficit or surplus in the government budget it will lead to. As a general priniple, he says, simplification is a good thing; if it brings a sharp reduction in exemptions, loopholes, special giveaways allowing a reduction in rates, that is a good thing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are increasingly aware that tax systems have to be cogniscent of how they affect inequality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They need to be attuned to the needs of the middle class and those below the median. What happens with government revenues is important as well, do you invest in infrastructure, people. Where the US is, he adds, we feel that whatever the tax reform plan, it should not increase the deficit, tax reform should be revenue enhancing. The US could usefully use more revenue. And the press conference ends. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Elliott asks about the risks to the outlook that the IMF has identified, and says the financial markets do not seem to be taking these on board. Are the markets being irrationally exhuberant? Obstfeld jokes that it is fitting that Richard Thaler won the economics Nobel prize yesterday ( irrationality being one of his themes) although he adds \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he wan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the irrational exhuberance guy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (that was of course Alan Greenspan.) He adds, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is always difficult to determine what a fair asset price is in a rigorous way [but] when you view a number of indices at historic highs, you have to wonder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To some degree [markets] are supported by low interest rates, and growth expectations which could be disappointed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer term growth rates, especially in advanced economies, could see a slowdown, and if interest rates rise more quickly than expected, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an abrupt repricing [of assets] which could be disruptive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are not ready to make a judgement that assets are overpriced. he adds, but we are ready to say there are risks and there could be a downward adjustment. The IMF is asked about the effects of the recent hurricanes and tropical storms. Obstfeld says they will obviously have a big impact on the regional outlook, less so on the global outlook. He says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We stand ready with our rapid financing facility if that is needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Going forward, if some events become more routine - with theories as to why, some linked to climate change - the international community has to think about what kind of support it can give to communities...the suffering is quite grave. Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 55 points or 0.25%. On the US: The IMF is asked by a Portuguese journalist about the situation in Catalonia. Obstfeld says the situation in Spain is concerning, there is a lot of uncertainty, and we can only hope the parties do not act precipitously [but] negotiate. There are a lot of potential gains on both sides if they do settle. There would probably be spillovers [from the Catalonia situation] to Portugal and other countries in Europe. The IMF are now taking questions on the world economic outlook. The panel is asked about Brexit, and the impact on the UK and European economies if no deal is agreed? Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We very much hope negotiations can be constructive and minimise the costs to both sides.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the clock is short, he added, especially as whatever deal there is has to be approved by the 27 members of the EU. He said Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Florence was very constructive, when she suggested a two year transition period. That could be a good thing, he said, if it allows more time for adjustments, given there is a clear process in getting to the end point. And here is Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of the IMF report: Ahead of its annual meeting in Washington later this week, the International Monetary Fund has issued its latest update on the global economy. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent recovery may not last, despite a pickup in activity in all western countries except the UK. Marking the 10th anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, the IMF said there was a risk that governments could be lulled into a false sense of security by booming markets and policymakers needed to guard against complacency. The Washington-based fund said in its half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) that global output growth would increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% this year and 3.7% in 2018. It upgraded its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for this year and next from the last full WEO in April and the update to its forecasts in July. The full story is here: If NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate is right, the UK economy probably grew slower than the rest of Europe, for the third quarter in a row. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy probably grew by 0.4% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest monthly forecasts from the NIESR thinktank. If NIESR are right, that means the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has picked up a little, from 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017. Any increase in growth is welcome, but this would still be below the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent trend growth. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, explains: Although economic growth is likely to be a touch stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when real GDP growth in other major economies such as the Euro Area and the USA has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. Kara adds that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong chance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that UK interest rates will be increased in November, if next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows that inflation has risen and the labour market is still strong. Over in parliament, business minister Claire Perry has told MPs that the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stands ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help BAE Systems workers. Perry said the government would work to avoid compulsory redundancies at the company (but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving much detail about how, exactly). She is being criticised by opposition MPs for not supporting the company. In response, Perry denied that UK defence spending changes were responsible for the 2,000 job cuts announced today. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no lack of productivity at the OBR, though. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created a handy little video on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems: Over in Ireland, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no bonanza\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no fireworks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Speaking before a pre-budget cabinet meeting this Tuesday morning, Varadkar the latest financial measures would mark another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small sustainable step in the right direction for our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, is expected to announce modest tax cuts for middle income earners in Ireland of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 per year. Donohoe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget has been backed by the Independent Alliance and the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. Fianna Fail operates a similar policy of confidence and supply to the Fine Gael minority government that the Democratic Unionist Party uses to keep Theresa May and the Tories in power. The highlights the budget for 2018 in Ireland are expected to be: A rise in the Irish minimum wage by 30 cents to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.55 per hour. A hike in stamp duty tax on commercial property sales by 5 per cent which could raise up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m for the Irish Exchequer. Tax cuts including the slashing of the Universal Social Charge that was imposed on Ireland by the IMF and ECB when the country was bailed out of national bankruptcy. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 million allocated to the farming sector to help farmers with the fall out from Brexit. A sugar tax will be imposed but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be implemented until April next year. Fifty cents put onto a packet of twenty cigarettes, bringing the price to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11 for the first time. No rises in the price of alcoholic drinks. The solution to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problem must include raising skills levels among the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity headache is a self-inflicted wound. Years of cuts, low public investment, and rising job insecurity have taken a heavy toll. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to return to the drawing board. Our yawning productivity gap is holding our economy back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Brexit fast approaching, we urgently need to create more highly-skilled jobs. And improve workforce training and engagement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Making predictions is very difficult, especially about the future, as the old saying has it. The OBR doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away from this either. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows how it has been too optimistic about UK growth and business investment, and also expected interest rates to be rather higher today. Heads-up: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just posted a new version of the UK trade data chart (in the 9.58am post) showing how imports hit a record high in August. You might need to refresh to see it. The OBR says there are several reasons why UK productivity growth has been so disappointing. 1) Firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spending enough on new equipment and infrastructure. Business investment today is just 5 per cent above its pre-crisis peak almost a decade ago, compared to 63% after the 1980s recession. 2) Zombie firms are clinging onto life. Record low interest rates mean that companies who would normally have gone bust are still operating, but not contributing much. 3) Brexit uncertainty is making bosses cautious. OK, this only explains recent productivity problems, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that companies are choosing to hire workers, who can be laid off easily, rather than investing in new capital. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end result: Lower productivity = lower economic growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility has announced that it expects to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd downgrade its estimates of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential productivity growth. The fiscal watchdog, which is independent of the government, has admitted that it has been too optimistic over productivity for many years. It now plans to make amends at the next budget, in November. This is a serious blow to chancellor Philip Hammond - weak productivity means slower growth, and thus erodes the size of his war chest to help the UK economy. In a new report, the OBR points out that productivity has lagged its forecasts since 2010, while employment and average hours worked have both exceeded forecasts. The OBR says : While we continue to believe that there will be some recovery from the very weak productivity performance of recent years, the continued disappointing outturns, together with the likelihood that heightened uncertainty will continue to weigh on investment, means that we anticipate significantly reducing our assumption for potential productivity growth over the next five years in our forthcoming November 2017 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So why is UK productivity so bad, and what did the OBR get wrong? The watchdog says it had expected productivity rise as firms stopped \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchoarding labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after the financial crisis and invested in new machinery instead. It also hoped that it would pick up once banks were strong enough to lend more to the real economy. But this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened.... In a blow to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing base, arms manufacturer BAE has announced plans to cut almost 2,000 jobs. The axe will fall heavily on BAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories in Lancashire, including its site at Warton on the outskirts of Preston. The company is blaming a decline in orders for its Eurofighter Typhoon. It has also suffered from public sector spending cuts since the financial crisis. Unions are urging the government to help the company by committing to new orders soon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade, industrial production and construction data paint a mixed picture of the UK economy, says Kate Davies of the Office for National Statistics. You can see the UK trade data yourself, here. The Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political editor is also struck by the rise in EU exports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures are no better if you strip out \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 elements, such as trade in gold, precious stones and aircraft, and oil. In better news, UK manufacturing output rose by 0.4% in August, better than expected. That means British factories have enjoyed their best quarter of growth since February. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders also had a better month; construction output rose by 0.65 in August, the first increased since May. This may encourage the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates next month. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial Production rose by 0.9% in the three months to August, with the largest contribution coming from manufacturing. Construction output also picked up slightly in August, boosted by infrastructure and private house building. These figures will feed into the first estimate of Q3 GDP, ahead of the next MPC meeting in November. A majority on the MPC appear committed to a rate hike at that meeting, which is now 80% priced in by the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour MP Stephen Doughty says the widening of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alarming news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and shows the dangers of leaving the EU single market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were repeatedly told that crashing the pound would result in a major boost for British exports. But 15 months on we are still waiting, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world continues to widen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures only serve to underline how reckless it is for the Government to be wrenching the UK out of the Single Market, our largest export market right on our doorstep, in pursuit of fantasy trade deals on the other side of the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is from Andy Bruce of Reuters: Brexit didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the UK expanding its exports to other European countries over the last three months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Britain sold an extra \u00c2\u00a31.7bn of goods to the EU in June-August, but suffered a drop in sales to the rest of the world. The ONS says: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00c2\u00a34.0 billion (8.8%) between the three months to May 2017 and the three months to August 2017. As shown in Figure 2, almost half was due to a decrease in fuel exports (\u00c2\u00a31.9 billion). Exports of goods to the EU increased by \u00c2\u00a31.7 billion (4.1%) between the three months to May 2017 and the three months to August 2017, due to machinery and transport equipment exports increasing by \u00c2\u00a30.8 billion, and smaller increases elsewhere. In total, the UK exported \u00c2\u00a342.7bn of goods to the EU in June, July and August, and imported \u00c2\u00a366.6bn. The widening of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit last month is a disappointment, says Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Thiru writes: Taken together with the recent widening of the current account deficit, the figures paint a rather gloomy picture of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external position. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest trade data is further evidence that the decline in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value over the past year is doing little to boost the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall trade position. Businesses continue to report that the post-EU referendum weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with firms continuing to face higher input costs due to the weakening currency, particularly those locked into global supply chains. For those companies that rely on overseas suppliers for their production equipment, a weak pound also makes investment in growth less viable. As Ben Chu of the Independent points out, the drop in the pound last year hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revitalised Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports of goods from the EU hit a record high last month. The UK imported \u00c2\u00a322bn of physical items from Europe in August, but only exported \u00c2\u00a314bn, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. That highlights the importance of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to the rest of Europe. Brexit supporters will argue that this should help Theresa May cut a good trade deal..... But the UK also imported \u00c2\u00a319bn of goods from outside the EU -- which is also a record high -- while exporting \u00c2\u00a313.8bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall goods deficit hit a record high last month, as this chart shows: Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world has hit a record high. The gap between what the UK bought and sold widened to \u00c2\u00a314.245 in August, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much bigger than expected, and up from \u00c2\u00a312.8bn in July. Imports surged by 4.2% during the month, due to higher imports of chemicals, machinery and textiles. Exports, though, only rose by 0.7% during the month. Despite a surplus in services trade, the overall UK trade deficit has now widened to \u00c2\u00a35.626bn, the biggest reading in 12 months. Over the last three months, the total UK trade deficit in goods and services widened by \u00c2\u00a32.9 billion to \u00c2\u00a310.8 billion. More to follow. The pound is creeping higher in early trading, gaining 0.4 of a cent to almost $1.319. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since last Wednesday, when Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnightmare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party conference speech sparked speculation over her future. Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza shares are having a sizzling morning, jumping almost 11% in early trading and outperforming the rest of the London market. Traders are pleased that it is pressing on with 90 new UK store openings this year, despite warning that British consumers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sales across the fast food group jumped by 20% in the last quarter, with UK online sales also strong. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is fighting off rising competition: Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a cash generative business model and significant potential to add new stores in the UK and overseas. Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are winning market share in the pizza delivery sector, not least due to the strength of their online ordering platform, which saw online sales in the UK rise 17.4%. In Q3, Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turned up the marketing heat, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dine for \u00c2\u00a39.99\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offer and customers responded strongly, despite increasing competition in the online food delivery sector from Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Elsewhere, after a mixed session in Asia, European stock markets are pretty flat. The FTSE 100 has inched up a bit, but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX has lost 0.4% amid Catalonian worries. Economics blogger Jeroen Blokland is impressed by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German trade figures: Just in: French industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, by 0.3% Manufacturing output dropped too, by 0.4%. Economists had expected industrial output to have risen by 0.4%, so this indicates that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may have softened a little last summer. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has widened again, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to enjoy a good year. New figures released this morning show that seasonally adjusted exports rose by 3.1% in August, the biggest rise in a year, while imports only rose by 1.2%. That shows that the stronger euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t preventing German firms from racking up new business. It pushed the German trade surplus up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21.6bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.3bn in July. On an annual basis, exports were 7.2% higher than a year ago: Whil Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK trade is on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind right now, with the Brexit negotiations struggling to make meaningful progress and the risks of no deal rising. So economists will be poring over the latest trade figures, due this morning, to see what shape Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in. The City predicts that Britain ran up a trade deficit of around \u00c2\u00a32.8bn, close to the \u00c2\u00a32.87bn incurred in July. That is due to an estimated trade on goods deficit of around \u00c2\u00a311.2bn, as Britain continued to buy in much more stuff than she produces. But this will probably be partially balanced by the service sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional surplus. The figures will also show how dependent Britain was on imports and exports with the European Union. Recent figures have shown that UK exports to the EU have risen since the referendum, while the deficit with the rest of the world has dropped. That could change, though, if new restrictions are imposed on trade across the Channel from 2019 if a transition deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed (as the government warned yesterday). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tweet from a month ago, showing the situation in July: The ONS will also report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector fared in August. Industrial production is expected to grow by 0.2% during the month, as the weaker pound helped factories to sell their wares (and pushed up the cost of imported raw materials). New industrial production reports from across the eurozone will give an international comparison.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems will also come under the microscope today, when the the Office for Budget Responsibility publishes its annual forecast evaluation report. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog will probably admit that it has overestimated UK productivity growth for several years, which means the economy is in worse shape than we thought. That will be followed by a new estimate of how fast (or slow?) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew in the last three months. The NIESR thinktank is expected to estimate growth of around 0.3% in July-September. Then, the International Monetary Fund issues its own healthcheck on the global economy, the World Economic Outlook, at 2pm BS (9am in Washington). This will show the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest growth forecasts, and also highlight the key risks that could spark a downturn, or even a new financial crisis. Elsewhere, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BAE Systems may announce sweeping job cuts at its aerospace and naval servicing operation today. On the corporate side, Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza has reported another quarter of growth, up 12% in the UK. European stock markets look quiet, with the FTSE 100 expected to drop by just 6 points at the open to 7501. Traders will be watching Spain closely, where the President of Catalonia will address the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament later today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30: Office for National Statistics publishes UK trade, industrial production and construction output data for August 11am: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office For Budget Responsibility releases its latest Forecast evaluation report, showing how its forecasts compared with reality. 1pm: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates UK growth in the last three months. 1pm: Ireland presents its 2018 budget 2pm: International Monetary Fund releases the latest World Economic Outlook",

Speaking in Washington on Thursday to mark the start of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting, Lagarde said negotiators had to put the interests of people before those of business, and that there was a need to end uncertainty. Her words came as there were fresh signs that talks between the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, are deadlocked over the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divorce bill, which is delaying the start of negotiations on a future trade agreement.

Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to call this the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max\">Mad Max problem</a>. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed?</p> <p>For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? </p> <p>The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process...</p> <p>To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a <a href=\"https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\">Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"443e9f14a707164845dc678210a040aecb3ad5bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/443e9f14a707164845dc678210a040aecb3ad5bd/0_135_4072_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Atlases Russian Business Forum, Day 2MOSCOW REGION, RUSSIA - OCTOBER 6, 2017: Bitcoin cryptocurrency souvenir coins at the 2017 Atlases Russian Business Forum at the Crocus City Hall.

Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem.</p> <p>One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited.</p> <p>That sounds like a smart idea. However, it implies that only those wealthy enough to be able to put resources in escrow can join the mining process. This creates a plutocracy, which sits uncomfortably with cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anarchistic and libertarian roots.</p> <p>My conclusion is that finding a sustainable and fair solution to the Mad Max Problem is one of the biggest challenges for the cryptocurrency community today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e0d07601a8e6075b954bee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T14:42:41.063Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US inflation figure was the main focus in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, and it came in below expectations:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dollar didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the hawkish data delivery it wished for this Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, not quite anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving (an admittedly tiny) slither of doubt surrounding the potential December rate hike.</p> <p>The afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad by any means.

Yet those readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter to investors, who instead focused on the fact inflation rose from 0.4% to 0.5%, not the 0.6% forecast.</p> <p>With a the Fed constantly mentioning their concerns about weak US inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and how it imperils the chances of an interest rate rise before the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a miss the dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to indulge. Instead the greenback shed 0.2% against both the pound and the euro, while dropping 0.3% against the yen. This allowed the Dow Jones to continue its seemingly unstoppable march to daily all-time highs, with the index lurking just below 22900 following a 50 point rise.</p> <p>As for sterling, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a pretty inconsistent day.

The inflation situation in the US allowed cable to keep above $1.33; against the euro, however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1265-crossing 9 day highs and sub-$1.12 lows, eventually settling just above that latter level with a 0.1% rise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e0ca6f6cff230798e83671\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T14:20:45.879Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/918841765955821569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow!

But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic.</p> <p>The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations).</p> <p>In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher....</p> <p>September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy.</p> <p>We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption.

                "bodyText":"An uncertain day for markets saw the FTSE 100 end lower after hitting a new closing peak on Thursday. A profit warning from GKN did not help, but the index was supported by a rise in mining shares following a surge in Chinese imports. On the other hand, sterling managed to maintain its positive mood against the dollar - with the US currency weakened by disappointing inflation numbers - which in turn undermined the overseas earners in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index. Conversely the more domestic focused FTSE 250 edged higher to another closing peak. In Europe the picture was mixed, while in the US, Wall Street moved higher despite a little uncertainty over a December interest rate rise following the inflation figures.

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Presented without comment: Back with Bitcoin, and a senior economist reckons the cryptocurrency faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mad Max problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Teunis Brosens, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank says: A core element of cryptocurrency is the lack of a central authority. Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to call this the Mad Max problem. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed? For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process... To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh. ...The cryptocurrency community is aware of the sheer energy consumption issue. Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem. One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited. That sounds like a smart idea. However, it implies that only those wealthy enough to be able to put resources in escrow can join the mining process. This creates a plutocracy, which sits uncomfortably with cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anarchistic and libertarian roots. My conclusion is that finding a sustainable and fair solution to the Mad Max Problem is one of the biggest challenges for the cryptocurrency community today. The US inflation figure was the main focus in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, and it came in below expectations: The dollar didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the hawkish data delivery it wished for this Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, not quite anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving (an admittedly tiny) slither of doubt surrounding the potential December rate hike. The afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad by any means. Retail sales saw a huge bounce from -0.1 to 1.6% month-on-month while consumer confidence hit its highest level since 2004. Yet those readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter to investors, who instead focused on the fact inflation rose from 0.4% to 0.5%, not the 0.6% forecast. With a the Fed constantly mentioning their concerns about weak US inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and how it imperils the chances of an interest rate rise before the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a miss the dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to indulge. Instead the greenback shed 0.2% against both the pound and the euro, while dropping 0.3% against the yen. This allowed the Dow Jones to continue its seemingly unstoppable march to daily all-time highs, with the index lurking just below 22900 following a 50 point rise. As for sterling, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a pretty inconsistent day. The currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managed to hold onto last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp rebound while struggling to maintain a steady grip on this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more modest growth. The inflation situation in the US allowed cable to keep above $1.33; against the euro, however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1265-crossing 9 day highs and sub-$1.12 lows, eventually settling just above that latter level with a 0.1% rise. More US data, and it looks like the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are in confident mood (see also the retail sales figures.) The monthly University of Michigan consumer sentiment index climbed from 95.1 in September to a preliminary reading of 101.1 for October. This is better than the dip to 95 which had been expected, and is the highest level since the start of 2004. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: The October gain was broadly shared, occurring among all age and income subgroups and across all partisan viewpoints. The data indicate a robust outlook for consumer spending that extends the current expansion to at least mid 2018, which would mark the 2nd longest expansion since the mid 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. While the early October surge indicates greater optimism about the future course of the economy, it also reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as it gets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times. ...Nothing in the latest survey indicates that consumers anticipate an economic downturn anytime soon - which contrarians may consider a clear warning sign of trouble ahead. Nonetheless, consumers anticipate low unemployment, low inflation, small increases in interest rates, and most importantly, modest income gains in the year ahead. It is this acceptance of lackluster growth rates in personal income and in the overall economy that signifies that consumers have accepted, however reluctantly, limits on the pace of improving prospects for living standards. The stronger US retail sales and hopes for positive company results have pushed US markets higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher to reach a new peak while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% to a record high. Not everyone believes a December US rate rise is a certainty, especially after this latest data. John Dolan, senior dealer at FEXCO Corporate Payments, said: In the space of just a week, all bets on a December rate rise are off and the US is further than ever from solving its inflationary puzzle. While a December rate hike had seemed a strong probability after last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid wage growth data, the picture now looks much more finely balanced. As this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC minutes revealed, the Fed remains deeply concerned about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation, or rather, the lack of it. Even though US wages are rising at a reasonable clip, consumer prices are still rising too slowly to require an immediate rate rise. Any December hike would therefore be driven by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to move rates back to more normal levels rather than by any inflationary imperative. While a final hike in 2017 remains a distinct possibility it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a done deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this uncertainty has weighed heavily on the Dollar, dragging it down against both the Euro and sterling. And from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on US inflation: More from the US Commerce Department on the retail sales: The dollar has weakened following the US data, in particular the inflation figures. But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank: Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic. The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations). In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher.... September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy. We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption. After all, the ISM manufacturing index is at a 13 year high, the dollar is making exports more competitive and we are seeing stronger global growth. With overall economic growth looking good, inflation pressures gradually increasing and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about asset valuations and financial stability becoming more prominent in speeches, a December rate hike is looking likely. The main risk remains the potential for an economically/market destabilising government shutdown. Meanwhile US retail sales have bounced back in September, albeit just shy of expectations: Newsflash: inflation across America rose last month, but by less than expected. Consumer prices increased by 0.5% in September, below the 0.6% which Wall Street expected. On an annual basis, US CPI rose by 2.2%, up from 1.9% a month ago. That puts it over the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of a 2% inflation rate. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like food and fuel, was flat at 1.7%. So, is bitcoin a sensible investment at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record levels, or should you keep well away? Cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many supporters will argue that City institutions are waking up to bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential (such as the ability to transfer money safely, securely, and cheaply worldwide). Two weeks ago, it emerged that Goldman Sachs has been considering whether to launch a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies. If that happens, it would arguably be the biggest endorsement yet from Wall Street. But critics argue that the recent rally is a bubble, that could burst if there is a rush to the exits. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investors, says anyone considering investing in digital currencies needs to be cautious: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The value of bitcoin has almost doubled in less than a month which is clearly attracting further interest from speculators. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of growing institutional activity, too, and if China reopens cryptocurrency exchanges after the Communist Party Congress which starts next week, some believe the price could reach $10,000 by the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there could be near-term turbulence around changes to the code the bitcoin network runs on, due to be implemented in mid-November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is crucial that retail investors understand the many risks involved in cryptocurrency trading, not least the volatility - bitcoin has lost more than a third of its value on two occasions since June. It is clearly not for the faint-hearted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pace of bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in recent weeks is quite remarkable. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quadrupled in value this year, despite faltering last month when China announced a crackdown on bitcoin exchanges. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been holding the World Bank to account at their Annual Meeting with the IMF in Washington: Bitcoin is having another one of those days. Having smashed through $5,000 for the first time yesterday, the cryptocurrency soared to $5,846 this morning before dipping back to $5,600 as I type. Last night, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said central bankers and regulators must take digital currencies such as bitcoin seriously, given the way they can disrupt the status quo. Many in the financial industry are struggling to come to terms with the rise of digital currencies, and unconvinced that bitcoin may be an unsustainable bubble. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan became the poster boy for the sceptics last month, when he declared that bitcoin was a fraud that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive. Yesterday he declined to take questions on the issue.... Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, argues that the blockchain technology which underpins bitcoin should be a useful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcutility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to improve the financial system operate. He told Bloomberg TV this morning: I can see that a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be useful in a blockchain context and speeding up interbank transactions. But, Sir Howard reckons that bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme volatility means it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a serious store of value for investors. UBS is also sceptical, saying bitcoin seems to be a bubble. But again, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re attracted to the blockchain -- the digital ledger that tracks digital transations. In a new report, they say: Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity since 2008, with more than 1,000 in existence today and an aggregate value greater than the market capitalization of IBM. But we are highly doubtful whether they will ever become mainstream currencies. The need for companies and individuals to pay tax receipts in government-issued currency, and the potentially unlimited crypto-money supply, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. We think the sharp rise in crypto-currency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble. But while we are doubtful cryptocurrencies will ever become a mainstream means of exchange, the underlying technology, blockchain, is likely to have a significant impact in industries ranging from finance to manufacturing, healthcare, and utilities. We estimate that blockchain could add as much as USD 300-400bn of annual economic value globally by 2027. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has been swept to a new alltime high today: China also hit a milestone for iron ore imports last month, as it bought more higher-quality stocks from abroad. Bloomberg has the details: Iron ore imports by China surged above 100 million metric tons to a record, smashing the previous high set in 2015, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerted push to clean up the environment stoked demand for higher-grade material from overseas while hurting local mine supply. Newsflash: Uber has filed an appeal against the decision to withdraw its licence to operate in London. The ride hiring app lodged its appeal in the courts this morning, ensuring that it can keep operating until the issue has been addressed. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judicial office has told Reuters that a heading could now take place on December 11, into Transport for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that Uber wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fit and proper company to operate in the capital. Today was the deadline for Ober to formally object to TfL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. An Uber spokesman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, Theresa May once again claimed the energy market was broken as she brought forward draft legislation for a price cap. But the big six suppliers, who have around 80% of the market, lost a record number of customers in September. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE collectively lost 163,000 customers over the month, up 127% on September 2016, analysis of official statistics showed. A significant chunk of those switchers would have been British Gas customers, prompted by the firm hiking electricity prices 12.5% for 3.1m customers. Experts at Jefferies bank said that with more than 1m people leaving the big six for challenger firms so far this year, 2017 will be a record year for switching. Next year could see that trend go into reverse, though, with households potentially lulled into complacency by the prospect of an upcoming cap. The FTSE 100 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sharing in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Stocks in London have dropped back from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, as the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery weights on exports. The Footsie is now down by 26 points at 7530. Other European markets are having a better day, though, helping to keep global stocks at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons shares could continue to climb. The bulls have the edge, and a strong US and European earnings should stand them into good stead for the rest of the year. Sterling is rallying this morning, thanks to signals that Britain and the EU might make progress in the Brexit talks. It has risen over $1.33 against the US dollar for the first time in almost two weeks, and is also recovering against the euro. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a turnaround from yesterday, when fears that talks had hit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeadlock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sent the pound sliding. That, though, was before it emerged that European leaders are expected to tell their negotiators to begin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal preparations for future trade talks with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says sterling is on a rollercoaster ride, thanks to a report that the EU are prepared to offer the UK a 2-year transitional deal. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly a fresh-take; a transitional period has been batted about since Brexit day dot. And [EU negotiator Michel] Barnier wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually that much of a doomsayer on Thursday, stating his belief that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was within reach in the next 2 months. But investors are being selective in what Brexit news they want to listen to, with this Handelsblatt report sending sterling sharply higher. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the Chinese economy seems to be in relatively good health, ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communist Party Congress. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data: The September Trade data painted an overall much stronger picture of domestic demand than many had been anticipating, and effectively made clear that the weaker August readings did not signal impending weakness. That said, some of the boost to imports was probably attributable to some front-loading of imports ahead of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Day/Autumn Festival holiday, with more working days this September probably also giving a boost. But the strength of commodity import growth (18.7% y/y) was across the spectrum, underlining the strength of domestic demand, and as much as Exports missed forecasts at 8.1% y/y, this was still a notable acceleration from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5.1%. The oil price has jumped this morning, as the markets react to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18.7% surge in imports. Brent crude has jumped by 1.5% to $57.07 per barrel, with traders anticipating higher demand for energy. Other commodity prices are also rallying, with nickel hitting a one-month high. Iron ore and copper are also up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade with North Korea slumped in September, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data, in a sign that United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang are being implemented. Chinese imports from North Korea fell by almost 38%, including imports of iron ore and coal according to customs spokesman Huang Songping. Chinese exports to North Korea also fell, by 6.7%. More details here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data might irk Donald Trump. According to Reuters, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the US has hit an all-time high. Reuters reports: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States in September rose to $28.08 billion versus $26.23 billion last month, Chinese customs data on Friday showed. The surplus was the highest ever with the U.S. for any single month, based on Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jan-Sept trade surplus with the U.S. was $195.54 billion, the data showed. That could give fresh ammunition to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has long complained that the trade imbalance between the two nations hurts the U.S. economy. The strong Chinese trade data sent MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All-Country World Share index up to a new peak, at 494.84 points. The index, which tracks equities across the globe, has been rising steadily this year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are touching new record highs this morning, after new Chinese trade data indicated the global economy was strengthening. China smashed forecasts overnight, reporting that imports surged by a remarkable 18.7% per year in September. Exports rose by 8.1%, a little below forecasts but still a solid result. The leap in imports suggests that Chinese factories are continuing to see strong demand for their products; an encouraging sign for world growth. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers will be pleased, as they prepare for next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communist Party Congress. This also means that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has narrowed, as Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capital, shows here: Chinese government officials have hailed the data, saying it shows the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is on track. CNBC has the details: Huang Songping, spokesman for the Customs department told a press conference on Friday that trade for the first three quarters improved due to a recovery in overall global and domestic economic environment. There has been a return in global demand, he added. Barring unforeseen events, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will post double-digit growth in foreign trade this year, said Huang. Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, called the data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems the global demand is still there to support the demand for Chinese exports.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees, saying: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data was fairly supportive of a fairly robust domestic economy. Asian stock markets rose to a 10-year high following the data, while Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei struck at 21-year high: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 joined the party last night, hitting a new record closing high. That was partly down to a weaker pound, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 also hit a new high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story: The Times also gave it a good show: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda for the day: 1.30pm BST: US inflation data for September. Prices are expected to have risen by 0.6% during the month. A strong reading raises the chances of a US interest rate rise. From 2pm BST: The IMF and the World Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Annual Meeting continues. Central bank chiefs, finance ministers, economists and investors will bd discussing the state of the global economy 3pm BST: The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer confidence report. 6pm BST: The weekly Baker Hughes oil rig count. A good measure of whether oil producers are ramping up output, or cutting back We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also have an eye on Bitcoin, which smashed through $5,000 to a record high yesterday.",

From midnight, the round pound coin, a British institution dating back to 1983, will pass its use-by date. Is cold, hard money going the way of the chequebook and the high-street bank&#xa0;branch?</p> <p>Certainly, the old pound coin as we knew it is for the scrap heap. It will lose its legal tender status and no longer be accepted in restaurants and shops except for a few including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/11/aldi-to-accept-old-1-pound-coin-for-two-weeks-after-deadline\" title=\"\">Tesco, Aldi and Poundland,</a> which say they will take it for a little while longer. Approximately \u00c2\u00a3500m worth of the coins are believed to still be in circulation.</p> <p>That is a lot of loose change. But official figures show the value of hard cash in the economy is increasing at a rapid rate. Annual growth in the run-up to last Christmas was the fastest in a decade, and the total value of all banknotes and coins has now surged to almost <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/fnc/2017/apr.aspx\" title=\"\">\u00c2\u00a383bn</a>.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than \u00c2\u00a31,200 in cash for every man, woman and child in the UK. Research shows the average person has about \u00c2\u00a377 in cash in their purse, pocket and at home. However, an increasing number have much more squirrelled away safely. And most of it is in \u00c2\u00a320 notes, which account for more than half of the total.</p> <p>But this is not a peculiar quirk of the British character. There are mountains of cash around the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although you would struggle to see them. There were <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currcircvalue.htm\" title=\"\">$1.5tn (\u00c2\u00a31.1tn)</a> of US dollars in circulation last year, an increase of 6% on 2015, with more than a trillion made up of $100 notes.

Millions of mattresses are being stuffed with notes around the globe.</p> <p>Mass cash stashing might signal a widespread fear of a looming apocalypse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, more prosaically, it could signal rampant illegality. The rapid growth in cash sloshing around the UK could be a warning sign for the economy, as banknotes can facilitate crime and tax evasion. In a nod to the doom-mongers, the Bank of England estimates some people could be hoarding money for a rainy day.</p> <p>Brexit could be one such downpour, according to economists at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, suggests <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/brits-are-hoarding-money-post-brexit-2016-9\" title=\"\">the growth in cash in the economy and the fall in the value of the pound since the referendum might not be coincidental</a>. And even a decade after the financial crisis, Bank of England analysis shows some people prefer not to store money at high street banks.</p> <p>David Fagleman, policy and research manager at Cash Services UK, which helps to coordinate the movement of money between banks, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are certainly aware that in previous times of economic uncertainty, people have gone back to cash. So it could well be something that happens again over the coming years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Growing levels of financial instability for households squeezed by state benefit cuts, sluggish wage growth and the rising cost of living could be encouraging the usage of cash too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/uk-banks-consumer-credit-credit-card-car-finance-loans-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">British banks are also planning the biggest squeeze on consumer credit since late 2008</a>, potentially exacerbating the squeeze.</p> <p>The statistics point to a significant section of the population for whom putting spare cash under the bed is unthinkable.

For these Britons, cash is not a hoardable unit of insurance but a day-to-day necessity that vanishes like water.</p> <p>Victoria Cleland, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief cashier, whose signature adorns newly-printed banknotes, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It tends to be that people who are less well-off will use cash as a budgeting technique. If you were in a situation where you saw more people were struggling, you would expect to see a higher demand for cash.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>But back to the bigger picture. Cash usage in general is falling because of the rise in technology, such as contactless payment methods. The proportion of payments using physical currency has declined from 62% of all transactions in 2006, to about 40% last year, with a <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/PUK-UK-Payments-Markets-2017-Summary-AW-Online%20(1).pdf\" title=\"\">further fall to about 21% expected by 2026</a>.</p> <p>Carl Packman, research manager at the poverty charity Toynbee Hall, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the rush towards better digital payments it would be an error to reduce access to cash.

This is a type of decentralised digital ledger of encoded information, which exists on a network and cannot be controlled by one of the machines plugged into it alone. DIGITAL WALLET The rise of online shopping has led to the development of digital wallets, which are online places to park money outside the traditional banking system. Paypal was an early version of this type of tool, most popularly used in conjunction with shopping on eBay. However, digital wallets can be used for spending elsewhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c online and offline. APPLE PAY AND ANDROID PAY Apple and Google both operate contactless payment systems via their smartphones. They are in effect digital wallets, allowing consumers to connect their traditional bank accounts to the payment system. While both allow consumers to make contactless payments using their mobile phones, they also enable payments online. TOTNES POUND A far more basic idea: the Devonshire town of Totnes, together with several other places in Britain such as Bristol and Brixton, has introduced local currencies. Part of the Transition Town movement, the currency is designed to keep money within the local economy for the benefit of the local community, small businesses and customers. The theory is that sterling and other major currencies can be easily withdrawn from one place and used or hoarded elsewhere, which can be potentially damaging to a local economy. Community currencies aim to foster greater links between producers and users, encouraging local development and cutting down on pollution caused by the transportation of goods from elsewhere. M-PESA Launched by Vodafone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kenyan associate, Safaricom, in March 2007, M-Pesa is a mobile phone-based money transfer system. It is hugely successful in Kenya and growing fast in other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including Afghanistan, Egypt, Albania and Tanzania -where access to traditional banking services can be limited. The service, now live in 10 countries, enables users to deposit money into an account stored on a mobile phone, as well as to send money to others and make payments and withdrawals. It also cuts street crime and corruption.",

                "body":"<p>Doug Robertson took an UberLux to his wedding. This is the ride-hailing app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-tier service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vehicles include Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and Bentley Flying Spurs. The driver made Robertson and his partner feel special, delivered them early and let the couple blast out Mama Cass on the stereo.</p> <p>Robertson, who is 28, is a big fan of Uber at a time when people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gig economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are becoming more divided and entrenched. This has become evident in the reaction to Transport for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to renew Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licence due to the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/uber-tfl-concerns-vows-keep-operating-london-licence\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153demonstrating a lack of corporate responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a> in relation to driver background checks and harassment claims.</p> <p>Over the weekend, I used at least three services that fall under the gig-economy umbrella: Uber, Deliveroo and TaskRabbit. Depending on your point of view, this makes me morally decrepit or simply someone getting on with their life in 2017. As millennials, Robertson and I are part of the generation most likely to use the services offered by the gig economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and most likely to be working in it. We are its beneficiaries and its victims.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/ursula-huws(5231f0dc-26ad-450e-925a-cf1f6629d5b5).html\">a preliminary report led by Ursula Huws</a>, a professor of labour and globalisation at Hertfordshire Business School, 50% of those working in what the report deems \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crowd work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK are under 35. At the same time, millennials are enthusiastic users of gig-economy apps and services, whether they are sorting out their laundry, ordering takeaway food or assembling furniture. One survey found that 57% of students in London would use Uber over a black cab, and its popularity extends to students in other cities. While<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/01/20/trust-in-business-media-and-ngos-is-going-down-everywhere/#72862e327fb6\"> trust in the media and many corporations and NGOs is diminishing</a>, millennials feel <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/geoff-smith/millennials-becoming-more-loyal-in-era-of-consumer-choice.html\">strong brand loyalty to gig-economy</a> companies such as Airbnb.</p> <p>When it comes to working in the gig economy, Huws is clear: young people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually in it by choice. While one in 40 say the gig economy provides the majority of their income, for most it is part of a piecemeal existence; they cannot find other work or they are subsidising other low-paid jobs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a high drop-out rate.</p> <p>Will Diggle, 22, is in the first year of a master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the Royal College of Music. A baritone singer living in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgustingly expensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd London in order to pursue his desired career, he works three three-hour shifts a week for Deliveroo, while also working as a barista. The pay from his Deliveroo gig mostly covers his food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then he has rent and tuition fees to cover. He knows of two fellow singers also working for Deliveroo, although one had his bike stolen and is now unable to work.</p> <p>Diggle organises his shifts in advance and is paid an hourly rate of \u00c2\u00a37, plus a \u00c2\u00a31 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drop fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for every delivery he makes. Other Deliveroo riders (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153roos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the company likes to call them) work on an ad-hoc basis, logging in to the app whenever they choose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c similar to Uber drivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and earning between \u00c2\u00a33.75 and \u00c2\u00a34.25 for each drop. Diggle prefers the hourly rate because he can align it with his college schedule. Also, if he has to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit around in the freezing cold on the street for two hours waiting for a delivery to come in, which happens so often\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then at least he is getting paid \u00c2\u00a314.</p> <p>Kieran Hughes, 27, also works for Deliveroo. He has been a rider in Brighton since December 2015; he has another job teaching drums and fairly low housing costs, because he acts as a property guardian (these are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/24/the-high-price-of-cheap-living-how-the-property-guardianship-dream-soured\">people who live without secure tenancy agreements for cheap rent</a>, often to guard empty properties from squatters). Hughes is on the Deliveroo drop rate and says he can make pretty good money if he has, say, four drops an hour. Like many, he was lured by the promise of flexibility. He says he quit a job in a canteen because of management bullying; at first the idea of not answering to a boss was liberating. But the only time riders can earn good money is in peak hours: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to be flexible around the times when the orders are there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not flexible for me to have to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday to make a living.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/24/inside-gig-economy-vulnerable-human-underbelly-of-uk-labour-market\">Inside the gig economy: the 'vulnerable human underbelly' of UK's labour market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The upsides of this sort of work have diminished over time. Huws says the golden age for the gig economy was some time around 2013, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/uber-drivers-protest-at-fee-hike-in-first-london-demo\">companies took a smaller cut</a> and there were fewer drivers/riders/factotums to compete with. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As Deliveroo pass on all risk to the rider, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to stop them over-recruiting in an area and flooding the city with riders, which is exactly what we saw last winter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Guy McClenahan, another Brighton rider (Deliveroo maintain that the hundreds of riders in the area earn on average well above the national living wage). Over time, Uber has increased the commission it takes from drivers while reducing fares. Drivers are finding themselves working much longer hours in order to make the same pay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or far less. (There are currently no time limits on how many hours Uber drivers can work a week in the UK, but the company is testing changes and says <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/273599/uber-cap-driver-hours-10-12-hours-within-24-hour-period-uk\">it plans to introduce limits over a 24-hour period</a>.) TaskRabbit, the online platform for handymen and odd jobs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/ikea-buys-taskrabbit-gig-economy-tradespeople\">which was recently bought by Ikea</a>, took away a rate in which contractors would earn more money for repeat commissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and buried that news in an email about introducing the option for clients to tip.</p> <p>I ask Robertson if he worries about the conditions for Uber drivers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Often, in spaces where companies are disrupting industry, there are going to be lots of new problems that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been discussed before,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have never felt guilty about using Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whenever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked to a driver about it, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been really positive about their work for the company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In London, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/05/uber-tfl-black-cabs-whats-missing-from-debate\">rallying cry of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must support our black cabs!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a> is loud, but they are eye-wateringly expensive. Some still do not take cards. One has to flag them down, or trek to a taxi rank. Contrast this with Uber, which offers lower prices; drivers who often carry bottled water, magazines, sweets and phone chargers; the option to play one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own music in the car; and drivers usually no more than five minutes away. Millennials are unfairly derided for many things, but they do have one unattractive characteristic: impatience. For the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153click-get\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd generation, being made to wait for a train or even a text message response for more than three minutes can feel like impertinence.</p> <p>Huws points out that the gig economy has always existed: cash-in-hand or on-call work or people turning up at building sites or dockyards in the hope of a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. But since the 2008 crash, jobs that provide a secure income have become harder to come by. It is true that the <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05871\">unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK is 12%</a>, while in parts of Europe it is 40%. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean much if many of those people are in precarious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the McKinsey Global Institute estimates this may be up to 30% of working-age adults across Europe. Huws says the notion of a career is being eroded, with young people often working a patchwork of different occupations. We laugh about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/30/george-osborne-six-jobs-economics-degree-manchester-university\">George Osborne having six jobs</a>; if he was a millennial, this would be par for the course.</p> <p>Huws worries about something else, too: the wellbeing of gig-economy millennial workers. This kind of employment can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really damaging for self-esteem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says. As Hughes and Diggle both say, crowd work can be lonely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Especially if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working a double shift,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Diggle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or sometimes you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel human. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just handing a bag over and some people take the bag, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at you and close the door. And then don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tip. One day I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be on stage singing, and the next I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delivering food on my bicycle and it does feel \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 deflating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In the past, a pat on the back from the boss might have helped. But the gig economy runs on ratings, and millennials talk of being stressed by the constant feedback. Unless they have done something very wrong, I always give my Uber drivers five stars, because I know that if their rating drops below a certain level they will be blocked from the app. The fear is real \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drivers often almost beg for a five-star rating at the end of a journey. Traditional full-time office workers may dread the annual appraisal, but many in the gig economy are being appraised every single day, or even multiple times an hour.</p> <p>And what if this system of ratings, likes and feedback leads to crippling anxiety? There is no sickness pay for the self-employed, no holiday leave, no insurance. There are other health concerns: for Diggle, this means waiting around in the freezing cold, then cycling for miles, or being exposed to pollution. For those on zero-hours contracts, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the experience of having to go into work if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sick, because these are the only shifts you have been allocated, and you are not sure when, or if, you will get more.</p> <p>It is convenient for businesses to treat people as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contractors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than employees because this way they avoid paying national insurance contributions (13.8% of an employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage). They also take on little to no liability. Deliveroo requests that its riders wear a helmet, and Diggle does, but he tells me this is not enforced. Riders pay \u00c2\u00a3150 for the kit (it used to be a deposit), and the company will provide bike lights, but riders provide their own bikes and there is no checking that the bike is suitable or road-safe.</p> <p>Outsourcing labour means companies have virtually zero duty of care. One driver for delivery company Hermes was sacked and told <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/10/hermes-sacked-driver-who-rushed-to-see-premature-baby-saying-parcels-come-first-6991044/\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153parcels come first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a> when he left a shift because of the premature birth of his child. Another Deliveroo rider in Dublin <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/life/dublin-deliveroo-worker-i-fell-off-my-bike-when-i-rang-the-call-centre-the-first-thing-they-asked-was-if-the-food-was-okay-35090382.html\">wrote an account in the Irish Independent</a> of taking a serious fall from her bike, and a Deliveroo customer services rep asking: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the food OK?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Diggle tells me that, when he has had issues, he has been able to call the customer service number and has spoken to someone helpful. All other communication with the company is via automated text.)</p> <p>This year, Maggie Dewhurst, the 30-year-old vice-president of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38534524\">won her employment-rights case against the courier firm CitySprint</a>, with the tribunal ruling that she should be classed as a worker rather than an independent contractor. IWGB is bringing a similar case against Deliveroo on behalf of its Camden cohort, fighting for minimum wage; the case is currently at the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Central Arbitration Committee. In Bristol, <a href=\"http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/deliveroo-riders-bristol-stage-strike-592142\">workers recently staged their own protest</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d32e9d1e1325ed64287c77204a468ecb8b90eff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d32e9d1e1325ed64287c77204a468ecb8b90eff/0_46_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie Dewhurst (far right) with other bike couriers campaigning against employment practices in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maggie Dewhurst (far right) with other bike couriers campaigning against employment practices in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Korycki/IWGB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dewhurst points out that the wider casualisation of work is a problem. She reckons about 50% of the union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members are millennials, although she stresses that the increase in political engagement among the young hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t automatically resulted in mass union membership. She says millennials are used to outsourced work, and are adaptable and resilient. More than that, argues Huws, they have grown up in a climate of unpaid internships and terrifying probation periods, the first generation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expected to work for free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For many, all they know is being part of the precariat. Or, as Huws puts it in no uncertain terms, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s model of the working poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>We think of the gig economy through the best-known apps: Uber, Airbnb, Deliveroo. But there are also listing sites such as Gumtree or Craigslist where people go to seek work. All of this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an enormously grey area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Huws, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and that makes it impossible to legislate for, until we have a definition of an online platform. One of the things we could do is make the onus on [the platform] to prove that they are not employment agencies, which would bring them into the scope of regulations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Offline, zero-hours contracts have become ubiquitous, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct, McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, hairdressing or nursing. (Jeremy Hunt announced at the Conservative party conference that <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-app-nurses-flexible-working-jeremy-hunt-gig-economy\">the NHS would even be trialling a flexible-working app</a>. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that there is some untapped reserve of labour in the NHS that can be unlocked with an app is pure fantasy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd <a href=\"http://www.gmb.org.uk/newsroom/nhs-gig-economy\">said the GMB union</a>.)</p> <p>Theresa May has promised to tackle the gig economy. In October 2016, she commissioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/18/taylor-review-gig-economy-workers\">a six-month review led by Matthew Taylor, </a>a former head of Tony Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy unit. One key thing the Taylor review did not recommend implementing was a guaranteed statutory minimum wage for each hour worked. Dewhurst believes that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as we stand now, we have more legal protection than we would if [Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] recommendations were implemented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The fundamental failing of the Taylor review, says Huws, is that it does not recognise that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the employment law we have, and the social security system in the UK, is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and that it needs to be redesigned ... We know there are genuine freelancers. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s define what that is in a much tighter way. Then everybody else is, by default, a dependent worker with certain rights. Put the onus on to the employer to prove why they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have those rights.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Obviously, the gig economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad. When work is truly flexible, and is provided by a responsible employer, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not when your work involves waiting for the phone call that will announce your next shift, or not being paid for overtime, or having to buy your own equipment.

                "bodyText":"Doug Robertson took an UberLux to his wedding. This is the ride-hailing app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-tier service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vehicles include Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and Bentley Flying Spurs. The driver made Robertson and his partner feel special, delivered them early and let the couple blast out Mama Cass on the stereo. Robertson, who is 28, is a big fan of Uber at a time when people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gig economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are becoming more divided and entrenched. This has become evident in the reaction to Transport for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to renew Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licence due to the company \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demonstrating a lack of corporate responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in relation to driver background checks and harassment claims. Over the weekend, I used at least three services that fall under the gig-economy umbrella: Uber, Deliveroo and TaskRabbit. Depending on your point of view, this makes me morally decrepit or simply someone getting on with their life in 2017. As millennials, Robertson and I are part of the generation most likely to use the services offered by the gig economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and most likely to be working in it. We are its beneficiaries and its victims. In a preliminary report led by Ursula Huws, a professor of labour and globalisation at Hertfordshire Business School, 50% of those working in what the report deems \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crowd work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK are under 35. At the same time, millennials are enthusiastic users of gig-economy apps and services, whether they are sorting out their laundry, ordering takeaway food or assembling furniture. One survey found that 57% of students in London would use Uber over a black cab, and its popularity extends to students in other cities. While trust in the media and many corporations and NGOs is diminishing, millennials feel strong brand loyalty to gig-economy companies such as Airbnb. When it comes to working in the gig economy, Huws is clear: young people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually in it by choice. While one in 40 say the gig economy provides the majority of their income, for most it is part of a piecemeal existence; they cannot find other work or they are subsidising other low-paid jobs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a high drop-out rate. Will Diggle, 22, is in the first year of a master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the Royal College of Music. A baritone singer living in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgustingly expensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd London in order to pursue his desired career, he works three three-hour shifts a week for Deliveroo, while also working as a barista. The pay from his Deliveroo gig mostly covers his food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then he has rent and tuition fees to cover. He knows of two fellow singers also working for Deliveroo, although one had his bike stolen and is now unable to work. Diggle organises his shifts in advance and is paid an hourly rate of \u00c2\u00a37, plus a \u00c2\u00a31 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drop fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for every delivery he makes. Other Deliveroo riders (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153roos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the company likes to call them) work on an ad-hoc basis, logging in to the app whenever they choose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c similar to Uber drivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and earning between \u00c2\u00a33.75 and \u00c2\u00a34.25 for each drop. Diggle prefers the hourly rate because he can align it with his college schedule. Also, if he has to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit around in the freezing cold on the street for two hours waiting for a delivery to come in, which happens so often\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then at least he is getting paid \u00c2\u00a314. Kieran Hughes, 27, also works for Deliveroo. He has been a rider in Brighton since December 2015; he has another job teaching drums and fairly low housing costs, because he acts as a property guardian (these are people who live without secure tenancy agreements for cheap rent, often to guard empty properties from squatters). Hughes is on the Deliveroo drop rate and says he can make pretty good money if he has, say, four drops an hour. Like many, he was lured by the promise of flexibility. He says he quit a job in a canteen because of management bullying; at first the idea of not answering to a boss was liberating. But the only time riders can earn good money is in peak hours: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to be flexible around the times when the orders are there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not flexible for me to have to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday to make a living.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The upsides of this sort of work have diminished over time. Huws says the golden age for the gig economy was some time around 2013, when companies took a smaller cut and there were fewer drivers/riders/factotums to compete with. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As Deliveroo pass on all risk to the rider, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to stop them over-recruiting in an area and flooding the city with riders, which is exactly what we saw last winter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Guy McClenahan, another Brighton rider (Deliveroo maintain that the hundreds of riders in the area earn on average well above the national living wage). Over time, Uber has increased the commission it takes from drivers while reducing fares. Drivers are finding themselves working much longer hours in order to make the same pay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or far less. (There are currently no time limits on how many hours Uber drivers can work a week in the UK, but the company is testing changes and says it plans to introduce limits over a 24-hour period.) TaskRabbit, the online platform for handymen and odd jobs, which was recently bought by Ikea, took away a rate in which contractors would earn more money for repeat commissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and buried that news in an email about introducing the option for clients to tip. I ask Robertson if he worries about the conditions for Uber drivers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Often, in spaces where companies are disrupting industry, there are going to be lots of new problems that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been discussed before,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have never felt guilty about using Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whenever I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked to a driver about it, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been really positive about their work for the company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In London, the rallying cry of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must support our black cabs!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is loud, but they are eye-wateringly expensive. Some still do not take cards. One has to flag them down, or trek to a taxi rank. Contrast this with Uber, which offers lower prices; drivers who often carry bottled water, magazines, sweets and phone chargers; the option to play one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own music in the car; and drivers usually no more than five minutes away. Millennials are unfairly derided for many things, but they do have one unattractive characteristic: impatience. For the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153click-get\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd generation, being made to wait for a train or even a text message response for more than three minutes can feel like impertinence. Huws points out that the gig economy has always existed: cash-in-hand or on-call work or people turning up at building sites or dockyards in the hope of a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. But since the 2008 crash, jobs that provide a secure income have become harder to come by. It is true that the unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK is 12%, while in parts of Europe it is 40%. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean much if many of those people are in precarious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the McKinsey Global Institute estimates this may be up to 30% of working-age adults across Europe. Huws says the notion of a career is being eroded, with young people often working a patchwork of different occupations. We laugh about George Osborne having six jobs; if he was a millennial, this would be par for the course. Huws worries about something else, too: the wellbeing of gig-economy millennial workers. This kind of employment can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really damaging for self-esteem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says. As Hughes and Diggle both say, crowd work can be lonely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Especially if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working a double shift,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Diggle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or sometimes you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel human. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just handing a bag over and some people take the bag, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at you and close the door. And then don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tip. One day I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be on stage singing, and the next I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delivering food on my bicycle and it does feel \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 deflating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the past, a pat on the back from the boss might have helped. But the gig economy runs on ratings, and millennials talk of being stressed by the constant feedback. Unless they have done something very wrong, I always give my Uber drivers five stars, because I know that if their rating drops below a certain level they will be blocked from the app. The fear is real \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drivers often almost beg for a five-star rating at the end of a journey. Traditional full-time office workers may dread the annual appraisal, but many in the gig economy are being appraised every single day, or even multiple times an hour. And what if this system of ratings, likes and feedback leads to crippling anxiety? There is no sickness pay for the self-employed, no holiday leave, no insurance. There are other health concerns: for Diggle, this means waiting around in the freezing cold, then cycling for miles, or being exposed to pollution. For those on zero-hours contracts, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the experience of having to go into work if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sick, because these are the only shifts you have been allocated, and you are not sure when, or if, you will get more. It is convenient for businesses to treat people as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contractors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than employees because this way they avoid paying national insurance contributions (13.8% of an employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage). They also take on little to no liability. Deliveroo requests that its riders wear a helmet, and Diggle does, but he tells me this is not enforced. Riders pay \u00c2\u00a3150 for the kit (it used to be a deposit), and the company will provide bike lights, but riders provide their own bikes and there is no checking that the bike is suitable or road-safe. Outsourcing labour means companies have virtually zero duty of care. One driver for delivery company Hermes was sacked and told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parcels come first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he left a shift because of the premature birth of his child. Another Deliveroo rider in Dublin wrote an account in the Irish Independent of taking a serious fall from her bike, and a Deliveroo customer services rep asking: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the food OK?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Diggle tells me that, when he has had issues, he has been able to call the customer service number and has spoken to someone helpful. All other communication with the company is via automated text.) This year, Maggie Dewhurst, the 30-year-old vice-president of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), won her employment-rights case against the courier firm CitySprint, with the tribunal ruling that she should be classed as a worker rather than an independent contractor. IWGB is bringing a similar case against Deliveroo on behalf of its Camden cohort, fighting for minimum wage; the case is currently at the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Central Arbitration Committee. In Bristol, workers recently staged their own protest. Dewhurst points out that the wider casualisation of work is a problem. She reckons about 50% of the union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members are millennials, although she stresses that the increase in political engagement among the young hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t automatically resulted in mass union membership. She says millennials are used to outsourced work, and are adaptable and resilient. More than that, argues Huws, they have grown up in a climate of unpaid internships and terrifying probation periods, the first generation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expected to work for free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For many, all they know is being part of the precariat. Or, as Huws puts it in no uncertain terms, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s model of the working poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We think of the gig economy through the best-known apps: Uber, Airbnb, Deliveroo. But there are also listing sites such as Gumtree or Craigslist where people go to seek work. All of this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an enormously grey area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Huws, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and that makes it impossible to legislate for, until we have a definition of an online platform. One of the things we could do is make the onus on [the platform] to prove that they are not employment agencies, which would bring them into the scope of regulations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Offline, zero-hours contracts have become ubiquitous, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct, McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, hairdressing or nursing. (Jeremy Hunt announced at the Conservative party conference that the NHS would even be trialling a flexible-working app. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that there is some untapped reserve of labour in the NHS that can be unlocked with an app is pure fantasy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the GMB union.) Theresa May has promised to tackle the gig economy. In October 2016, she commissioned a six-month review led by Matthew Taylor, a former head of Tony Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy unit. One key thing the Taylor review did not recommend implementing was a guaranteed statutory minimum wage for each hour worked. Dewhurst believes that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as we stand now, we have more legal protection than we would if [Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] recommendations were implemented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The fundamental failing of the Taylor review, says Huws, is that it does not recognise that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the employment law we have, and the social security system in the UK, is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and that it needs to be redesigned ... We know there are genuine freelancers. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s define what that is in a much tighter way. Then everybody else is, by default, a dependent worker with certain rights. Put the onus on to the employer to prove why they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have those rights.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obviously, the gig economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad. When work is truly flexible, and is provided by a responsible employer, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not when your work involves waiting for the phone call that will announce your next shift, or not being paid for overtime, or having to buy your own equipment. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can also mean contorting oneself into painful positions just to make ends meet. I want to enjoy Uber and not feel bad about it. As Dewhurst says, this is difficult when they appear to view fair treatment of those working for them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haemorrhaging money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And there are alternatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c CityMapper, for instance, has partnered with Gett and is trialling a flat-fare \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taxi-bus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to buy a bike and I already walk a lot. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to cook more and better, rather than using Deliveroo. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking out for start-ups such as PicFair, which utilises tech to help photographers reach the marketplace, while treating them fairly. But, for the time being, millennials remain shackled to the gig economy via addiction to its services and as one of the few ways to earn extra cash. I ask Diggle if he will continue riding for Deliveroo until the end of his course. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Then he changes his mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Actually, probably not. Because the longer you do this job, the less you like it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

The economy has confounded predictions of a sharp post-Brexit vote slowdown or recession, mainly because of resilient consumer spending.</p> <p>That is becoming harder to replicate as prices rise faster than wages, consumers become wary about adding to debts and banks restrict lending. Business investment failed to take off, as the economy recovered from the recession, and unwillingness to loosen corporate purse strings has contributed to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dire record on productivity, which has become the big bugbear.</p> <p>In July, when second-quarter GDP growth came in at 0.3%, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, blamed the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall after the Brexit vote for what he called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153painful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd squeeze on living standards and the slowing economy.

                "bodyText":"This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big economic number is GDP for the third quarter, due on Wednesday morning. Economists reckon output rose by 0.3% or 0.4% in the three months to the end of September. Assuming the figure isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lower than expectations, economy watchers will turn quickly to the underlying trends, such as business investment. The economy has confounded predictions of a sharp post-Brexit vote slowdown or recession, mainly because of resilient consumer spending. That is becoming harder to replicate as prices rise faster than wages, consumers become wary about adding to debts and banks restrict lending. Business investment failed to take off, as the economy recovered from the recession, and unwillingness to loosen corporate purse strings has contributed to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dire record on productivity, which has become the big bugbear. In July, when second-quarter GDP growth came in at 0.3%, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, blamed the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall after the Brexit vote for what he called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153painful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd squeeze on living standards and the slowing economy. Since then, Hammond has been a target for pro-Brexit Conservatives who have accused him of talking down the economy. Hammond has stuck to his guns so far but he risks a new onslaught if he continues to make the case against Brexit. Financial glass ceiling: yep, still there The Treasury committee has launched an inquiry into why so few women make it into senior jobs in finance. The first witness, on Tuesday, is Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money. Gadhia will no doubt have some personal insights but she could face stiff questions in her other role as the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s women in finance champion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost a year since she took up the post and nearly 100 financial firms signed up to a charter pledging to put women in senior jobs.

Starting at the top, Morgan wrote to the chancellor on Thursday asking for evidence that the Treasury is doing enough to hire women and people from ethnic minorities at the Bank of England.

It now expects to make \u00c2\u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure.</p> <p>The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p.</p> <p>The company said sales had stalled in the summer.

This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning has gone down very badly with the City, with traders unimpressed that the firm will only make \u00c2\u00a360m this year, not the \u00c2\u00a375m previously expected. David Madden of CMC Markets comments: The company announced that weak consumer demand has led to a drop in the number of people looking to purchase new cars. Pendragon anticipates the weakness in the new car market to remain until mid-2018. Shares in Pendragon have been in decline since January 2016, and the gap lower adds to the negative sentiment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some scepticism that things will pick up next year.... However, the wider market reaction is rather muted. The FTSE 100 ended the day up one point, or 0.02% at 7524. The pound is a little higher against the US dollar tonight too, at $1.321, despite the latest warning signs from the UK factory sector. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today.

Shares in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car dealer have plunged by 17% after a surprise profit warning which also raised new fears over consumer spending. The alert from Pendragon, which trades under the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone fascias, and sold 159,000 used cars last year, is the latest in a raft of profit warnings issued in recent weeks by UK companies blaming worsening consumer confidence. Pendragon, which sells all the main marques, said demand for new cars was sliding and the market had peaked. It now expects to make \u00c2\u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p. The company said sales had stalled in the summer. It now expects the new car market to continue to decline this year and into the first half of next year. Its chief executive Trevor Finn blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waning demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from consumers coupled with oversupply from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manufacturers with ambitious objectives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a very strong first quarter, a good second quarter and then demand waned ... in the big selling month of September and run-up to it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. September is a key month for car sales because number plates change. In the first six months of 2017, Pendragon made a profit of \u00c2\u00a348.5m, up 9.7% from a year earlier.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Just in: Eurozone consumer confidence has risen again - a sharp contrast with the UK today. Figures from the European Commission show that consumer morale beat forecasts this month, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery continued. Curiously, the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone consumer confidence index was still in negative territory, rising from -1.2 in September to -1.0 this month. The long-term average for this index is minus 10 in the euro area. Analyst firm Langton Capital is also worried that profit warnings could accelerate in the next few months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?! Over in New York, the US stock market has hit new record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq indices all struck new record levels at th start of trading. Traders are citing relief about last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Japanese election, which delivered a large win for prime minister Shinzo Abe. That means investors can can look forward to more money-printing and record low interest rates under Abenomics. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform plan has also been driving shares higher, even though experts warn that most of the benefits will go to the richest Americans. I mentioned earlier that UK profit warnings have jumped sharply, from 45 per quarter to 75. Well, the bad news is this trend will probably get worse if the British economy keeps slowing and Brexit talks keep stumbling, according to Pierre Bose of Credit Suisse. Reuters has the details: Pierre Bose, head of European equity strategy at Credit Suisse said more profit warnings from UK companies were to be expected if the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth continued to deteriorate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need results on the Brexit talks because from a corporate perspective, for investment spending, you need better clarity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. In a note, Credit Suisse said that despite the UK market benefiting from a global cyclical upturn, it faces significant economic and political challenges. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy news today, says Simon English in the Evening Standard. He writes: A hefty profit warning from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car dealer sent shares crashing nearly 20% and raised fears about the state of one of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important industries. Pendragon alarmed the market and City analysts with a sudden admission that too many cars are being made and consumer confidence has stalled. In The Times (\u00c2\u00a3), Robert Lea points out that Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits will be 20% lower than expected this year: Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest motor retailer went sharply into reverse after Pendragon finally admitted that it had been caught up in the decline in new car sales. The company, which trades under its Stratstone and Evans Halshaw showrooms, reported that profits this year will come in at about \u00c2\u00a360 million, nearly a fifth lower than last year. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Martin flags up (\u00c2\u00a3) that Pendragon is planning changes to halt its sales slide. The group said it is experiencing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the premium sector \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caused by certain manufacturers continuing to force vehicles into the market despite softening demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. CEO Trevor Finn set out steps that he hopes will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerate transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, including looking for a senior hire in the UK, considering a pullback from premium brands, and halting any new acquisitions in the US. It hints that it may pull out of the US altogether. The City analysts who track Pendragon have been pulling some screeching handbrake turns since its profits warning came out. Berenberg have lowered their recommendation for the stock to hold, from buy, and cut the price target from 46p to 26p. Canaccord Genuity have also cut their price target to 26p, from 36p. All perfectly understandable, but a little late - as Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by a sixth this morning, from 29p to 24p..... Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning is also fuelling fears that stocks of unsold cars in the UK are building up to dangerous levels. Accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young warned earlier this month that car dealers are sitting on 16% more unsold stock than they were just a year ago. The total of new cars gathering dust is now worth \u00c2\u00a327.3bn, up from \u00c2\u00a323.6bn last year. That helps to explain why Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial performance has deteriorated, as this big stockpile will put pressure on dealers Paul Daly, Partner at UHY Hacker Young, blamed auto manufacturers for pumping more new cars into the market, even though demand is slowing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Car makers continue to push more and more vehicles on to dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 books, but that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on indefinitely. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsustainable for unsold stock to keep rising so quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says chancellor Philip Hammond must help Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To boost investment growth, Government should use the Budget to provide a fillip for factories through business rate reforms, including exempting new plant and machinery from rates altogether, and switching to the more recognized CPI inflation measure rather RPI when calculating upratings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how UK firms are hunkering down and resisting buying new buildings: The recent slowdown in UK factory growth could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. So argues Simon French of Panmure Gordon: NEWSFLASH: UK factory order growth has slowed, and bosses are gloomier about future prospects. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey of British manufacturing, just released by the CBI (which represents UK business leaders). It found that optimism about business conditions fell in the last quarter, for the first time in a year. Worryingly, the survey found that growth in output, domestic orders and export orders also eased over the last three months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: 29% of businesses reported an increase in total orders, and 23% a decrease, giving a balance of +6%. Both domestic orders (+5%) and export orders (+12%) grew at a slower pace, albeit remaining above their long-run averages (-4% and -6% respectively) The CBI also found that companies are planning to cut back on investing in new equipment, and are also worried that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll struggle to find new staff. Investment intentions for the year ahead deteriorated, with spending plans for buildings at their lowest since July 2009. Expectations for spending on new equipment also weakened. Plans for investment in training and innovation remained much firmer by comparison. Concerns over labour shortages edged up from already high levels, with the number of respondents citing them as a limitation to investment plans at the highest since October 2013. Vertem Asset Management have summed up the situation... The slew of profit warnings from UK firms this autumn is becoming a serious concern. Too many companies, both big and small, have shocked the City in recent weeks by suddenly revealing unexpected problems - or a surprise deterioration in trading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of some of the gloom from this month alone: Merlin Entertainment, the theme park operator which owns Legoland and Madame Tussauds, warned that it experienced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It blamed recent terror attacks in the UK for scaring off customers, as it cut its profit expectations. Serviced office provider IWG saw a third wiped off its value last week after warning that sale were weaker than expected. A slowdown in London was partly to blame. Engineering firm GKN slashed its profit forecasts, due to problems at its US aerospace arm and two unexpected legal claims. Interserve, the construction and support services company, issued its second profit warning since the summer. The firm, whose public sector contracts include monitoring prisoners on probation, also warned it could breach its banking covenants Last week, The Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick Hoskins wrote that the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153duffers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 corner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is getting crowded, adding: It was only a few months ago that Britain was celebrating a seven-year low in the number of profit warnings. That benign period feels well and truly over. The incompetent and the unlucky are now having to fess up. And the share market is grumpily intolerant of any deviation from plan. Share prices are getting thumped. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that the car industry is facing some fundamental changes - from self-driving vehicles to a renewed clampdown on pollution. My colleague John Harris has written a good column on this issue today, which will not bring much cheer to Pendragon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: After a century in which the car has sat at the heart of industrial civilisation, the age of the automobile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of mass vehicle ownership, and the idea (in the western world at least) that life is not complete without your own set of wheels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looks to be drawing to a close. Top Gear is a dead duck. No one writes pop songs about Ferraris any more. The stereotypical boy racer appears a hopeless throwback. And in our cities, the use of cars is being overtaken by altogether greener, more liberating possibilities. The sale of diesel and petrol cars is to be outlawed in the UK from 2040. But only 10 days ago Oxford announced that it is set to be the first British city to ban all petrol and diesel cars and vans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from a handful of central streets by 2020, extending to the entire urban centre 1o years later. Paris will ban all non-electric cars by 2030, and is now in the habit of announcing car-free days on which drivers have to stay out of its historic heart. In the French city of Lyon, car numbers have fallen by 20% since 2005, and the authorities have their sights set on another drop of the same magnitude. London, meanwhile, has shredded the idea that rising prosperity always triggers rising car use, and seen a 25% fall in the share of journeys made by car since 1990..... Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning has prompted traders to dump the stock, says David Madden of CMC Markets. So, after their early plunge, Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still down almost 17% today at a four-year low. Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning is the latest in a series of blows to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector. So far this month, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned that: New car sales in the UK plunged by 9% in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sixth monthly fall in a row, leaving the market on course for its first annual decline since 2011. Vauxhall is cutting 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant in the North West of England. One in four workers will be laid off, as demand for its Astra drops. PSA Group, the French company which owns Vauxhall, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to new investment until Brexit negotiations have advanced. Spending across the UK car industry is on course to halve this year. The Mail on Sunday reported yesterday that just \u00c2\u00a3647m has been invested since the start of 2017, down from \u00c2\u00a31.66bn in 2016. Profit warnings are, by their nature, unexpected. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update from Pendragon is a particular surprise, as the company sounded so upbeat less than three months ago. Back on August 1st, Pendragon declared that it had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a clear path for growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after growing its underlying profits by almost 10% in the first half of 2017. Clearly, the summer and early autumn have been much more challenging than it expected. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning (online here) shows that Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new car business suffered at 20% fall in gross profits in the third quarter of this year. And with sales expected to keep falling into early 2018, it will take some time until profitability picks up again. Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used cars business has also suffered a 20% plunge in gross profits, due to the knock-on effect of the slowdown in the new car business. It says: This price correction, which was primarily focussed on some premium brands and therefore affected our Stratstone business, was a reaction to significant numbers of cars being registered and then sold into the market at significant discounts. This practice drives down the value of younger cars in the market and nearly new inventories (eg dealer demonstrators and loan cars). City analysts are now demanding answers.... Shares in Inchcape, a rival car dealership,have fallen by 4% in early trading. That shows that traders believe Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are part of a wider malaise in the UK economy. The City of London is most unimpressed by Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent performance, says retail analyst Nick Bubb: The profit warning from the normally bullish Pendragon group will go down like a lead balloon in the City today and put pressure on the other Motor dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are on track for their worst day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in eight and a half-year, says Reuters. Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning is the latest sign of weakness in the UK economy, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. He writes: British car dealership chain Pengdragon plunged nearly 20% after warning on full-year profit, the company struggling with the declining demand for new cars and the impact this has had on the used car market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign of retail-woe in the UK, especially among companies dealing with big ticket items, as the household spending squeeze continues. The Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City expert, Simon English, is aghast at Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning: In another surprise development....Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Mel Egglenton, has stepped down for personal reasons, with immediate effect. The company has appointed Chris Chambers, the senior independent director, to replace him. Shares in Pendragon have plunged by almost 20% at the start of trading. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slumped to their lowest level in over four years, as investors react to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning from the car dealer. Pendragon, the UK car dealership firm, has sent a shiver through the City this morning by issuing a profits warning. The company, which runs the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone outlets, says that demand for new cars has slumped in recent months, driving down the value of second-hand cars as well. Pendragon, which is one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest dealers, blames a fall in consumer confidence. It told shareholders that: The decline in demand for new cars and the consequent used car price correction has impacted this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit outturn..... During the quarter as consumer confidence waned we experienced significant market pressures. Pendragon, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest listed car dealer, now expects to post full year underlying pre-tax profits of just \u00c2\u00a360m, down from expectations of around \u00c2\u00a375m. Official figures have shown that UK car sales have been falling for the last six months, as people have cut back on big-ticket items. Pendragon fears that this trend will continue: In the premium sector we have experienced unprecedented pressure on new vehicle margin caused by certain manufacturers continuing to force vehicles into the market despite softening demand. We expect new car registrations to continue to reduce for the remainder of this year and into next year with the volume franchise reductions easing first, followed by a normalisation of the registrations of premium vehicles. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy news from Pendragon is the latest in a series of profit warnings. UK-listed businesses have issued 75 profit warnings in the last quarter, up from 45 between April and June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest quarterly rise in nearly six years, according to accountancy firm EY. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, when the CBI issues its monthly industrial trends report. Last month, the survey showed that manufacturing was holding up well, with output growing and exports \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Political drama could also move the markets today, as the Catalonia crisis rumbles on. The ball is back in the Catalan parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court, after the Spanish government in Madrid triggered 155 of the Spanish constitution, imposing direct rule. Could Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia, respond by declaring independence?... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more stability in Japan, where Shinzo Abe is celebrating a general election win. Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito have retained their super-majority, sending the Japanese Nikkei rallying, for its 15th day in a row - a new record. This means that Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abenomics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd growth strategy, based around ultra-loose monetary policy, will probably continue. He is also expected to try to reform Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitution, including its pacifist Article 9 which limits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces to self-defence. European markets are expected to open cautiously: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 11am: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bundesbank releases its monthly report. 11am: CBI industrial trends report for October. 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence report",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a very cheery picture this month: And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A quiet day in the City ended with the FTSE 100 up just 20 points. Mining firms had a good day, led by Antofagasta which gained 2.8%. Whitbread led the fallers, though, after the slowdown at its Costa Coffee chain disappointed analysts. Some were also concerned that the occupancy rate at its Premier Inn hotel chain had slowed. The pound has also lost ground, and is now down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.3128. Bad news 2: World wine production has dropped to a 50 year low, after spring frosts and summer heatwaves ravaged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tender vines. Bad news 1: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountain of consumer debt is reaching dangerous levels, according to credit rating agency S&amp;P. Back to gender equality in the City, or rather the lack of it. My colleague Jill Treanor reports that two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks - Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan- haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet signup to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new charter aimed at addressing the issue.... Newsflash from America: US companies are growing at a faster rate this month. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity at US factories, has jumped to 54.5 in October, from 53.1 last month. The services sector also picked up pace, with its PMI rising to 55.9 from 55.3. That implies that the US economy continues to grow at a healthy rate. Over in Moscow Cyprus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 head of state Nikos Anastasiades is holding talks with president Vladimir Putin on the second day of an official visit aimed at strengthening economic ties between the two countries. Cyprus is without doubt Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friendliest EU member state and this afternoon the Greek Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades went out of his way to make the point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I may say that this visit is in the framework of those fine relations between the Republic of Cyprus and the Russian Federation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anastasiades making his third visit to Moscow since becoming president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to inform the Russian leadership about recent developments in the Cyprus issues, discuss issues related to ties with the European Union and Russia, essential regional issues and the possible role of Cyprus in solving them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek Cypriot leader is expected to sign a number of treaties with Putin raising the total number of bilateral agreements to 67. A joint action plan for the period 2018-2020 will seek to reinforce, political, economic, defence and energy ties between the two with ministers from both countries signing pacts on maritime and road transport, communications and information technology. The Cypriot government is also seeking to raise the number of Russian tourists from 900,000 to one million over the coming year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are constantly striving towards improving air connectivity between our two countries, which in principle is one of the major priorities of my government, and also focusing on enhancing the experience for Russian tourists by offering more and more qualiuty services,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anastasiades said. More than 40,000 Russian citizens live permanently on Cyprus, prompting the community to field a Russian party in presidential elections due early next year. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results have helped to send the US stock market to fresh record highs, once again.... Caterpillar, the machinery and construction giant, has smashed Wall Street forecasts. The firm, famous for its yellow diggers, hiked its profit forecasts and announced that revenues had surged by 25% to $11.4bn in the last quarter. Caterpillar, which is a good barometer for the global economy, reported growing strength in a number of areas, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector and North America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil and gas industry. Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones &amp; Co, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Results were better than expected across the board, with construction, mining, energy all strong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This has sent the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares up by over 6%, to a new all-time high. John Mann MP has now issued a statement, criticising the Bank of England for not appointing more women to top jobs (an issue raised earlier). He argues that the BoE should widen its recruitment pool - perhaps even adding a trades union leader such as Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady to the monetary policy committee.... Mann says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last week, the appointment of Sir Dave Ramsden to the Deputy Governorship at the Bank of England was confirmed. It is shameful that when so many talented women are at the forefront of the private sector, the trade union movement and the academic world, institutions like the Treasury and the Bank of England keep turning to the same group of men to fill their appointments. I hope to see an increasingly diverse range of nominees come before the Treasury Committee as new vacancies arise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, it has appointed several women to the MPC in recent years, such as Kristin Forbes and Minouche Shafik. Both have since left, though, leaving the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top committees looking terribly male (apart from the newly appointed Silvana Tenreyro, of course). Speaking of Greece.... the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout review began in earnest today. And, for once, the visit by international monitors appears to have got off to a good start! Helena Smith reports from Athens. A first round of talks between inspectors representing debt-stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international creditors and finance ministry officials has begun in optimistic mood. A senior finance ministry source said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected primary surplus would well exceed 1.75% of GDP in 2017. That would underline how fiscal indicators have improved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and boosts hopes that the review will be wrapped up without negotiations becoming tortuous or prolonged. Greek government sources have welcomed the European Stability Mechanism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that a decision will finally be made on Thursday as to whether Athens should receive a remaining bailout disbursement of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800m in aid. Release of the funds will ultimately depend on progress the Greek state had made in clearing arrears. Late Monday the normally acerbic Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem echoed the optimism telling an audience in Ireland that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme was back on track and that fellow eurozone members were prepared to do more to manage the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt mountain if called for. Dijsselbloem declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have managed to help the debt burden, a lot has been done there. We stand ready, if they do their part, to do more if necessary. At the end of the programme in the summer next year, we will look again at how sustainable the debt is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has formally stepped down as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister and taken up a new position as president of the Bundestag. And to mark the occasion, hundreds of finance ministry staff assembled themselves into a big fat zero for a photo which was presented to Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble last night. That may sound like a curious move - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a tribute to Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to balance Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and deliver a zero deficit. Countries who suffered badly during the eurozone crisis might feel a different send-off is in order, given Schauble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to Greece getting debt relief. Marcus Walker of the Wall Street Journal reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hidden meaning behind the photo. Sir Jon Cunliffe isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only BoE policymaker sounding wary of raising interest rates next month. Last week, fellow deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden revealed that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the majority of MPC members who felt, in September, that a rate rise was close. The Bank, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raised interest rates for a decade, will remember the experience of the European Central Bank; it hiked, prematurely, in 2011, and was later forced to cut into negative territory to stimulate the economy. But, having insisted several times that a rate hike is coming, can governor Mark Carney really fail to deliver? He already has a reputation as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, having abandoned his earlier forward guidance on when rates would go up. As Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Goodman puts it: Carney also has to worry about credibility. He has previously come under fire for hinting at rate increases that never arrived, with one lawmaker branding him an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2014. That label has stuck with him ever since, and, even though he has stuck resolutely to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd language in recent comments, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under pressure to deliver this time. Sterling has fallen a little this morning, following BoE deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words about interest rates. The pound has lost a quarter of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.317, and a similar amount against the euro to below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Traders are taking note of Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that he might not vote to raise borrowing costs at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, as UK growth is weak and real wages are falling. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, says Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have put the pound under pressure: Analysts have typically favoured the pound as the likelihood of a rate rise increases, and so any signals to the contrary could weigh on sterling. Incidentally, this chart shows how the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum caused a spike in inflation, and a long-term impact on prices too.... Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia also told the Treasury committee about how sexism used to be rife in the financial sector. She explained that during her time at Royal Bank of Scotland.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a very male culture and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked previously about part of that being the sort of win-lose culture. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Undoubtedly there was a pervading sexism where I remember a very senior woman being very upset one day telling me that she was expected to sleep with her boss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That sort of thing of course means that there are issues for women in progressing through financial services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC has more details. Jayne-Anne Gadhia also suggested there was no excuse for the Bank of England not to have a decent number of women in senior positions. Currently the Financial Policy Committee is entirely male, while Silvana Tenreyro is the only woman on the Monetary Policy Committee. But, Gadhia tells the Treasury Committee, women such as (IMF chief) Christine Lagarde and (Fed chair) Janet Yellen have proved that gender is no barrier. John Mann MP agrees.... Over in parliament, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money, has been discussing how to tackle gender imbalances in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. She told the Treasury committee that Virgin Money have used blind recruitment processes to give all applicants a fair chance, and training to help staff avoid their own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunconscious biases\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She argues that a senior manager, such as the chief executive, needs to be held accountable for helping address gender imbalances, and pay disparities. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her four-part plan: A clear strategy for tackling workplace inequality Make it measurable Make someone responsible for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at 70% of firms it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the CEO Attach someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus to it Gadhia says that she asks for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced recruitment lists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for senior positions, to give a roughly equal number of men and women to choose between. Gadhia adds that the companies who are tackling gender inequality best are those who treat it as a business issue, not simply an HR one - and implement policies such as flexible working. This is an important issue for Gadhia, who was appointed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender diversity Champion last year. She says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pleased that the Bank of England has just signed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Women in Finance Charter. Some major firms still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the list, though, she adds.... Newsflash: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective government debt pile has shrunk, as a percentage of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Eurozone government debt was equal to 89.1% of GDP at the end of June, down from 89.2% in the first quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite a rise in the annual deficit in the second quarter of the year: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers report shows that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is still strong, says economist Rupert Seggins: Jon Ferro of Bloombeg points out that manufacturing is leading the way: But the team at Sigma Squawk are concerned that the service sector slowed this month: Newsflash: Companies across the eurozone are growing at a slower rate than expected this month. The Composite Purchasing Managers Index has dropped to 55.9, down from 56.7 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a weaker reading than expected, but still shows solid expansion (anything over 50 shows growth). Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is having a good month - with the manufacturing PMI accelerating to 58.6, from 58.1. That suggests that activity is rattling along. But the services PMI dropped to 54.9, from 55.8 - a weaker reading than forecast. Markit reports that Germany and France were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth drivers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while peripheral countries lagged behind. Whitbread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Britain is entering a third wave of coffee drinking, and happy to pay more for more complicated brews, might amuse their rivals at McDonalds..... Whitbread shares have fallen by over 4% in early trading, as traders react to the slowdown in sales and falling profits at its Costa Coffee chain. Like-for-like sales at Costa only rose by 0.1% in the three months to 31 August, in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the company reported this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty sharp slowdown -- sales grew by 1.1% in the previous quarter. And it hit the bottom line -- statutory pre-tax profit at Costa fell by almost 10% in the last six months, from \u00c2\u00a365m to \u00c2\u00a359m. This has sent Whitbread sliding the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, despite reporting a 7% rise in underlying profits across its business (which includes Premier Inn hotels). Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Whitbread is suffering from rising cost pressures and a slowing economy: Whitbread will be well aware of the pressures facing the purses of UK consumers. Weaker like-for-like numbers this time round will add to worries that customers are feeling the pinch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love affair with coffee (yum yum!) fading? Not according to Whitbread; they reckon we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthird wave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is... a period in which consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences for coffee become more sophisticated and are willing to spend more per cup for higher quality and innovative drinks.

Sign up here. Sir Jon Cunliffe also warned European cities that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knock London off its perch as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre, despite Brexit. He told the Western Mail that some City banks will move operations over the Channel, or even the Atlantic, once Britain leaves the European Union. That could be bad news for jobs and tax receipts down the line. But this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin can supersede London, Cunlifee argues: We have an expertise in financial services and we have a critical mass of talent and deep knowledge and those sort of big economic agglomerations and economic activity exist because they add value and they reduce costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may be that some activities that are carried out in London have to move to the continent. And maybe some activities carried out in London no longer become efficient, and rather than moving to the continent, they just go back to New York or somewhere else, or maybe they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen at all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see London as a financial centre being replicated on the continent anytime soon as it takes an awful lot of critical mass of expertise and knowledge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top policymakers has cautioned against assuming that UK interest rates will rise next month. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor at the BoE, says that with the UK economy suffering weak growth it is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open question\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whether the Bank will raise borrowing costs in November. Speaking on a trip to Wales, Cunliffe told the Western Mail that UK workers are suffering falling real wages (due to the spike in inflation since the Brexit vote). And while interest rates are certain, in his view, to be higher in three years time - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no guarantee that the first hike in a decade is imminent. Mr Cunliffe told the Western Mail that the UK economy has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly slowed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that any rate rises will be gradual. As he put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our August forecast we forecast that rate of growth [GDP] of about 1.5% a year, and it is going to continue for the next two to three years. And pay is going to gradually pick up from around 2% to around 3.5% by the end [three year forecast period]. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that is going to put some domestic pressure on inflation, as the imported inflation eases off. Now if that forecast comes to pass over the forecast period, interest rates will need to go up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They will not need to go up by as far and as fast as they did before the crisis, but over the forecast period of three years rates will need to rise. The exact timing of when that starts? Well, that for me is a more open question.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting is on November 2nd. Back in the summer, we got several hints that the MPC was close to voting to raise rates from their record low of 0.25%. But, with Brexit uncertainty weighing on companies, and wages only rising by 2.1% per year (compared to inflation at 3%), perhaps the committee is having second thoughts.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get our first insight into how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing this quarter, with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey of purchasing managers at companies across the eurozone. City analysts expect to learn that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and service sector companies are still expanding steadily this month. The headline eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at 56.5 for October, down slightly on September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 56.7, but still showing strong growth. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada explain: The PMIs ended the second quarter higher than they begun it, suggesting some pick-up in momentum toward the quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end and the continued strength of new orders in both the manufacturing and services sectors suggests that should continue into the third quarter. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee is holding an inquiry into women in finance (why there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more of them, and why more don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise to the top). Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money, will give her insight. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning from UK car dealer Pendragon, the City is chewing through results from hotels and coffee chain Whitbread, packaging firm Bunzl, carpet seller Carpetright and publishing group Bloomsbury. There don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any shockers, although Whitbread has only reported a small rise in sale at Costa Coffee. Financial analyst Chris Bailey has helpfully summarised the details: Any ideas?...

The market expects rates to be increased for the first time since July 2007. Horta-Os\u00c3\u00b3rio said a rate rise would not put \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the economy and would merely be an unwinding of the emergency rate cut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made in the immediate aftermath of the vote for Brexit. Prior to that, rates had been at 0.5% since March 2009. With inflation running at 3%, real interest rates would remain negative, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Asset quality remains strong, reflecting our prudent approach to risk, while the UK economy remains resilient,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Horta-Os\u00c3\u00b3rio said. The bank is back under private ownership after the government sold off the last of its shares in May, after taking a 43% stake during the height of the 2008 crisis. It is focused on the UK market and has started to expand in the credit card market, buying MBNA last year, giving it a market share of 26%. It has a 25% share of current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages. It is also a player in the motor finance market but Horta-Os\u00c3\u00b3rio sought to calm concerns about the consumer credit market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c car loans, credit cards and personal borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c saying the bank took a conservative approach to its lending. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned on Tuesday that the rise in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer debt to \u00c2\u00a3200bn was unsustainable. The Bank of England will tell lenders next month how much extra capital they need to hold to counter the risk. The bank did admit it was expecting an increase in its capital requirement but finance director George Culmer said it still expected to pay a dividend for the full year and would consider the use of buy-back or special dividend at the end of the financial year. Lloyds made profits of \u00c2\u00a34.5bn in the first nine months of the year, helped by the absence of provisions for payment protection insurance or fines in the third quarter for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. Claims for PPI, though, are running faster than the bank had expected following an industry-wide advertising campaign featuring The Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to raise awareness of the 2019 deadline for making complaints about the mis-sold insurance product. The bank is yet to use \u00c2\u00a32.9bn of its \u00c2\u00a318bn PPI provision \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest in the industry. It received 16,000 complaints a week after the campaign was launched and although this has fallen back to 11,000 a week it is higher than the 9,000 a week it had forecast. Impairment charges for bad loans rose 20% to \u00c2\u00a3539m but Culmer said this was not caused by a deterioration in consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to repay loans but a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153single large corporate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd running in to trouble.",

                "bodyText":"The stronger than expected UK growth figures have given a lift to the pound on the basis that an interest rate rise next week is almost certain. With sterling up nearly 1% against the dollar, the FTSE 100 has fallen back thanks to its host of overseas earners which lose out when the pound is stronger. German and French markets also fell back as investors took profits, while Wall Street came back from its record highs after a handful of disappointing results. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 79.33 points or 1.05% at 7447.21 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.46% to 12,953.41 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.37% at 5374.89 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.81% to 22,446.39 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.51% lower at 10,153.3 But in Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.01% to 737.25 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 164 points or 0.7%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are accelerating, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 95 points or 0.4%. Following its recent record breaking run, any disappointment in the host of earnings reports coming out looks like an excuse for some profit taking. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The recent US stock market surge came to a halt today, as the positive earnings releases of days gone by were nowhere to be seen. With 70% of S&amp;P 500 earnings beating estimates, it is no surprise that confidence has been sky high of late. However, given the underperformance of AT&amp;T and Boeing earnings, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a shock that the wider S&amp;P 500, Dow and Nasdaq markets are all in the red as we realise that further earnings outperformance may not be a given. Sterling remains strong against the dollar, now up nearly 1% at $1.3261. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound continued to romp higher this Wednesday, as investors indulged in a hawkish view of the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK third quarter GDP reading. Despite a better than expected pair of durable goods orders figures from the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the core reading rose to 0.7%, while the non-core number hit 2.2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cable widened its gains as the day went on. All this put the FTSE in a miserable mood, with the UK index dropping 50 points to fall to its lowest price in nearly 3 weeks. With the likelihood of a November rate hike from the BoE only increasing following the (slightly) better than forecast third quarter growth reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving sterling in line for another boost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK index may struggle to muster the momentum required to climb back, and stay, above 7500 in the coming weeks. US home sales for September have jumped sharply to the highest level in a decade, confounding expectations of a small decline. After their recent record breaking run, US markets have paused for breath. A handful of companies including Chipotle and AMD released underwhelming updates, giving investors an excuse to hold fire after what has up until now been a positive earnings season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 2 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 2.79 points lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 10.62 points. Back with UK GDP, and here are chancellor Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thoughts on the figures: On the latest US data, Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: President Trump will be heartened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s durable goods orders, which have come in well above expectations and point towards a manufacturing sector performing strongly, despite an uncertain economic backdrop. The challenge for Trump will be maintaining this momentum, with a big decision due in the coming weeks on the future Janet Yellen as Fed chair. Having run on a jobs platform during last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, the president will also need to find a way of ensuring that strong manufacturing performance leads to an uptick in job and wage growth. Over in the US, there have also been some better than expected economic figures. New orders for US made capital goods - excluding defence and aircraft - jumped 1.3% in September, better than the 0.5% rise expected by analysts. The August figure was also revised upwards, from an initial 1.1% to 1.3%. The data comes ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third quarter GDP estimate, which is expected to show an impressive annualised rate of 2.5%, albeit down from the second quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3.1%. The positive figures will add to the expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates again before the year end. OK, time for a quick catch-up on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew a little faster than expected in the third quarter of this year, but still below its long-term growth rate. GDP rose by 0.4% in July-September, ahead of City expectations. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an increase on the 0.3% growth recorded in the first two quarter of 2017, but still a fairly moderate performance. The service sector, which makes up around three-quarters of the economy, grew by 0.4%. Manufacturing, encouragingly, grew by 1% during the quarter. But construction suffered its second quarterly contraction in a row. Darren Morgan, the Office for National Statistics Head of National Accounts, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth in the third quarter of 2017 continued at a similar rate as seen in the first half of the year. Services, led by increases in IT, motor trades and retail, continued to drive GDP growth. Manufacturing also boosted the economy with an improved performance after a weak second quarter. Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continued to outperform expectations. But his Labour opposite number, John McDonnell, criticised the government for not investing more. City economists have generally agreed that the UK economy looks somewhat lacklustre. Several blamed the Brexit vote, for cutting the value of the pound and deterring firms from investing in new machinery and buildings. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg sums up the mood: The current pace of UK GDP growth is ok, but it could be better. While the short-term risks to demand since the Brexit vote have not materialised in a serious way, the UK economy should be riding high on the back of the on-going global upswing. Uncertainty from Brexit is weighing on firm and household confidence. The forecast-beating growth figures appear to increase the chances of an interest rate rise next week. That sent the pound rallying almost 1% today. This has pulled down Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 share index, as a stronger pound undermines the value of overseas earnings. Sterling has now gained a whole cent against the US dollar today, to $1.325. City investors seem increasingly confident that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week, on the back of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures. An interest rate rise would help savers, but could be bad news for over-stretched borrowers. With real wages shrinking this year, many households have been forced into debt to pay for basic items. Fran Boait, director of the Positive Money campaign group, argues that interest rate shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise until wages have caught up with inflation. With many people already drowning in debt, even a small increase in mortgage rates and credit card bills could push them under. People urgently need a boost to their incomes before any rise in interest rates. Our message to the Bank of England and the government is that there should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No rate rise without a pay rise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Difficult times call for radical measures...and Labour MP Liam Byrne argues that Britain needs to rethink its economic model to get growth motoring again. Writing in the Guardian, Byrne says: London is an incredible 40% more productive than Wales. And in contrast to the shibboleths of traditional growth theory, our regions are failing to converge over very long periods of time. A bold new model would grant new fiscal freedoms to regions to borrow to invest in infrastructure and housing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as first proposed by the Keynes-inspired 1944 white paper on full employment. Devolution of the apprenticeship levy would rescue a failing policy and allow regions to coordinate technical education. And a radical boost to the Higher Education Innovation Fund would transform the power of regional universities to provide research and development to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underproductive small business base. However elegant the strategy, said Winston Churchill, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to occasionally look at the results. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic results are disappointing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to change the theory and practise of the strategy. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Group, says the big picture is that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has slowed over the last decade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity - a problem that no-one seems close to solving. But Brexit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, he writes: Increased uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationships, regulations and migration policy have led many firms to put investment on hold. The British economy has no doubt performed better than many analysts (including this one) expected since the referendum, but that performance still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be termed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is important to remember that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better-than-expected performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c relative to the most pessimistic pre-Brexit vote views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has come at a time when the global economy as a whole has been putting in a stronger performance. This month the International Monetary Fund estimated that the global economy would grow 3.6% in 2018 and that advanced economies would expand by 2.2%. Those numbers compare to estimates of 3.2% and 2.0% before June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Meanwhile they now pencil in growth of just 1.7% for the UK next year as opposed to an estimate of 2.2% 18 months ago. In other words, while the prospects for the world economy and other developed countries have improved, our own outlook has darkened. More here: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that the (small) pick-up in UK growth over the summer will persuade the Bank of England to raise interest rates next week. UK government bond prices have fallen since the GPD figures came out. This has pushed the interest rate (or yield) on 10-year UK debt to 1.41% - on track for its highest level since January. This is another sign that the City expects UK interest rates to rise soon (so investors are selling UK bonds and buying higher-yielding assets). Chancellor Philip Hammond has told reporters in London that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continued to outperform expectations. Reuters has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid performance by the UK economy in the third quarter and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outperformed market expectations as the UK economy has done overall since the referendum last year. What it shows is the underlying fundamental strength of this economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said in televised comments to British broadcasters. Hammond has also been admiring Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life sciences industry, at the Francis Crick Institute: Labour MP Chris Leslie, who supports the Open Britain campaign, says inflation and Brexit uncertainty are holding growth back: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures show the damaging impact Brexit is already having on the economy, with workers and consumers feeling the squeeze in lower wages and higher prices. Leslie adds that the UK needs to negotiate membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, rather than risk crashing out of Europe without a deal.... Incidentally, the latest word from parliament is that MPs might not get a vote on Brexit until after the UK has left the European Union! A funny way of taking back control.... The pound continues to push higher, now up 0.8 of a cent at $1.322, as the City continues to price in a rate hike next month. But...Dr Gordon Fletcher of University of Salford Business School fears that a UK interest rate rise could undermine the recovery. He writes: Growth is now weaker compared to the other major European economies and could itself be seen as tangible result of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The past decade has also been a time of historical low interest rates and now concern will turn towards the prospect of an imminent rise in this rate. A rate rise could then be a disincentive in a relatively weak economy to further business growth and expansion. It is a fine balance. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, is pleased to see that manufacturing output rose by 1% during the quarter. As the backbone of our economy, the onus is now on the government to ensure that investment continues despite Brexit uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says the UK economy has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost its sparkle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and put in another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclacklustre performance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the last quarter: She fears that growth will remain subdued while Brexit plays out... There has been a deterioration in economic performance since the start of the year, as inflation has begun to bite and consumers have started to reconsider their priorities. This trend is likely to remain for a while, with Brexit related uncertainties looming large for consumers and businesses. Our expectations are therefore for annual GDP growth to fall short of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential and reach only around 1.5% in the short term. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first interest rate rise since 2007 could be just round the corner, writes our economics correspondent Richard Partington: British consumers are being put on notice for a rate hike from next week, as official figures show the economy expanding faster than anticipated in the three months to September. GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017 following expansion of 0.3% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 0.3%. The official figures come as the Bank of England prepares to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, with the monetary policy committee likely to take them into account ahead of its decision on 2 November. Threadneedle Street has faced a slew of warnings against raising the cost of borrowing, amid growing concerns over the strength of the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could be allayed by the latest data. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the latest figures \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: You can keep up to speed on all the latest economic and business news with our daily email..... Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate looks \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubpar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, despite avoiding the recession that some experts predicted after the EU referendum. He adds: The third quarter has been particularly difficult for the UK economy, with inflation ringing 3% while wage growth has been subdued. Consumers are facing an increased squeeze in living standards while the city has been brought to its knees by the increased uncertainty over Brexit proceedings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has tweeted a nice graph showing how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate has slowed (to 1.5% in the last quarter). John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says the UK economy is too weak, and needs more government investment - ideally in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures further confirm the impact that seven wasted years of Tory economic policy has had on working households. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic growth for the majority of 2017 has been below what was expected. In recent weeks leading independent forecasters have slashed growth for next year, and the latest economic data shows wages are still set to fall behind prices - squeezing living standards further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK is not growing as fast as many of our trading partners in the EU or the USA, and it is becoming increasingly clear that this government has to use next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget for a change of direction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor cannot keep hiding from the facts, as his approach of carrying on as usual is seriously putting working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour has consistently called for increased investment underpinned by our fiscal credibility rule, so that we can prepare our economy for any downturn from the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chaotic handling of Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still suffering from the Brexit vote last year, and the slide in the value of the pound. He argues that the 0.4% growth recorded in the July-September quarter shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be celebrated. Dixon writes: UK GDP growth....was a little bit above what we had expected but still below the rates of growth we enjoyed back in 2016 as service sector growth appears to be running around one or two tenths slower. This in turn may be a consequence of the weakness of consumption, triggered by the recent inflation pickup which itself is a consequence of the Brexit-induced collapse in sterling. All in all, it appears that the economy is running around 0.5% per year more slowly than prior to the EU referendum. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Management School, agrees that the economic picture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rosy. Prof Milas: Brexit-related economic uncertainty is taking a toll on the economy not only in terms of getting stuck to 1.5% annual growth for 2017 Q3 but also in terms of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the reading itself. Indeed, since the Brexit vote, the first reading of ONS has over-estimated annual GDP growth by a notable average of 0.3%. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the UK economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstuck in second gear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding. Year-on-year growth stands at 1.5%, which if it continues would be the weakest expansion since the crisis. The productivity puzzle remains unsolved - GDP per head lagged the headline number and increased by just 0.3%. Yael Selfin, KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief UK economist, warns that the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t growing fast enough to justify tax cuts in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some detail of the UK GDP report, showing that computer programming and the UK car sector grew strongly over the summer. The strong performance by the motor industry is a surprise, as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest car dealer, Pendragon, issued a profit warning on Monday.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some really granular detail: The Treasury have released a comment from Chancellor Philip Hammond, although it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really address the GDP figures directly.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment. My focus now, and going into the Budget, is on boosting productivity so that we can deliver higher-wage jobs and a better standard of living for people across the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is why I am visiting the Francis Crick Institute, where they are using cutting-edge research to generate real-life health improvements. The UK has world-leading expertise in life sciences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it is through supporting growth in these cutting-edge industries that we will build a competitive economy that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several analysts are pointing out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate remains unimpressive, despite rising in the last quarter: Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says Britain is only achieving \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstable but slow growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline growth of 0.4% over the third quarter represents a slight increase over the second quarter figure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the year, growth is just 1.5%, and the quarterly figure suggests little momentum going forward. Sterling has risen on the back of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report, up 0.25% against the US dollar to $1.317. City traders are concluding that the pick-up in growth raises the chances of a UK interest rate rise next month. This pick-up in UK growth means that Britain still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered the recession that some experts predicted if the country voted to leave the EU. However, 0.4% is a still below the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term growth rate. As this chart shows, 2017 could be the weakest year for the economy since the financial crisis (the 2012 figures are distorted by the London Olympics). If you adjust for population changes, UK GDP rose by 0.3% during the last quarter. But....UK construction output shrank for the second quarter in a row, which means Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector is in recession. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter. It expanded by 0.4% in the July-September period. The ONS says services was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the largest contributor to GDP growth, with a strong performance in computer programming, motor trades and retail trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain manufacturing also returned to growth, with output rising by a punchy 1.0% during the quarter. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in the second quarter, and a little better than the City expected. More to follow! Just two minutes to go until we discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed over the summer.... The pound is down slightly against the US dollar this morning at $1.312, and also against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.115. It may move sharply in a few minutes, if the GDP figures are a surprise... Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report will influence whether UK interest rates rise this year (for the first time in a decade). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With expectations still rife that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures will be closely scrutinised to see whether they give any excuse for policymakers to hold fire or if they support their hawkish intent. Uncertainty about Brexit, the relatively fragile state of the British economy and fears over personal debt and household incomes could all be making Mr Carney think twice about whether now is the right time to start the process of raising rates. However, the prospect of delaying could lead to accusations of the MPC crying wolf again and severely dent sterling. Rocks and hard places abound, and the Governor will be keeping his fingers crossed that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure gives him a valid excuse either way. The Treasury have created a little video explaining how GDP works: While we wait for the UK growth report, do listen to Robert Kennedy explaining how GDP is an imperfect measure. Kennedy gave the speech to the University of Kansas in 1968, a few months before he was assassinated, saying: Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy outperformed the eurozone for several years, during the euro debt crisis. But as this chart show, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate caught up in 2016, and outpaced the UK so far this year. That has probably helped Britain avoid a sharper downturn this year. Good morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to discover how well Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing in the face of Brexit uncertainty, rising inflation and persistently weak productivity. The first estimate of UK GDP for the July to September period, due at 9.30am BST, will show how quickly, or slowly, the economy expanded in the last quarter. It may not be a great picture either; economists predict that GDP rose by just 0.3% during the quarter, significantly below the long-term trend growth. The annual growth rate could also drop to just 1.5% - again, rather weaker than in recent years. 2017 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly been a vintage year for the UK economy. GDP only rose by 0.3% in both the first and second quarter, partly due to a slowdown in the dominant service sector. Having been one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in recent years, Britain has actually been the slowest-growing G7 nation so far this year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcheck on the UK economy is particularly important, as chancellor Philip Hammond weighs up what tax and spending changes to make in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. It will also influence whether the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates at its monetary policy meeting next week. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at Royal Bank of Canada, fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate could fall to just 0.2%, as there are signs that the service sector actually shrank in July. He says: However, it is far from clear whether or not the preliminary estimate of Q3 GDP will reveal growth of 0.2% q/q or 0.3% q/q. Our long-standing forecast has been 0.2% q/q, which we will stick with following news of a contraction in the services sector in July. It is also highly probable that, even with a recovery in September, for the quarter as a whole the construction sector will end up being a drag on growth. Against those headwinds, industrial production has been on a much better footing in Q3, so the overall growth estimate will depend on the extent to which the services sector rebounded in August and September. City traders are bracing for some drama at 9.30am -- a weak GDP report could send the pound sliding. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at forex broker FXTM, explains: Overall, October is shaping up to be a painful trading month for Sterling, especially in light of deteriorating economic fundamentals and slow progress on Brexit talks weighing heavily on the currency. Inflation in the U.K. has jumped to a five-and-a-half year high at 3%, while wage growth remains subdued. With households feeling the squeeze as wage growth continues to fall behind inflation, concerns remain elevated over the sustainability of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer-driven economic growth.",

Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is still under negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Far from being a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ceiling of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1bn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would characterize last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amazon September results as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPicasso-like quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, as it shows America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the last quarter came from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rate hike is fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Kohl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad sales. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s durables release). Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet day...

Here we consider the arguments for raising them versus the reasons to hold steady.</p> <h2><strong>The case for higher rates</strong></h2> <p>The Bank of England was set two targets when it was reconstituted by Gordon Brown in the late 1990s and granted the power to set interest rates independently: to maintain inflation at around 2% and to make sure that monetary policy kept the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wheels turning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Keeping the economy expanding has won out over the imperative to maintain inflation steady at 2%</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the past 10 years these have proved to be conflicting aims, because to raise rates has been seen as an almost certain way to kill off growth. That wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the case in more normal times, but in the aftermath of the banking crash, with lenders initially strapped for funds and regulators concerned to keep the financial sector on a tight rein, low interest rates were seen as the only way to keep money flowing around the economy. And that is especially true when so much household spending is based on borrowed money.</p> <p>So the second concern \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to keep GDP expanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has won out over the imperative to maintain inflation steady at 2%, and inflation has been allowed to soar to 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it did in 2012, when the Bank sat firmly on its hands and did nothing.</p> <p>Forecasts for inflation don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show it going back to 2012 levels, but with a rate of 3% recorded in September and predictions of rises for at least the next couple of months, the Bank must consider increasing the cost of borrowing to reduce the demand for goods and services, and calm price rises.</p> <p>Further price increases could already be in the pipeline, according to some MPC members, following the fall in unemployment to 4.3% in the three months to August. As Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, says, the joblessness rate is at its lowest since 1975 and well below the 4.5% equilibrium rate the Bank believes determines full employment and is the trigger for higher wages. With more money in their pockets, workers could be tempted to borrow and spend even more, adding to the pressure on prices.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just jobs: the economy has held up much better than most forecasters, including the Bank, predicted following the Brexit vote. It has grown throughout the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when many thought it could fall into recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after three previous years of growth. If the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise rates against this backdrop, then when?</p> <p>Some economists also believe the bank should take the opportunity to raise rates now because it may need to cut them again the future. At 0.25%, the bank has no real leeway for a cut that would act as a stimulus.

As Archer says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it fails again to follow through with a rate hike, it will risk losing credibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>It would also probably prompt a fall in the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which would stoke inflation even further.</p> <p>Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation as a modern-day Grand Old Duke of York is under particular scrutiny.

He has voted for a rise ever since, arguing that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pick-up in inflation is not something we can just ignore\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, especially when the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153healthy performance of businesses in the past year shows the UK economy could cope with higher interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. How hawkish? 10 Andrew Haldane Chief economist Haldane was once a fervent supporter of low interest rates, but in the summer hinted that he was more inclined to start pushing them higher. In June, he said a partial withdrawal of the emergency post-Brexit package of an interest rate cut and an extra \u00c2\u00a360bn of quantitative easing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be prudent relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. How hawkish? 6 David Ramsden Deputy governor In charge of markets and banking, the former Treasury economist says slowing growth and declining real wages mean now is not the time for a rate rise. He said last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite continued robust growth in employment, there is no sign of second-round effects [demands for higher pay] on to wages from higher recent inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How hawkish? 2 Jon Cunliffe Deputy governor In charge of financial stability at the Bank, Cunliffe is one of the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most risk- averse members. Last month he told the Western Mail that the UK economy had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly slowed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that any rate rises would be gradual. As he put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The exact timing of when that starts? Well, that for me is a more open question.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How hawkish? 4 Ben Broadbent Deputy governor Responsible for monetary policy, Broadbent is a close confidant of Carney and keeps his cards close to his chest. In July he stressed the weakness of the economic outlook, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision [to raise rates]. I am not ready to do it yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How hawkish? 6 Mark Carney Governor Carney is expected to vote for a rise after saying in September that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153possibility has definitely increased\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To give a little more context to his decision, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The majority of committee members, myself included, see that that balancing act is beginning to shift, and that ... to return inflation to that 2% target in a sustainable manner, there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How hawkish? 6",

She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a country that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-property\">taxes British residents</a>, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">overheated housing market</a>. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police\">holds UK property in offshore companies</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/egregious-loophole-property-capital-gains-tax-close-foreign-owners-commercial\">This egregious tax loophole costs the UK \u00c2\u00a38bn every year.

We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing.</li> </ul> <p>Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing<br></p> <ul> <li>The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly.</li> <li>Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment.</li> <li>The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc.</li> <li>We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018.</li> </ul> <p>Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill.</li> <li>We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers.</li> </ul> <p>Machinery Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly.</li> </ul> <p>Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry.</li> </ul> <p>Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits.</li> </ul> <p>Printing and Related Support Activities </p> <ul> <li>The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode.</li> <li>We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year.

This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income.</p> <p>Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding).

                "bodyText":"In an uncertain day ahead of a busy week, the Spanish stock market bucked the trend and jumped sharply on hopes that the Catalan independence crisis could be resolved. A positive set of GDP numbers for the country also helped sentiment. Elswhere the FTSE 100 slipped lower, as its overseas earners reacted badly to a stronger pound, which moved higher ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting where the first interest rise in a decade is widely expected. On Wall Street the latest developments in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election saw markets slip back. There was also talk that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long awaited tax reforms may only be gradual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00c2\u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmonth/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153head for the exits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial price declines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primary driver of inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally, a chart showing why \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash for clunkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery weak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit by \u00c2\u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent growth figures this morning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00c2\u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00c2\u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00c2\u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpreadsheet Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 and 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchypothecated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given all the current pressures and uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the policy action that these might require \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasingly intense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very tricky hand indeed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. The \u00c2\u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00c2\u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00c2\u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00c2\u00a370 billion) in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00c2\u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit is on track to still be \u00c2\u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as much as the \u00c2\u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwriggle room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",

While the economic consequences of these developments have yet to emerge, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic data were positive. In third-quarter 2017, GDP growth remained robust at 0.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest level since 2008.

                "bodyText":"Positive eurozone economic data in the form of strong third quarter growth figures and falling unemployment meant a fairly positive end to the month for European equities. Most markets managed to close higher, although Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was closed for a public holiday. In the US, investors were more focused on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting than upbeat consumer confidence figures, but Wall Street still managed to make slight gains after an uncertain start. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.27 points or 0.07% at 7493.08 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.18% better at 5503.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was up 0.18% at 22,793.69 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.74% better at 10,523.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.12% to 759.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 17 points or 0.08%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The continuing dispute between Spain and Catalan separatists should have no immediate effect on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign debt ratings, says S&amp;P Global. The agency said that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly application of Article 155 [removing Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional government from office] and the frontloading of regional elections have reduced the likelihood of a short-term escalation of tensions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said it did not believe Catalan independence would take place: As we expected, no national government has recognized Catalonia as an independent state. The most prominent credit risk we continue to see is that the related tensions could lead to a sustained drop in business and consumer confidence and potential business disruption from fourth-quarter 2017 onward, especially in Catalonia. While the economic consequences of these developments have yet to emerge, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic data were positive. In third-quarter 2017, GDP growth remained robust at 0.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest level since 2008. This confirms our expectation of Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong economic performance. US markets are more focused on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting than the positive data we have seen today. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite a very good afternoon for data the Dow Jones and dollar were reticent to do much this Tuesday, investors holding back ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed statement. The CB consumer confidence reading smashed expectations, coming in at 125.9 against the 121.1 forecast and the 120.6 seen in September (itself revised higher from the initial estimate). The Chicago PMI was also pretty muscular; at 66.2 it hit its best level in around 3 years. Yet off the back of these numbers the Dow Jones could only rise 0.1%, while the greenback actually fell 0.3% against the pound. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely because investors are a bit nervy ahead of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting. While a December hike seems pretty much locked on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the CME Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FedWatch tool pointing to a 98.2% chance of a rate rise in the festive month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the market will still be looking for a firmly hawkish statement from Janet Yellen on Wednesday. Elsewhere the FTSE saw its daily gains shrink to just 0.1% as the afternoon wore on, leaving the index once again the wrong side of 7500. Sterling, on the other hand, stretched its legs against the euro, doubling its growth to 0.4%, while cable climbed back above $1.325, as investors continue to focus on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE rate vote. Over in Greece, and there is some good news for the country from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone jobs figures. Helena Smith reports: Greek unemployment dropped to 21 % in July [the latest data available] according to the European statistics agency (Eurostat), with the number of jobless Greeks at 1.01m. Of that number 17.5 % were men and 25.3 percent women, it said. At the height of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis four years ago, unemployment nudged 28 % spurring a massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of qualified Greek abroad. The jobless rate among those under the age of 25 also dropped from 43% in June to 42.8%. Meanwhile, well-placed finance ministry officials say the government is also planning a second foray into the bond market possibly as early as next month, before Greece completes a third bailout review with the international bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. News of the prospective foray, in effect a second test run, would prepare Athens for exit from its current bailout programme which expires in less than a year. Greece successfully put its toe back into bond market for the first time since 2014 in July but analysts insist that real economic recovery will only come when its staggering debt pile is ultimately tackled.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report from Rob Davies: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob on BBC Radio Scotland talking about the issue (from about 49.45). US investors seem to be playing its safe ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite further upbeat trading statements from the likes of Kellogg and Mastercard, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down 0.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite has slipped 0.01%. European markets are generally flat too, although Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up another 0.5% as fears over the Catalan independence threat continue to recede. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax meanwhile is closed for a holiday. On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased to its highest level in almost 17 years (Dec. 2000, 128.6) in October after remaining relatively flat in September. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions improved, boosted by the job market which had not received such favorable ratings since the summer of 2001. Consumers were also considerably more upbeat about the short-term outlook, with the prospect of improving business conditions as the primary driver. Confidence remains high among consumers, and their expectations suggest the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace for the remainder of the year. These positive US figures come as the Federal Reserve holds its latest monetary policy meeting, and while no rise in interest rates is expected this month, all the signs point to an increase in December. (By then we should also know the name of the next Fed chair, with Donald Trump set to announce his appointee sometime this week.) Over in the US, and consumers were more confident than expected in October. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index came in at 125.9, better than the 121 figure forecast by analysts. It was also higher than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 120.6, itself revised upwards from 119.8, and the best level since December 2000. Earlier there were also positive manufacturing figures from Chicago. The purchasing managers index rose from 65.2 in September to 66.2, better than the expected fall to 61. Right, time for a quick recap.... The Eurozone is on track to grow faster than America and the UK this year, after reporting better-than-expected growth figures over the last quarter. Eurozone GDP grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, faster than expected and beating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% growth. On an annual basis, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5% during the last quarter - which is its fastest rate since the first three months of 2011. Economists say the recovery seems to be strengthening. In another boost, the eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.9%, as the expanding economy helped people to find work. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, says British businesses should look for growth opportunities in the euro area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is easy for businesses to fall into the trap of over-cautiousness when the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own growth rate is slower, but capitalising on Eurozone successes now will help companies to secure their future. Businesses can and should be doing as much as they can to drive up productivity and activity through positive investment in both people and assets, taking advantage of positive economic conditions to help them navigate successfully through times of uncertainty, and emerge in a position of strength.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The day began with solid growth figures from France, which grew by 0.5% during the last quarter. Like the wider eurozone, France racked up its best annual growth since the early days of the euro debt crisis (when Greece was being bailed out and the Italian government was faltering). It grew by 2.2% compared with Q3 2016, while the UK only grew by 1.5% over the same time. Experts say France moved into a higher gear. Domestic demand drove the growth, with household spending and business investment both up. Austria also had a decent summer, expanding by 0.8%. Canada, though, seems to be slowing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDO shrank by 0.1% in August, after stagnating in July. Hello..... sterling is suddenly pushing higher against the euro. The pound has gained almost 0.5% against the single currency to a one-month high of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. This follows reports that the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, ha said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to speed up negotiations with the UK. Newsflash: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy unexpectedly contracted, a little, in August. Canadian GDP shrank by 0.1% in August, due to a decline in mining and manufacturing output. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good-producing sector shrank by 0.7% during August, wiping out a 0.1% rise in service sector output. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.1% in August, having been flat in July as the strong growth recorded earlier this year has faded. Unless something remarkable happened in September, Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 growth rate is going to struggle to match other advanced economies. That has hurt the Canadian dollar, which is now falling against the US dollar. High street retailer John Lewis has fuelled worries about UK consumer spending, by posting its fifth weekly fall in sales in a row. Takings at John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores fell by 4.0% year-on-year in the seven days to Saturday 28th October. That includes a 1.9% drop in fashion sales, and a 7% slump in sales of electronics and home technology. Last week, the CBI warned that retailers were reporting the biggest drop in demand since the recession.... Not only is the eurozone enjoying faster growth than Britain, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also experiencing less inflation. The consumer prices index, which tracks the cost of living, rose by just 1.4% per annum this month, according to new data released this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 1.5% in September. In contrast, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate hit 3% in September, and the Bank of England expects it kept rising in October. So with inflation down, unemployment down and growth up, the eurozone does look rather healthier than a few years ago: It may be Halloween, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing scary in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone growth figures, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index: Eurozone growth is pretty broad-based right now, adding weight to the argument that the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is well entrenched. Spain, for all of its political woes related to Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for independence, posted a 3.1% GDP rate for Q3, while France saw growth beat expectations and reach 2.2% for last quarter. We are still waiting to hear about growth rates in other major nations such as Germany and Italy, if they can post rates around this level then the mood music in Brussels is likely to be good. The eurozone economy is benefitting from strong domestic demand, thanks to record low interest rates, says Raj Badiani, director at IHS Markit: Households are experiencing a more supportive climate, characterized by still-cheap credit, while lower-than-expected inflation rates have limited the anticipated squeeze on household purchasing power during second and third quarters. Additionally, still-rising employment and a retreating unemployment rate have lifted both household confidence and spending across the region in the first three quarters of 2017. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve plotted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth figures alongside the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own GDP figures, to show how Europe powered ahead this year. The long-awaited fall in eurozone unemployment is helping to drive growth this year, says Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ulster Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists say the eurozone recovery is stronger than expected: Ben Chu of the Independent shows how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate overtook the UK a year ago: Philip Shaw of Investec thinks the eurozone could outpace America this year, as well as the UK. (last week we learned that US GDP grew by 2.3% over the last 12 months, so a little slower than the eurozone). The eurozone has just posted its fastest annual growth rate since the beginning of the debt crisis, partly due to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance. That means the eurozone has outpaced Britain this year, as UK GDP only expanded by 1.5% over the last 12 months (as explained at 7.32am). Breaking! The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stronger reading than expected. In another boost, growth in the second quarter has been revised up to 0.7%, from 0.6%. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 2.5% -- a healthy rate, which underlines that the European economy has enjoyed quite a sparkling 2017. The latest unemployment figures also show an improvement -- the euro area jobless rate has dropped to 8.9% for September, the lowest since the start of 2009. Newsflash: Fashion chain Burberry have just announced that its chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, is leaving. Thats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only three months since Bailey relinquished the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair to Marco Gobbetti, a move that was meant to allow Bailey to focus on creative matters. Bailey has received wide acclaim over the years for transforming Burberry into a global fashion house, so this could be a blow to the company. As chairman Sir John Peace puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christopher is a unique talent and an exceptional person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who has worked as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great partner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the firm. Shareholders may be concerned. Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 2% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard..... In other news, the UK government has outlined its plans to protect gamblers from fixed-odds betting terminals. Under the plan, the maximum bet could be cut from \u00c2\u00a3100 to just \u00c2\u00a32 (or possibly to \u00c2\u00a350, which seems rather less radical).... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart, which suggests France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has shifted into a higher gear: Barclays economics team agree, saying: We think the French economy is poised to grow solidly next year, projecting 1.9% (consensus: 1.7%), with investment likely to provide increasing support to private consumption, the main growth engine. Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global chief investment strategist, is concerned that the UK is lagging behind other advanced economies such as France. He believes Brexit uncertainty is weighing the economy down, meaning Britain faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctough slog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Turnill says: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muted growth outlook stands in stark contrast to 2016, when the UK sat close to the top of G7 growth charts alongside Germany. Brexit negotiations in particular are weighing on the UK economy. Significant progress on three key issues is needed for discussions to move on to the post-Brexit trade relationship between the UK and European Union (EU): the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial obligations to the EU, and the Irish border. Progress has been made in recent weeks on these issues, but not enough to advance talks, the EU leaders concluded at their recent summit. Reuters have a good first take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French growth figures, for anyone just tuning in: The French economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous three months as consumer spending picked up and investment remained robust, the INSEE national statistics agency said on Tuesday in a first estimate. The result, which was spot in line with a Reuters poll of 27 analysts, meant gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 2.2% over a year, the fastest pace of growth since 2011. Upward revisions in the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year - both by 0.1 percentage point to 0.6% - gave a growth carry-over of 1.7%, the performance for 2017 if growth was zero in the final quarter. Following the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over the first nine months, President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government should have little trouble surpassing the 1.7% growth forecast it built its budget plans on. Barclays have also hailed France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth performance: Newsflash: Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of this year. That matches the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the second quarter, and is a pretty decent result. It means Austria is growing as fast as Spain (and rather faster than both France and the UK). WIFO, the think tank which compiled the report, says the recovery is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad-based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with foreign trade and domestic demand both growing. On an annual basis, Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is motoring along nicely with 2.6% growth. Holder Sandte, economist at Nordea Markets, believes France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic economy strengthened over the summer: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is fresh confirmation that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has outperformed the UK this year French GDP grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017, then 0.6% in Q2, and then 0.5% in Q3. In contrast, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only expanded by 0.3% in the first and second quarters of this year, rising to 0.4% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate, at 2.2%, is so much better than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.5%. INSEE says that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate, of 2.2%, is the strongest since 2011 -- when the eurozone debt crisis was exploding. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Deen is impressed by France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over the last year: Economist Fred Ducrozet, of Swiss bank Pictet, agrees that the recovery is on track: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics reckons that Paris is now going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoe to toe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Berlin in the growth stakes: (reminder, we get German GDP on 14th November) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that French household spending accelerated in the last three months, from 0.3% to 0.5%. Businesses also kept spending on new machinery and equipment; \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rose by 0.8% during the quarter. Inventory changes also boosted growth,as firms stocked up on new raw materials and components. But, foreign trade was a drag on growth. Imports accelerated sharply (+2.5% after +0.2%) while exports decelerated significantly (+0.7% after +2.3%). INSEE says that France imported more transport equipment during the quarter, but sold fewer manufacturing goods abroad. BREAKING: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fifth quarter of growth in a row, as the French recovery continues to gather pace. Consumer spending and business investment drove French growth during the quarter, says statistics body INSEE. In another boost for president Emmanuel Macron, the growth rate in the second quarter of 2017 has been revised up to 0.6%, from 0.5%. The French economy has grown by 2.2% over the last 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest annual growth rate since 2011, I think.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also rather stronger than the UK, which only grew by 1.5% over the last 12 months (and 0.4% in the third quarter). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull details and reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European politicians and top officials will be hoping to avoid any Halloween shocks today, as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy comes under the microscope. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone GDP day, when we find out how fast Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continued in the third quarter of 2017. Economists predict that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth rate dipped to 0.5% in Q3, from the almost-boisterous 0.6% recorded in April-June. If so, that would beat the UK, which grew by 0.4% in the same period. As well as the headline eurozone growth figure, at 10am GMT, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting data from France and Austria. Alas, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until next month for other heavyweights like Germany and Italy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen some signs that Europe did well in the third quarter - yesterday, Spain posted 0.8% growth in the last three months. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all.... we also get new eurozone inflation and unemployment figures this morning. This splurge of data should give us a good picture of how the economy is faring. Later today, Canada also posts growth figures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also going to be a busy morning for airline news, with budget operator Ryanair and manufacturer Airbus both reporting results. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are expected to open fairly flat, as traders watch for political drama in America following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictments of three of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former aides: October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good month for shares, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Despite the fallout from a new series of political surprises across Europe, the Teflon rally that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen since the beginning of the year shows no signs of slowing down apart from the occasional pause, with markets across Europe set to post significant gains in another good month for stocks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for the third quarter of 2017 8am GMT: Austrian GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone flash inflation rate for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for September 12.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP for August",
