Cable fell 0.2%, taking sterling below $1.327 for the first time in almost 3 weeks.

Analysts are expecting the figure to nudge higher, from 53.2 in August to 53.3 in September; however, as we have seen twice already this week, those estimates have a tendency to be off the mark.

Real GDP initially reacts positively to increases in household debt, as do consumption, employment, and house and bank equity prices.</p> <p>However, after one or two years, the dynamic relationship between debt, GDP, consumption, employment, housing, and bank equity prices turns negative. Higher household debt is associated with a greater probability of a banking crisis, especially when debt is already high, and with greater risk of declines in bank equity prices.</p> </blockquote> <p>The warning comes in the analytical chapters of the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Financial Stability Report, which have just been published.</p> <p>In an accompanying blog post, senior IMF Nico Valckx spells out that increasing the ratio of household debt actually leads to <strong>lower</strong> growth, over say five years.

But too much grease ends up bunging the wheels of growth, he explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> At first, households take on more debt to buy things like new homes and cars. That gives the economy a short-term boost as automakers and home builders hire more workers. But later, highly indebted households may need to cut back on spending to repay their loans. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drag on growth.</p> <p> And as the 2008 crisis demonstrated, a sudden economic shock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a decline in home prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can trigger a spiral of credit defaults that shakes the foundations of the financial system.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/915202490123132929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IMF warns that using consumer debt to fuel growth risks crisis <a href=\"https://t.co/mAd3HcfMuu\">https://t.co/mAd3HcfMuu</a></p>&mdash; The Guardian (@guardian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/915202490123132929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T13:50:53.467Z\">at 2.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59d38abee4b0563a9b0f8e39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T13:08:14.108Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>UK readers will be well aware that the cost of living in Britain has risen sharply in the last year, following the slump in the pound after the EU referendum.</strong></p> <p>Now, a new report has highlighted that inflation in the UK is outpacing other advanced nations, including Germany, the US and France.</p> <p>My colleague Richard Partington explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has the highest inflation rate among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economies, in the latest sign the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote is contributing to a squeeze on living standards.</p> <p>The increased cost of importing food and fuel is pushing prices to rise at a faster rate than anywhere in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> group of leading global economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street hitting new highs and Spanish shares recovering from their falls following the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violence at the Catalan independence vote, European markets managed to gain some ground, albeit a limited amount. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.27 points or 0.39% at 7468.11, helped by a weaker pound in the wake of disappointing construction figures France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.32% at 5367.41 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was closed for the Unity day holiday Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.02% at 10,257.5 But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB slipped 0.12% to 22,784.82 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.8% to 752.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 69 points or 0.31%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Some breaking UK news, and the Royal Mail is facing a strike threat, its first since it was privatised. Workers voted emphatically in favour of industrial action over pensions, pay and jobs. The Press Association reports: Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed walkouts by 89% on a turnout of 73% of the 110,000 balloted. It passed the threshold in the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial Trade Union Act, under which ballots need a 50% turnout for industrial action to go ahead. The CWU believes it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153watershed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment for unions as well as the Royal Mail, which it has accused of following a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relentless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd programme of cost-cutting to maximise short-term profits and shareholder returns. The union accused the company of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unilaterally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd closing its defined benefit, or final salary, pension scheme, with new entrants going into an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inferior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scheme which will leave them in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pensioner poverty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The union is also in dispute over pay and issues such as delivery office closures... The CWU Postal Executive will meet later this week to determine the next steps in this campaign and any potential strike dates. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, is also contemplating a weaker pound: The Dow has punched to new all-time highs today, as the optimism sparked by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump tax plans continue to drive outperformance in US markets. On a day devoid of any major economic data points from the eurozone and US, the focus has been on the UK in the wake of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI which plummeted into contraction territory. With London house prices shrinking, and business confidence suffering, it comes as no surprise that completed construction jobs are failing to be replaced with new orders as investment dries up. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI should give us a good idea of how the fourth quarter could shape up, and if the manufacturing and construction readings are anything to go by, we are likely to see further deterioration in both economic data, and in turn, the pound. As Wall Street hits new highs, the UK market is edging higher, mainly due to weakness in the pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says sterling weakness could continue: Despite having little to push it higher beyond its own momentum, a 50 point rise saw the Dow cross 22600 for the first time in its history. The FTSE, on the other hand, was at a rather less impressive on month high, climbing past 7450 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a repeated ceiling for the index in the past couple of months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks to a sterling-inspired 0.4% increase. Talking of the pound, its miserable, manufacturing and construction PMI-dampened start to October continued this Tuesday. Cable fell 0.2%, taking sterling below $1.327 for the first time in almost 3 weeks. Against the euro the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses were even greater, the pound dropping 0.4% to a 2 week, sub \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.127 nadir after the European Parliament claimed that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsufficient progress has not yet been made\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the EU divorce bill, preventing progress to the next round of negotiations. Whether or not the pound can find a tourniquet for its losses may be dependent on Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to nudge higher, from 53.2 in August to 53.3 in September; however, as we have seen twice already this week, those estimates have a tendency to be off the mark. If the services sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the main fuel for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shows the same signs of slowdown as the manufacturing and construction PMIs, then the pound may be in line for another pummelling. Some disappointing data from the US. The Institute for Supply Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current business conditions index for New York fell to 49.7 in September, down from 56.6 in August. A reading below 50 signals contraction. And if you think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153record US stock market highs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd many times before in the past few months, well, you have: DING DING! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading in New York. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also highlights how Canada has gone on a household debt spree since the financial crisis, while American families have managed to cut their borrowing burden. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has posted sparkling growth earlier this year, while house prices have also soared. If the IMF are right, there could be a reckoning at some stage.... The IMF also warns that the least wealthy are being dragged deeper into debt, and will suffer the most if there is an economic crisis. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report says: Lower-income groups tend to be more vulnerable. Household surveys confirm that, within countries, the share of lower-income households in total debt has grown. These households typically have higher debt-to-income, higher debt-service-to-income, and higher debt-to-assets ratios, which makes them more vulnerable to adverse shocks than higher-income households. This chart shows how a build-up of household debt can create a vicious circle: As you can see....once banks cut back on lending, asset prices fall, households default on their debt, hitting bank capital reserves, leading them to cut back on their lending etc etc. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the rise in consumer debt risks destabilising the global economy. In a new report, the IMF flags up that increased borrowing can stimulate short-term growth, but it also creates financial instability. The Fund says: On average, an increase in household debt boosts growth in the short term but may give rise to macroeconomic and financial stability risks in the medium term. Real GDP initially reacts positively to increases in household debt, as do consumption, employment, and house and bank equity prices. However, after one or two years, the dynamic relationship between debt, GDP, consumption, employment, housing, and bank equity prices turns negative. Higher household debt is associated with a greater probability of a banking crisis, especially when debt is already high, and with greater risk of declines in bank equity prices. The warning comes in the analytical chapters of the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Financial Stability Report, which have just been published. In an accompanying blog post, senior IMF Nico Valckx spells out that increasing the ratio of household debt actually leads to lower growth, over say five years. The effect is particularly stark for advanced economies, as this chart shows: Valckz says that debt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greases the wheels of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, letting people make an important big purchase and finance it over time. But too much grease ends up bunging the wheels of growth, he explains: At first, households take on more debt to buy things like new homes and cars. That gives the economy a short-term boost as automakers and home builders hire more workers. But later, highly indebted households may need to cut back on spending to repay their loans. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drag on growth. And as the 2008 crisis demonstrated, a sudden economic shock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a decline in home prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can trigger a spiral of credit defaults that shakes the foundations of the financial system. More here: UK readers will be well aware that the cost of living in Britain has risen sharply in the last year, following the slump in the pound after the EU referendum. Now, a new report has highlighted that inflation in the UK is outpacing other advanced nations, including Germany, the US and France. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The UK has the highest inflation rate among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economies, in the latest sign the Brexit vote is contributing to a squeeze on living standards. The increased cost of importing food and fuel is pushing prices to rise at a faster rate than anywhere in the G7 group of leading global economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The UK is only behind Turkey, Mexico and the eastern European states of Latvia and Estonia in the club of 35 developed nations. The annual growth in prices in the UK jumped to 2.9% in August from 2.6% in July, equalling a four-year high in the consumer price index (CPI) reached in May earlier this year. That outstrips the average 2.2% growth in prices across the OECD for the same month. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction woes haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dampened the mood in the financial markets. World stock markets remain at record highs today, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a one-month high, up 9 points at 7448. Big exporters are benefitting from the drop in the pound this morning. Hundreds of workers in Norwich face an uncertain future after drinks company Britvic announced plans to shut its factory in the city. The group is planning to move production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot drinks from the Norwich factory to sites in east London, Leeds and Rugby by 2019. The 242 people who work there will be offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153redeployment opportunities at other sites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Britvic, or support to find a new job elsewhere. The site is co-owned with consumer goods giant Unilever, which makes Coleman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mustard there. Unilever says it is now reviewing its own options; that could mean that production of the fiery condiment ends after two hundred years. Local MPs and business leaders are rallying around, according to the local Eastern Daily Press. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Clive Lewis tweets: Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is very sad news and many constituents will be very anxious about this possible closure. At this stage, I am urging the company to make every support available to those workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Montague, chief executive of London housing association L&amp;Q, is urging the government to help British construction and provide some Brexit certainty. He fears that building firms will struggle badly if they lose access to workers from overseas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures are worrying for the construction sector and at a time when more housebuilding is needed than ever before. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need assurance that an appropriate immigration policy will keep the doors open to skilled overseas talent and that there will suitable investment in training at home. Without this, the figures we are seeing today - will undoubtedly worsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153L&amp;Q and many others in the sector have skilled workforces, strong partnerships, access to land and the financial strength to deliver very ambitious plans. What we need now is political and economic certainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only people worrying about Brexit. The Bank of England has flagged up another concern this morning; that UK businesses could struggle to borrow after Britain leaves the EU. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because European banks who currently operate branches in Britain may have to upgrade to fully fledged subsidiaries after Brexit. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, they might not be allowed to operate. That would cut the amount of lending offer, the BoE fears. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: Companies from European Economic Area countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provide about 10% of lending to UK businesses and would need to reapply for authorisation to operate in Britain after it leaves the EU. In its latest update on potential risks to financial stability, the Bank of England said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of disruption to wholesale UK banking services appeared to be slightly higher than previously thought, given that a number of EEA firms branching into the UK were not sufficiently focused on addressing this issue. More here: Richard Threlfall, head of infrastructure, building and construction at KPMG has a very gloomy take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This reading is significantly worse than expected and shows that economic uncertainty continues to have a serious impact on the construction industry. Construction is an economic bellwether, so the concern will spread well beyond the sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a clear downturn in commercial construction, which is likely to continue. This is because new orders are dropping off, hitting pipelines. Infrastructure output also appears to be in decline and contractors will be concerned about a lack of new projects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one relative bright spot in the data was housebuilding, but even this lost momentum and there are fears that demand will drop off if interest rates rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar in over two weeks, down 0.2% at $1.325. Sterling has also shed 0.3% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.128. The fall in UK construction activity last month has come as a nasty shock to the City. Traders are concerned that the British economy may be weakening, in the face of Brexit worries and tensions at the heart of the UK government. Earlier today, a senior German MEP actually urged Theresa May to sack foreign secretary Boris Johnson following his comments about Brexit. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says this political tension is not good for sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today UK construction sector survey data fell into negative territory for the first time in more than a year. The data comes at a terrible time considering how poorly the latest rounds of macro data have performed, and also now that a potential political crisis is brewing in the Tory party. A combination of last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downward revisions of GDP data, the increase in trade deficit and consumer debt, coupled with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor manufacturing survey data are now followed by construction pessimism across the board. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report also shows that British builders are suffering from the weak pound. Input cost inflation hit a seven-month high in September, meaning construction firms were forced to pay more for raw materials. Jason Robinson of trade credit insurer Euler Hermes fears that British building companies could suffer a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domino effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of failures in the months ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Access to skilled labour is among the chief concerns within the construction industry. Without clarity on Brexit negotiations and in particularly EU workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights, uncertainty will weigh on contractors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pipelines because of the lack of concrete details over the future economic landscape. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the performance of housebuilders has been positive in 2017, an increase in failures across construction appears unavoidable as contracts become more difficult to get over the line and tendering becomes keener. High profile profit warnings continue as legacy contracts take their toll on margins.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Payment delays from large contractors could have a significant impact down the supply chain, and firms will need to be vigilant to avoid being caught in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdomino effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of failures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the government could help the building sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In infrastructure, contractors are hoping for further positive news in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget following this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of more funding for the north of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rail network. Despite uncertainty, the UK is still on the whole viewed by overseas funders as a good place in which to invest their capital. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, agrees that Brexit is hurting builders: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This contraction in the construction sector wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t welcomed by the market, and certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be welcomed by the Brexit negotiating team and those at the Conservative Party conference. Brexit uncertainty has returned to the fore and is back to weighing down on sterling, as a weak pound increases the cost of imported materials. The fall in commercial construction activity last month suggests companies are stopping investing in new shops, offices and factories. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying sign for economic growth, says Chris Williamson of Markit. The tumble in the UK construction PMI last month shows that anxiety over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hitting the economy. So argues Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Brock said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A dismal picture of construction emerged this month as the sector showed signs of worsening business conditions across the board. With the biggest contraction in overall activity since July 2016, and a drop in new orders, optimism was in short supply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Respondents pointed to obstructive economic conditions and the Brexit blight of uncertainty, freezing clients into indecision over new projects. Even housing, the stalwart of the construction sector stuttered with a dwindling performance, but civil engineering was the biggest victim falling to its weakest level for four and a half years. UK housebuilding growth slowed to a six-month low, while civil engineering and construction both shrank in September. Tim Moore of Markit, who produced today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, explains why activity hit a 14-month low of 48.1 last month: Commercial development has been the worst performing category in recent months. Construction firms attributed falling volumes of commercial work to subdued business investment and reduced risk appetite among clients, linked to heightened economic and political uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Civil engineering work decreased at its fastest pace since April 2013, which prompted concerns from survey respondents about a near-term lack of new infrastructure projects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House building slipped down a gear in September, which highlighted that fragile confidence has spread across all three key market segments. Some firms suggested that the loss of momentum for residential construction reflected worries about the outlook for ultra-low mortgage rates and less upbeat demand expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector is contracting, fuelling fears that the UK economy is slowing. The Markit construction PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, fell to just 48.1 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 51.1 in August. Crucially, it is below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In other words, activity across the building sector is shrinking, for the first time in 13 months (just after the Brexit vote). This is much worse than anyone in the City expected (economists predicted a reading of around 50.0) Builders interviewed by Markit say they suffered a drop in workloads due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fragile confidence and subdued risk appetite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among clients, especially in the commercial building sector. Brexit uncertainty appears to be a big factor. Markit says: Survey respondents widely commented on a headwind from political and economic uncertainty, alongside extended lead times for budget approvals among clients More to follow.... Greggs is hoping that a new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall day breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wrap, and a Thai chicken soup offering, will lure customers into its shops this autumn. The bakers chain reports that its breakfast sales have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grown strongly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the last three months, helping total takings to rise by 8.6%. Gregs is also cracking on with its expansion programme; planning to open up to 150 stores this year, and close 50. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already opened 98 since the start of January. Shares have risen by 1% so far today. Shares are nudging higher in Europe, with the Stoxx 600 index up 0.1%. Spanish shares are also up slightly, following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff after the Catalan referendum. In London, the FTSE 100 is flat. Ferguson is leading the risers, though, up 3.6% after announcing a \u00c2\u00a3500m share buyback alongside a sharp rise in profits. Ferguson (previously called Wolseley) has been benefitting from a tighter focus on the US housing market. World stock markets have hit a new peak, following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally on Wall Street. The MSCI All-Country World Share Index has nudged 488.33 points, indicating that equities have never been more expensive. This rally was led by America, where the New York stock market hit fresh record highs last night. The Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices all began October with new gains. Investors were cheered by the news that US factory growth hit a 13-year high last month, indicating that the US economy is expanding at a solid pace. Investors are also clinging to optimism that Donald Trump might push some growth-friendly measures though, as Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, explained (via CNBC): The economy is doing well despite the storms. A lot of folks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there will be tax reform but the market thinks there will be. If that happens, it will be a big boost to the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be taking the health of the UK building sector this morning, when Markit releases its latest Construction PMI report, for September. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t having a great time right now, with Brexit uncertainty deterring some clients from committing to new projects. In August, the construction PMI fell to a one-year low of 51.1 (50 = stagnation). And there are fears that growth hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picked up yet. The City consensus is that September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI dipped, to 51.0. Anything lower than that would indicate that builders are struggling. That would be a concern, after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI showed a factory slowdown. Royal Bank of Canada expect a weak construction report.... Our expectation is for a dip to 50.3 from 51.1 which would come on the back of an undershoot of expectations in the manufacturing PMI yesterday. However, what really matters is tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI as that will give us more of a sense of where the risks lie with our 0.2% q/q growth forecast for Q3. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be tracking the latest development around Monarch Airlines, following its collapse yesterday. Uber could also be in the news; its chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has flown to London for talks with the transport authority over the loss of its licence in the capital. Plus, we have results from baking firm Greggs (which has posted a 5% rise in like-for-like sales this summer), and heating supply firm Ferguson (whose profits are up 25% over the last year).

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US economy looks in great shape based on recent surveys, supporting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message that everyone needs to prepare for a higher interest rate environment.</p> <p>If you though Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM manufacturing index was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highest reading for 13 years, the non-manufacturing ISM index is astonishing. It has jumped from 55.3 to 59.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest reading in 12 years.</p> <p>Admittedly this jump is partly down to a rebound from the recent hurricanes but the strength clearly evident in the details of the report underlines the point that the US corporate sector is in great shape. A strong domestic economy is driving output and new orders while a fairly soft dollar and strong global demand are boosting exports.</p> <p>The non-manufacturing survey shows business activity jumping five points while new orders jumped six points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index has only been higher on two occasions in the past twelve years. Employment is also looking very strong at 56.8 versus the 50 break even level, which gives us confidence to assert that any softness in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls report relating to hurricane effects will be swiftly reversed in coming months.</p> <p>As such today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report reinforces our view that the only thing stopping a December hike is the potential for debt ceiling issues coming to a head, risking a government shutdown around year-end. Inflation wise, the price paid component indicates that the decline in inflation rates seen through this year will soon come to an end and the Fed is right to assert that disinflation was merely transitory.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d4f3bce4b076f91939b59c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-04T14:44:41.926Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on what the latest ISM surveys - manufacturing and non-manufacturing - say about the strength of the US economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeoffHall/status/915584702337175553\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With a PMI of 60.8 and an NMI of 59.8, the synthesized total-economy ISM index was 59.78 in Sep, fourth highest in survey&#39;s 20-year history. <a href=\"https://t.co/m5lWOc61tv\">pic.twitter.com/m5lWOc61tv</a></p>&mdash; Jeoff Hall (@JeoffHall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeoffHall/status/915584702337175553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d4f138e4b0c8da8831b992\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-04T14:35:31.099Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks fall by more than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude inventories dropped sharply last week, and by significantly more than expected.</p> <p>They fell by 6.02m barrels to 464.96m, compared with expectations of a 0.8m decline.

Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged to a new peak but France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac slipped back, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex dropped sharply in the wake of the Catalan crisis confronting the country following the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.53 points or 0.01% at 7467.58 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.53% to 12,970.52 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.08% lower at 5363.23 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.44% to 22,456.38 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 2.85% at 9964.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.23% to 750.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 32 points or 0.14%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 look at the global economic picture as evidenced by recent surveys: In the markets, the standout performance came from Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex, and not in a good way. Following the weekend violence surrounding the Catalan independence referendum, there is little sign of a resolution to the dispute between the region and the central government. So the Ibex has ended down almost 3%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus has been relentlessly on the situation in Spain, where Catalonia is seemingly headed for a declaration of independence. As a result, the Ibex remains under heavy pressure, with the index now down 11% from its highs. Geopolitical risk is back on the agenda, with investors shunning Spanish stocks in favour of their German counterparts, as the Dax returns to all-time high. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Ibex 35 has fallen to a mark not seen since March as the uncertainty surrounding Catalan independence is eroding investor confidence. The head of the Catalan separatist movement has pledged to declare independence for the region within days. The Spanish King and Prime Minister oppose this, and the region has been threatened with direct rule. The eyes of the world are on Catalonia and the spike in political tensions is likely to keep investors away. US interest rates are likely to rise in December given the strength of recent data, says ING Bank chief international economist James Knightley, barring a failure to resolve the debt ceiling problems. He said: The US economy looks in great shape based on recent surveys, supporting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message that everyone needs to prepare for a higher interest rate environment. If you though Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM manufacturing index was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highest reading for 13 years, the non-manufacturing ISM index is astonishing. It has jumped from 55.3 to 59.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest reading in 12 years. Admittedly this jump is partly down to a rebound from the recent hurricanes but the strength clearly evident in the details of the report underlines the point that the US corporate sector is in great shape. A strong domestic economy is driving output and new orders while a fairly soft dollar and strong global demand are boosting exports. The non-manufacturing survey shows business activity jumping five points while new orders jumped six points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index has only been higher on two occasions in the past twelve years. Employment is also looking very strong at 56.8 versus the 50 break even level, which gives us confidence to assert that any softness in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls report relating to hurricane effects will be swiftly reversed in coming months. As such today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report reinforces our view that the only thing stopping a December hike is the potential for debt ceiling issues coming to a head, risking a government shutdown around year-end. Inflation wise, the price paid component indicates that the decline in inflation rates seen through this year will soon come to an end and the Fed is right to assert that disinflation was merely transitory. More on what the latest ISM surveys - manufacturing and non-manufacturing - say about the strength of the US economy: US crude inventories dropped sharply last week, and by significantly more than expected. They fell by 6.02m barrels to 464.96m, compared with expectations of a 0.8m decline. But gasoline stocks grew by more than expected, up 1.64m barrels rather than 1.1m. But there may be some divergence between the survey and the official data, suggests Nordsea economist Johnny Bo Jakobsen: Anthony Nieves, ISM chair, said: The non-manufacturing sector has reflected strong growth in the month of September despite the impact on the supply chain from the recent hurricanes. Respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments indicate a good outlook for business conditions. And here are some comments from the survey: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricane Irma caused a revenue challenge that will take some time to recover from, interrupting business operations in that region and offsetting growth in others.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business continues to grow at a good pace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153General outlook looking up, with sales picking up. That will drive spend and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Information) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, consistent growth in construction/office renovation jobs. Eight percent more jobs and 6 percent more revenue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Positive business trends continue in second half. Business results above plan and higher year-to-year. Forecast above planned results for 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business still in a down trend due to lack of capital investment in worldwide mining market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Mining) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurricane Harvey has been a disruption to normal business activity in the oil and gas industry. Refineries and petrochemical plants were shut down due to the storm, as were many offices along the Gulf Coast. Business is just now returning to some sense of normalcy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued growth; however, slower pace than in past. Expecting some further disruptions due to weather in Texas and Florida.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Retail Trade) In contrast, the Institute for Supply Management service sector survey has come in much stronger than expected. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI for September was 59.8, up from 55.3 in August and higher than the 55.5 expected by analysts. This is the highest level since August 2005. The new orders index jumped from 57.1 in August to 63. Commenting on the survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Given the disruption caused by recent hurricanes, some pull-back in business activity was understandable, so the resilient reading of the September services PMI makes for encouraging reading. Looked at alongside the manufacturing PMI, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised rate of just over 2% in the third quarter. Growth is largely reliant on the services economy, however, as manufacturing lags behind, struggling in part due to the strong dollar. While rebuilding and a return to normal business conditions after the hurricanes will hopefully boost growth in the fourth quarter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying to see business expectations about activity levels over the coming year drop in September. Measured across both manufacturing and services, future optimism is at its lowest since February, suggesting companies have become increasingly cautious about the outlook. However, while optimism has slipped, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey data on recent output, new orders and hiring trends remain solid. Combined with the further upturn in price pressures seen in September, the survey data will further fuel expectations that the Fed will be keen to hike interest rates again before the year is out. Average prices charged for goods and services rose at the fastest rate for three years in September, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not yet clear how much of the rise reflected short-term hurricane effects. The first of two US service sector survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shows a better than expected outcome, although a slight decline on the previous month. The Markit final service sector PMI for September came in at 55.3 compared to an initial reading of 55.1, but down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 56. There was a similar pattern for the composite PMI, up from an initial 54.6 to 54.8 but down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.3. As expected the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened marginally lower, but soon regained positive territory. The Dow fell 3 points initially after its record breaking run, but is currently up 9 points as investors await the latest service sector data. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.14% lower. The non-farm payroll numbers will probably be below the ADP figures, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Meanwhile in America, the latest jobs figures have beaten expectations. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, a report from payroll processor ADP showed that US private employers added 135,000 jobs in September. This was above the Reuters forecast of a rise of 125,000. The increase came despite hurricane Harvey and Irma, although the report did show smaller retailers were hit hard by the storms. If the non-farm figures also come in above estimates, that will give more credence to a possible US interest rate rise before the end of the year. The better than expected data is not set to help Wall Street, however, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open slightly lower after its recent record breaking run. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housebuilders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reacted to another Theresa May announcement - an extra \u00c2\u00a32bn for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affordable housing programme. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably because the plan will only make a small dent in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing shortage, by building an extra 5,000 social rented homes a year. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy providers are sliding, after Theresa May told the Conservative Party conference that the government will introduce a new price cap Centrica, which runs British Gas, has shed 6% , while SSE are down 3%. That sends Centrica down to its lowest level since early 2004. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics liveblog has more details (including the astonishing sight of a comedian handing May a P45 during her speech, and a lot of interruptions for coughing as the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice faltered). Back in the City, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may not be strong enough to support an interest rate hike, especially with Brexit looming. In a new report, S&amp;P argues that the Bank of England has been talking up the idea of rate rises soon, to stop the pound sliding. S&amp;P says: We remain a bit skeptical as to how justified such a hike would be in the near term. One rate rise may come in November, but further increases aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justifiable given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak wage growth, S&amp;P argues: Overall, we believe the Bank and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent statements are primarily aimed at propping up sterling to reduce imported inflation pressures. This strategy may include an actual 25 basis point hike in November, thus bringing the policy rate back to where it was before the Brexit referendum. Additional moves in 2018 do not appear warranted on the back of a slowing economy. S&amp;P also warns that there is a high risk that Britain suffers a disruptive Brexit. It points to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tangible lack of progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in talks with Brussels and the ongoing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infighting within the U.K. political establishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Inequality Ana Arendar has welcomed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling against Amazon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cosy deals that let companies slash their tax bills show how the global tax system is open to abuse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate tax avoidance robs countries around the world of billions each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c money that could be used to fight poverty. Poor countries are hit hardest as they are more dependent on tax revenue from companies to pay for public services like life-saving healthcare and clean water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Governments need to tighten tax rules to ensure companies pay their fair share of tax. In the meantime, the UK Government should not delay implementing laws to require British multinationals to publically report their activities for each country where they do business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Jennifer Rankin on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state aid decisions: Amazon has been ordered to repay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m (\u00c2\u00a3222m) by EU authorities, after a ruling that the technology company benefited from illegal and unfair state aid from Luxembourg. The European commission also announced on Wednesday that it planned to take the the Irish government to the European court of justice (ECJ) over its failure to collect \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in unpaid taxes from Apple, in relation to an earlier ruling. Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner in charge of competition, said Luxembourg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal tax advantages to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had allowed almost three-quarters of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits to go untaxed, allowing it to pay four times less tax than local rivals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an illegal practice under EU state aid rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vestager said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Member states may not grant selective tax concessions to multinational groups to which other companies do not have access.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The commission said Amazon had benefited from an illegal tax deal granted by the Luxembourg authorities that allowed the company to artificially reduce its tax bill by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m from 2006 to 2014. The company has been ordered to repay the full amount plus interest. Amazon rejected the findings of the commission investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jennifer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry says the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to take it to court is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Dublin insists that it is making significant progress in recovering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of taxes from Apple, even though it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with that ruling. Q: Are you concerned that there could be a proliferation of sweetheart tax deals in the UK after Brexit? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why the situation would change, Vestager replies. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it now, why have it later? She argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political direction and administrative practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd determine what kind of tax system a country runs. Luxembourg has issued a statement, arguing that Amazon did not benefit from state aid (as the EC claim): Luxembourg has taken notice of the decision by the European Commission in the Amazon case. Luxembourg will use appropriate due diligence to analyse the decision and reserves all its rights. The decision of the Commission refers to a period going back to 2006. Over time, both the international and the Luxembourg legal frameworks have substantially evolved. As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible State aid, as foreseen by article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Luxembourg has been fully cooperating with the Commission in its investigation and is strongly committed to tax transparency and the fight against harmful tax avoidance. Luxembourg fully adheres to the OECD/G20 BEPS project, which modernizes international tax rules and creates a global level playing field. Q: Can member states claim some of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m tax bill for themselves? Vestager suggests this is unlikely (ie, because the money should have been paid to the Luxembourg tax offices). Q: Could today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions make member states more worried that the EC is interfering in their tax affairs? Vestager says she hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard this sort of complaint. Member States understand the importance of an effective tax system in the world of digital commerce and large multinationals. Amazon has rejected the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that it illegally avoided paying enough tax in Europe, and may appeal. In a statement, it says: We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: The US government is considering changing its tax rules so it can tax the trillions of dollars which are currently parked overseas by American companies. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your advice for them? Vestager declines to advise the US government on this issue. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focused on getting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax system to work properly. Q: How did Amazon evade tax in Luxembourg, if it was recording revenues there? Vestager explains that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating company was paying unacceptably high royalties to the holding company, which lowered its taxable income. Q: Could this ruling spark a trade war with America? Vestager denies that the EC is targeting US companies. Businesses in Europe need to know they are on a level playing field, she replies. There is no bias in our rulings. They are about ensuring there is competition in Europe, whatever your flag and your ownership. Onto questions. Q: Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour occurred when [Commissioner president] Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg. So was he guilty, or negligent? Commissioner Vestager says the EC investigates behaviour by a member state, rather than conducting a criminal investigation trying to incriminate anyone. Commissioner Vestager then turns to Apple. She explains that the EC is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice, because it has failed to collect a year-old tax bill worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn from tech giant Apple. Vestager suggests Dublin is dragging its feet on this issue... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand that recovery in certain cases maybe more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But member states need to make sufficient progress to restore competition. Background: Last August, the EC penalised Apple for having received unfair deals from Ireland that cut its effective corporate tax rate. That ruling was disputed by the tech company, and the government of Ireland. Vestager insists that the EU isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fining Amazon. We are removing an illegal advantage that it should never have received in the first place, she says. The message is that all companies need to pay their taxes, as the huge majority of companies do, she adds firmly. Margrethe Vestager says Amazon used an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153empty shell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a holding company in Luxembourg to shift profits out of Europe. This holding company had no employees and no offices, she says, and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in developing intellectual property. Instead, it was simply there to cut Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax bill, and ensure that three-quarters of sales in Europe were untaxed. This chart from the EU shows how it was done: Vestager says that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax deal with Luxembourg was unfair, because a local company would have paid four times as much tax on the same profits. NEWSFLASH: The EC is demanding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m from Amazon, to cover the unfair tax advantages it received from basing its European operations in Luxembourg. Those tax benefits are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal under EU state aid rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells the press conference in Brussels. She adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits were not taxed. Vestager says Amazon must repay the benefits of that deal, plus interest. In another move, the EU is also taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of tax from Apple, following a ruling against the US tech giant in August 2016. Over in Brussels, European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is preparing to give a press conference on state aid. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to announce that the EC is hitting Amazon with a tax bill over its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsweetheart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal with Luxembourg. You can watch it online here. Some background. Amazon Europe is based in Luxembourg and aggregates the billions of pounds of sales the retailer makes from individual countries across the continent, It emerged in August that Amazon paid just \u00c2\u00a315m in tax on European revenues of \u00c2\u00a319.5bn which were reported through Luxembourg in 2016. James Smith of ING is concerned that new business growth cooled last month: At 53.6, the UK services PMI was a little better than hoped. But dig a little deeper and the key takeaway for us was the fact new business growth is at a 13-month low. With the current PMI roughly indicating growth in the 0.3% region, this latter point means that growth over the next couple of quarters could be equally as sluggish. Once again, political uncertainty was a key factor in holding back growth. It is possible that we see some recovery over the next few months; the fact that the UK government is more united behind the idea of a transition period could help unlock some short-term investment. But a lack of full agreement on the terms or length of such an arrangement, or indeed the ultimate Brexit deal, is likely to keep businesses cautious. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says the drop in new business will knock growth: Chris Sood-Nicholls of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking is encouraged that the headline Services PMI rose last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This slight increase in the index is encouraging, particularly given a backdrop of mixed economic signals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sector still faces a period of uncertainty surrounding Brexit, a sentiment echoed in Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent decision to downgrade the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to Aa2 from Aa1. Those consumer facing parts of the sector will also be mindful of the potential for an interest rate rise in the coming months, particularly as we head into one of the busiest trading periods of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted a nice graph showing all the PMI data this week: The drop in new orders across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector last month is a serious concern, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a stagnation trend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is developing in the sector, with firms unwilling to take risks until they know how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is playing out. Brock explains; Where consumers recovered a little from their spending hesitation last month, it was the turn of businesses to be spooked into inactivity, exerting greater scrutiny over new projects and long-term spending plans. The pressure of Brexit and resulting uncertainty were at the heart of this indecision. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all Sector PMI, which measures growth across the UK economy, has hit its lowest level since the EU referendum, and the second worst in over four years. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector strengthened last month. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI, which tracks activity at thousands of UK firms, has risen to 53.6 for September, up from 53.2 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates a small acceleration. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome news, following data earlier this week showing that factory growth slowed while construction actually shrank in September. But.... service sector bosses also warned that new orders rose at the slowest rate in 13 months. Many told Markit that customers were delaying signing off on large projects due to Brexit related uncertainty [something the Lord Mayor of London will understand.....]. Firms were also hit by rising prices, with input cost inflation hitting a seven month high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to rising food, energy and fuel bills, alongside increased prices for imported items and greater staff salaries, Markit says. Chris Williamson of Markit estimates that the UK economy probably only grew by 0.3% in the last quarter -- matching its growth earlier this year. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The services sector saw another month of modest growth, running in the middle ground between the robust expansion seen in manufacturing and the contraction recorded in construction. The three PMI surveys put the economy on course for another subdued 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter could see even slower growth..... The surveys therefore portray an economy struggling with the unwelcome combination of sluggish growth and rising prices, presenting a dilemma for policymakers. More to follow.... Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery strengthened further last month, indicating that it continues to grow faster than the UK. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit. Its monthly PMI survey of companies across the region has jumped to 56.7 in September, up from 55.7 in August, which shows the fastest growth in four months. Germany, Ireland and France led the way, with firms reporting that output expanded and new orders surged. Job creation was also strong, rising at almost the fastest rate in a decade. No wonder some in the City keep talking about a euroboom.... Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Market says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to have grown by around 0.7% in the third quarter of 2017. The jump in new orders suggests growth will remain strong this autumn. Williamson adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth is also becoming increasingly broadbased, which should help make the upturn more sustainable as corporate profits, labour markets and demand improve across the region. The eurozone therefore looks increasingly able to withstand any political shocks and set for a strong end to the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While the City of London worries about Brexit, the German stock market has just hit a new all-time high. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, though, is flat this morning, having hit a seven-week high yesterday. The Lord Mayor is absolutely right when he says that banks urgently need clarity over Brexit. Several of the biggest firms in the City have already begun shifting jobs overseas; JP Morgan is buying a new office block in Dublin, for example, and Standard Chartered is opening a subsidiary in Frankfurt. But as this graph from Bloomberg shows, thousands more jobs could yet move, depending how negotiations play out. The Lord Mayor of London is urging the UK government to finalise a legally binding Brexit transition period by the end of the year, or risk serious damage to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. Andrew Parmley will warn that banks need to plan ahead, and cannot risk a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that would badly hurt the UK economy. Lord Mayor Parmley will issue the warning at the annual City Banquet - a swanky event at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House tonight. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to welcome Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal of a two-year transition deal after March 2019 - calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. But he insists that this is nailed down within three months, so that financial companies have some clarity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We owe it to the sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to the global financial system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to do all we can not only to maintain our collaborative approach, but to enhance it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is why we cannot have a cliff-edge at the moment of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c businesses must have the certainty of how they will be regulated, and that requires a transition period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal on transition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this will be our bridge to the future. But the idea must become reality, translated into a legal agreement before the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer this is left, the more it damages all our futures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only in the UK, but the economy right across the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also need to know more about the final state, after transition. How can the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most profitable industry be expected to programme its satnav without knowing the destination?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parmley also blasted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economically illiterate calls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to impose new cross-border financial barriers between London and the rest of the world. Parmley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post is mainly ceremonial*. But he does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspeak for the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and this speech is a reminder that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial district isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as upbeat about Brexit as certain government MPs, who seem to think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re re-enacting Agincourt.... Andrew Bailey, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority and Sam Woods, head of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority, are also speaking at tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. Surely they will touch on Brexit too? * - correction, the Lord Mayor isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unelected, as I wrote earlier. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected by residents and businesses in the Square Mile. Apologies for the error. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today is services PMI day, when we learn how service sector companies around the globe fared last month. So, after some underwhelming UK construction and factory data yesterday, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to learn how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant services sector coped in the face of rising inflation and political uncertainty in September City economists expect little improvement on August, so the PMI could be unchanged at 53.2 - a level that shows steady growth. Anything below that will heighten concerns that growth is weakening. Royal Bank of Canada say: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI services report follows weak numbers in both manufacturing (Monday) and construction (yesterday). It is one of the final clues for the initial estimate of Q3 GDP on 25 October (RBC: 0.2%q/q). We see downside risk to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number as well on the back of relatively weak business expectations in recent months Also coming up today.... European traders will be watching events in Spain again, after Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president claimed the region would declare independence \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the end of this week or the beginning of next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last night, the King of Spain weighed in, criticising the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunacceptable disloyalty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders. Could direct rule from Madrid be next? CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson says: Having miscalculated so badly with their reaction at the weekend it would appear that Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy is in no mood to compromise and looking to double down. While he is well within his rights under the terms of the law of the constitution it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see how this can end in any other way than badly, and for that history may well judge him harshly. Any further misjudgements by the Spanish government could well also increase the pressure on the EU to come off the fence that it has been so busy trying to stay on, with respect to last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. It could be an expensive morning for Amazon. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (EU) competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is hit the e-commerce giant with a massive bill for back taxes related to its tax arrangement with Luxembourg. Vestager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement could come at 11am UK time. In the City, supermarket chain Tesco has reinstated its dividend and reported a 2.2% rise in like-for-like UK sales in the last quarter. Shareholders will get one shiny penny for each share they own - a small benefit, but as they say, every little helps (sorry). Flooring firm Topps Tiles is also reporting results, and has warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am: Eurozone services PMI for September. Likely to show another month of solid growth, with economists predicting the PMI will be unchanged at 55.6. 9.30am: UK services PMI for September. The City will be hoping that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major economic sector shrugged off Brexit worries last month. 10am: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Reserve Bank of India is likely to leave borrowing cost unchanged. 10am: Eurozone retail sales. Economists predict a 0.3% rise in September. 3pm: US services PMI. After strong factory data on Monday, will America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector also sparkle? Probably.... Tonight: City Banquet at Mansion House",

Connor Campbell. financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm jobs report only made the week worse for cable, despite a rather unpleasant headline figure.</p> <p>The non-farm number itself was as ugly as they come. For the first time in 7 years the reading came in negative, at -33k against the 82k forecast and the (upwards revised) 169k seen in August. Yet while the figure was far worse than expected, it actually wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t <em>that</em> surprising given it covered a period impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.</p> <p>Instead of lingering on the shrinking non-farm payrolls, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention turned to rest of the jobs report. Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus.</p> <p>The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen...</p> <p>And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent.

Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December.</p> <p>So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable...</p> <p>Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since November 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures.</p> <p>Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports.</p> <p>This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and inflation is heading back towards target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. </p> <p>The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently easy monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse implications for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018.</p> </blockquote> <p>Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike.</p> <p>There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prodigal son\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: wage growth.

                "bodyText":"A stronger euro left European markets flagging, not helped by the continuing concerns about the stand-off between the Spanish government and Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence promoters. But with the pound suffering amid the latest political uncertainties in the wake of the Tory party conference, the FTSE 100 managed to edge higher by the end of trading, with its overseas earners benefitting from the prospect of a weaker sterling. A mixed bag for the US, with an unexpected fall in jobs balanced by a rise in wage growth, left Wall Street slipping back from record highs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.88 points or 0.2% at 7522.87 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.09% to 12,955.94 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.36% lower at 5359.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.77% to 22,392.31 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.29% lower at 10,185.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.10% to 745.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. A mixture of profit taking and concerns about oversupply have brought a rally in the oil price to an abrupt end. Hopes that producers would extend their agreement to cap output and reduce a supply glut have supported crude prices recently. But they have slipped back after Russia clarified that President Putin had not, as suggested, proposed extending the production cut agreement although he thought it was a possibility. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister also sounded lukewarm about an extension until the end of 2018, saying he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about it. Rising US crude exports have also been taken as a negative factor, along with the re-opening of Libya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil field. The approach of tropical storm Nate to the US Gulf coast is not helping matters either. So Brent crude is currently down 2.7% at $55.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 3.25% to $49.14. The pound continues to flounder against the dollar, both on worries about the political situation in the UK and of course, the strength of the US currency as the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December increases. At the moment the pound is down 0.53% at $1.3047, albeit off its worst levels. Connor Campbell. financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm jobs report only made the week worse for cable, despite a rather unpleasant headline figure. The non-farm number itself was as ugly as they come. For the first time in 7 years the reading came in negative, at -33k against the 82k forecast and the (upwards revised) 169k seen in August. Yet while the figure was far worse than expected, it actually wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that surprising given it covered a period impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Instead of lingering on the shrinking non-farm payrolls, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention turned to rest of the jobs report. Wage growth jumped significantly month-on-month, from 0.2% to 0.5%, while the unemployment rate hit a fresh 16 year low of 4.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to see those numbers as tipping the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish/hawkish scales towards the latter, with a December rate hike now coming into sharper focus. The dollar reacted as one would expect, widening its gains against the pound.., while taking 0.1% off the euro and half a percent off the yen... And what of poor, fragile sterling? Well September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super surge is looking more and more like an anomaly, the Tories once again finding a way to undermine confidence in the currency. Cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuck at a sub-$1.305 one month nadir, while against the euro the pound has cemented a fresh 3 week low after falling half a percent. And the thing is, there is no guarantee that next week will be any better, especially if the weekend papers are as filled with Tory infighting as one would expect. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the US jobs data. Dominic Rushe writes: The US jobs market stalled in September, losing 33,000 jobs, as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll. It was the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. The US economy had added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year but as the labor department had predicted the storms, which caused fatal and catastrophic damage across Texas and Florida, slowed hiring. But a loss in jobs was far worse than the 80,000 new jobs most US economists had expected would be created. It ends the longest stretch of uninterrupted jobs growth in US history. This was the first loss in jobs since September 2010. Ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report the Bureau of Labor Statistics said some 11.2 million workers lived in the affected areas, about 7.7% of the US workforce. Employment in food services and drinking places declined by 105,000 in September. That sector has added an average of 24,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. The unemployment rate, which was 4.4% in August, fell to 4.2%, a 16-year low. This is the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. In August the economy added 156,000 new jobs, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. The full story is here: After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have paused for breath. Despite the weaker headline jobs figure, the dollar has strengthened on the basis that higher than expected wages growth means the Federal Reserve may well raise interest rates before the end of the year. In turn, that has put a small dampener on equities. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 21 points or 0.09% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.25%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the jobs report data: The dollar has moved higher following the US jobs data, despite a fall in the headline figure. Analysts point to the strong pay growth giving the Federal Reserve leeway to raise rates in December. So sterling has hit a four week low against the dollar, while the US currency was at its strongest level against the euro since mid-August. Against the yen, the greenback hit its highest since mid-July. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: Hurricane disruption dragged payrolls negative, but a big fall in unemployment and significant wage increases make a December rate hike look probable... Despite the softness in payrolls the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.4%. The other big number is the 0.5% month on month jump in wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since November 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which takes the annual wage growth number up to 2.9%. Note that there were also some upward revisions to monthly wage rates so we may finally be seeing some of the strength in jobs feeding through into inflation pressures. Payrolls will bounce back strongly given the Bureau for Labour Statistics suggests that 1.47mn people were unable to get to work because of storm disruption. Moreover, labour demand indicators remain strong in other reports. This positive overall story on the labour market is only going to strengthen the case for higher interest rates. We already know that the growth outlook is strong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c underlined by the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys hitting 13 and 12 year highs respectively this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and inflation is heading back towards target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI expected at 2.1% and core at 1.8% year on year. The arguments justifying higher interest rates is also being broadened with Fed Chair Yellen suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently easy monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adverse implications for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat rich\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset valuations. Relatively loose financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a flat yield curve and dollar weakness - have been used as arguments that could justify action by other Fed officials. It therefore seems that the main risk to our December rate hike call is politics and the potential for an economically and market disruptive government shutdown. However, we remain hopeful that this can be avoided clearing the way for another two rate hikes in 2018. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, market analyst at Monex Europe, said: Headline job creation had a rough time in September. Although a significant slowdown was expected after the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical storms, not many forecasts were expecting to see a contraction. The most important surprise, however, comes from a significant increase in wage growth and a new drop in the unemployment rate to fresh 16-year lows. Wage growth has been the last piece of the inflation puzzle for the Federal Reserve over the last several quarters, as it remained stubbornly low despite a strong economic recovery and continued new lows in the unemployment rate. Albeit late, wage growth finally made an appearance in September with a massive increase well above expectations. Despite the contraction in employment, the three-month average of headline job creation remains above 100.000 jobs/month, which will not discourage the Fed from a hike. There can be no more doubt, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before year end as already strong data now has the support of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prodigal son\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: wage growth. This suggests the economy will grow at a strong pace in the last quarter of the year. Here is a chart showing clearly the impact on leisure and hospitality jobs: And here is the unemployment data and monthly changes: Other key figures from the non-farms report show the overall jobless rate fell unexpectedly to 4.2% from 4.4%. Pay growth was also better-than-expected, picking up to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August. Economists were predicting a smaller rise to 0.3%. The impact on jobs of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma was far greater than economists had predicted in September. The 33,000 fall in non-farm payrolls was the first drop in seven years after workers were displaced and firms delayed hiring. There was a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sectors. Employment in food services and drinking places fell by 105,000 in September, in an industry where most workers are not paid when absent from work. William Wiatrowski, acting commissioner at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, provided some context to the figures: In September, a sharp employment decline in food services and drinking places and below-trend growth in some other industries likely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The storms caused large-scale evacuations and severe damage to many homes and businesses. In the establishment survey, employees who are not paid for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month are not counted as employed. Many employees in areas affected by the hurricanes were likely off payrolls during the reference pay period for September. In September, 1.5 million workers had a job but were not at work for the entire reference week due to bad weather, the highest level for this series over the past 20 years. This series is highly sensitive to the timing of weather events and thus does not capture the immediate effect of all such events on the job market. Payrolls actually fell by 33,000 last month in figures just out, far worse than expected. Economists had predicted 90,000 jobs would be added. Figures for August were revised up to show 169,000 jobs were added (up from a previous estimate of 156,000). More soon... Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, is speaking about trust at the Royal Society of Arts in London. He says that in some ways, loss of trust in institutions is the very definition of a financial crisis, including the most recent one which has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely trust-busting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even as the scars of this crisis heal, this trust deficit might not repair itself naturally. The trust deficit that those in money and finance face may be not cyclical, not temporary, but structural and permanent. And if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, then those of us within financial services, including central banks, will really have to go some to repair that deficit. US non-farm payrolls for September are coming up at 1.30pm. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting the number of jobs added last month fell sharply to 90,000, from 156,000 in August, largely as a result of hurricane disruption. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has announced it is extending its investigations to other 2 Sisters poultry plants in England and Wales, as well as its scandal-hit West Bromwich chicken processing plant. It follows a Guardian and ITV News investigation that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. The FSA said that while it had not identified food safety issues at West Bromwich, the inspection \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highlighted issues requiring management attention, for example in relation to some aspects of staff training and stock control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Heather Hancock, chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said it was extending its investigation until it is satisfied that there is no risk to public health. Over in Greece pensioners have been protesting outside the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest administrative court against further cuts demanded by international creditors. It is the second such demonstration this week as anger mounts over the spectre of yet more cutbacks next year. Helena Smith reports. Gathering outside the Council of State, pensioners shouted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shame on you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as judges met to consider the legality of pensions being further trimmed back. Since the onset of the crisis in late 2009, pensions have been cut 12 times with unionists claiming some 1.5 million retirees are now living on less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 a month. The latest reforms would mean yet more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic reductions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier this week pensioners took to the streets in another show of anger, holding large banners deploring the cuts. With unemployment still hovering around 22%, families are often forced to survive on the pensions of elderly members. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis has hit retirees harder than perhaps any other age group. An estimated 22.2% of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely materially deprived\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unable to fend for themselves, or pay basic bills, according to the EU statistics agency, Eurostat. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item forecasting group, has analysed the UK productivity figures and says Brexit negotiations could further hold back progress: There is a risk that prolonged uncertainty may end up weighing down markedly on business investment and damage productivity. Prolonged difficult Brexit negotiations could increase this risk. This could also be compounded if foreign companies markedly reduce their investment in the UK, diluting any beneficial spill-over of skills and knowledge. Read our full story on the figures here: Easyjet is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 with shares down 2.7% this morning. The low cost carrier is down despite flying a record 24.1m passengers in the three months to September. The airline also said in a trading update that it was on track to make annual profits of \u00c2\u00a3405-\u00c2\u00a3410m, at the higher end of its guidance but below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3495m. Investors are also nervous about what the future holds, after chief executive Carolyn McCall said industry conditions remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this morning: A separate report from the ONS shows that the UK was less productive than the average among the G7 advanced economies in 2016. Output per hour worked in the UK was 15.1% below the average in 2016, compared with 15.5% below in 2015. The UK was however more productive than Canada and Japan: Britain was less productive between April and June compared with the previous quarter, with output per hour worked down 0.1%. It was dragged down by the manufacturing sector, where productivity fell in the second quarter by 1.3% according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile services sector productivity was up 0.2% over the period. Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, said the weak figures do not bode well for UK wages, which are already rising at a slower rate than prices: Poor productivity performance underpins the stagnation of real wages, and presents the government with a particular challenge since it appears likely that previous forecasts of earnings, and hence also of tax revenues, have been overoptimistic. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, has this take on developments in Spain and the implications for markets: The IBEX has been hit by profit taking as yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive bounce back was short lived. The decision by Madrid to suspend the Catalan parliament is a short-term solution to the problem, as the two sides are still locked in a stalemate. The Spanish government is in the process of making it easier for companies headquartered in Catalonia to switch their head office to another part of Spain. While Madrid is keeping the pressure on Catalonia, it is likely that dealers will steer clear of the Spanish stock market. Spanish equities and government bonds are underperforming other European markets after Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of foreign affairs said the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament would meet on Monday. It is in defiance of Madrid, after the the Spanish constitutional court suspended the Catalan parliament, threatening more tensions and instability. The Spanish IBEX is down 0.8% at 10,138, while yields on benchmark 10-year bonds were up seven basis points at 1.76%. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors: Once again, the market has proved its resilience and confounded the doom mongers. Not that there is too much to get excited about with these figures which confirm what we have seen at the coalface recently - that prices are holding up reasonably well where vendors are realistic, partly in response to a continuing shortage of stock. Sadly, we are not seeing the hoped-for autumn bounce but a steady market is more than welcome with so much uncertain economic news. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is not convinced by the Halifax report: The sudden surge in Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of house prices\u00e2\u20ac\u201dup 3% over the last three months alone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis impossible to reconcile with all the other housing market evidence. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure is the most volatile of all the indices we track. Other surveys show that the pipeline of demand is soft; RICS has reported that new buyer enquiries have fallen in six of the last seven months. Real wages still have further to fall over the next six months and mortgage rates will rise soon in response to the increase in banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 funding costs. As such, we expect most of the pickup in Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index to unwind over the coming months. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says that a flight of equity from London is fuelling activity in the regions: In the current cautious market, prices treading water is good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stability plus gentle growth is very good. But momentum remains patchy and what growth there is is wavering rather than sustained, and prices remain under intense pressure in several key regions. In London, prices have been sliding in many of the areas that saw the frothiest rates of growth during the boom. On the flipside, the flight of equity from the capital is fuelling activity in several regional markets where affordability and perceived value for money is now enticing higher volumes of buyers. Halifax said UK house prices are partly being propped up by a shortage of homes on the market: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Annual house prices rose by 4% in September according to the Halifax price index. It was the strongest rate of growth since February, bucking the trend of other recent reports which have indicated a weakening market. Over the month, prices were up 0.8% reaching a record high of \u00c2\u00a3255,109, and smashing economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a 0.1% increase. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was also revised up to show 1.5% growth over the month, up from a previous estimate of 1.1%. House prices in the three months to September were 1.4% higher than in the previous quarter, the fastest quarterly increase since February. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax Community Bank: The annual rate of growth has picked up for the second consecutive month, rising from 2.6% in August to 4% in September. The average house price is now \u00c2\u00a3225,109 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest on record. UK house prices continue to be supported by an ongoing shortage of properties for sale and solid growth in full-time employment. However, increasing pressure on spending power and continuing affordability concerns may well dampen buyer demand. Investors and economists are increasingly betting that Bank of England policymakers will raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November. Galley says this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weigh on the housing market: There has been recent speculation on the possibility of a rise in the Bank of England base rate. We do not anticipate this will have a significant effect on transaction volumes. Wall Street hit fresh record highs on Thursday, with risk appetite among investors boosted by signs of a robust US economy. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.6% at 2,552.07. It was the sixth consecutive closing high for the first time in more than 20 years. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: A backdrop of strong economic data, optimism for corporate earnings in the third quarter and the recently released plan for tax cuts are fuelling the latest surge. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to revamp the US economy can live up to the hyped-up expectations but repeatedly fresh record highs indicate confidence not caution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty quiet in markets across Europe this morning, as markets await the main event at 1.30pm with the publication of the US non-farm payrolls report in September. Markets are feeling a little more relaxed about developments in Spain, where politicians in Catalonia do no seem able to agree on the best way forward. For now at least, that is helping to ease investor fears. In the UK the FTSE 100 is up just 9 points but is comfortably above the 7,500 mark, having gained 300 points in three weeks. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,517 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.02% at 12,971 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,371 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 22,476 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.4% at 10,177 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 390 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. The pound is under renewed pressure this morning as uncertainty builds over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future as Prime Minister. Grant Shapps, a Tory MP and a former party chairman, has admitted his role in a plan to put pressure on May to call a leadership election. He said MPs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfectly within their rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to call for a contest after May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gamble to win a bigger majority at the general election did not pay off. He told BBC radio 5 live: We did have a result that was not at all what anyone wanted, least of all what she wanted or anticipated, and... sometimes when things happen you have to take responsibility for them. This is a view I have held for quite some time and quite a lot of colleagues feel the same way, including five former cabinet ministers. The pound is down 0.4% at $1.3065. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest against the dollar since 7 September. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of dollar strength as traders bet on a December US interest rate rise. But the pound is also at a three-week low against the euro, down 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1169. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson gives this take: The pound has had another poor week its third weekly decline in a row, as concerns about political instability as well as disappointing economic data have undermined sentiment. seems likely that this discontent will once again amount to nothing more than hot air in the short term at least. The last thing the currency, the Conservative party and more importantly the country needs right now is the self-indulgence of another leadership battle. Also coming up today... 8.30am BST: September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halifax house prices report will provide the latest snapshot of the UK housing market. 9.30am BST: UK productivity figures for April to June. British productivity has been pretty dismal in recent years and policymakers believe improvement here is the key to unlocking stronger wage growth. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the latest. 1.30pm BST: The closely watched non-farm payrolls for September. Economists are predicting a sharp fall in the number of jobs added, to 90,000 in September, from 156,000 in August, as a result of hurricane disruption. The report will also give the latest insight into the pace of earnings growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy.",

Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. </p> \n   <p>Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. </p> \n   <p>However, as Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discount more rapidly early on. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db51c5e4b00593b4d681c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:39:33.231Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>(It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5188e4b00593b4d681c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:38:42.750Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e150180-3d83-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a\">an interview </a>with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) from last year.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db5059e4b00593b4d681c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:37:22.172Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives\">From Obama to Cameron, why do so many politicians want a piece of Richard Thaler?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4f2ce4b076f91939cd10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:30:37.737Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account.

Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. </p> \n   <p>One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4ec7e4b076f91939cd0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:26:34.349Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaciorekMagda/status/917332227087831040\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\">Noblista Richard Thaler wyst\u00c4\u2026pi\u00c5\u201a w jednej ze scen filmu The Big Short.

He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><strong>Limited rationality:</strong> Thaler developed the theory of <em>mental accounting,</em> explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of <em>behavioural finance,</em> which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets.</p> \n   <p><strong>Social preferences:</strong> Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretical and experimental research on <em>fairness</em> has been influential. He showed how consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the <em>dictator game,</em> an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world.</p> \n   <p><strong>Lack of self-control:</strong> Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a <em>planner-doer model, </em>which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how <em>nudging</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term he coined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T10:55:03.398Z\">at 11.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4683e4b00593b4d68193\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:51:51.144Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thaler is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler\">professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago</a>.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db45c5e4b076f91939ccdf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:49:06.887Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:51:29.932Z\">at 10.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db4595e4b00593b4d6818a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:47:45.560Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db1f31e4b00593b4d680ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:35:07.827Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-f_6zhUOPQ\"> \n   <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-f_6zhUOPQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:41:05.737Z\">at 10.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db3fa1e4b076f91939ccb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:21:40.819Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/917316544971067392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Turkey?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Turkey</a>'s lira is now the second-worst emerging currency this year. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRY&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$TRY</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7rJip0LSSp\">pic.twitter.com/7rJip0LSSp</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/917316544971067392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db38ece4b00593b4d6814d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T09:03:12.029Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish lira under pressure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground.</p> \n  <p>The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/us-suspends-handling-of-visas-in-turkey-after-arrest-of-consulate-staffer\">has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey</a> after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency.</p> \n  <p>The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sterling is using Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather severe losses.</p> \n   <p>One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond.</p> \n   <p>However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has eased some of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears.</p> \n   <p>Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery.</p> \n   <p>Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too enthused about the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell. The Eurozone indices were far perkier; the DAX hit a new high after climbing 0.3%, and is inches away from crossing 13000, while the CAC surged 0.5% to graze 5375.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db2649e4b076f91939cc59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T07:33:32.903Z\">8.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisBab/status/917289372227006464\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It's fake Nobel prize day everybody! <a href=\"https://t.co/34lK2jPsU5\">pic.twitter.com/34lK2jPsU5</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Yiannis \u00ce\u2019aboulias (@YiannisBab) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisBab/status/917289372227006464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59db242ae4b076f91939cc52\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-09T07:28:27.281Z\">8.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Millennium and Copthorne jumps 23%</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One notable mover in the markets in hotels group Millennium and Coptthorne.</p> \n  <p>Its shares have soared 23% to 554p on news that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City Developments has offered to buy the shares in the group it does not already own.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone to US economist Richard Thaler for his work on behavioural economics. He plans to spend the prize money \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrationally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he told the awards committee. Here is our news story on the award: And here is an explanation of his speciality, behavioural economics: On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Thaler will be giving a news conference in Chicago later, and here are the details: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Lewis, author of the book The Big Short which was subsequently made into the film in which Richard Thaler appeared, on the new Nobel prize winner, from 2015. And here is Thaler and Selena Gomez in that very film: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Just over a year ago Thaler and fellow Nobel prize winning economist Eugene Fama took part in an interesting debate about whether markets were efficient or irrational. He also commented on Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech - not the parts that received the most commentary - but on her organ donor plans, in response to another tweet: Thaler has criticised the Brexit vote as a prime example of irrational behaviour. He told Business Insider just ahead of the UK referendum vote: Most voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really thinking about it in a very analytical way\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The people behind the leave campaign are voting with their guts. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no spreadsheet. This is much like a divorce without a prenup. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re voting to leave, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take care of all the financial details later. Thaler was apparently slow to wake up when the committee called him with the news of his award, but was unsurprisingly pleased with the news. His biography on the University of Chicago website lists one of his interests as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine wine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which will no doubt be part of a celebration later. His personal website is here but so far, no mention of the Nobel prize. Here is one of the committee members talking about Thaler, and explaining what behavioural economics is: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award: The 2017 Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to the US academic Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his contribution to behavioural economics. The prize, worth 9m Swedish kroner (\u00c2\u00a3845,000), is not among the Nobel Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official awards for literature, peace, medicine, physics and chemistry, but was established separately by Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in memory of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described Thaler as a pioneer of behavioural economics, which had progressed in recent years from a fringe and somewhat controversial field of research into a mainstream component of the economics profession. His research was praised for incorporating psychological assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. The prize-givers said his work had shown how the limitations of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge in the decision-making process, as well as the consequences of social preferences and a lack of self control, can affect people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions as well as market outcomes. Thaler, born in New Jersey in 1945, is a career academic and a Charles R Walgreen distinguished service professor of behavioural science and economics, and the director of the Center for Decision Research at the University of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Booth School of Business. He made a cameo appearance in the 2015 film The Big Short, sitting beside Selina Gomez at a blackjack table. He is a leading proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nudge theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a concept of behavioural science that suggests small interventions in the environment, or incentives, can encourage people to make different decisions. The full report is here: Here is the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on self-control: In the twelfth song of the Odyssey, Circe warns Odysseus about the Sirens, who lure sailors with their enchanting singing. Odysseus who, like his crew, wanted to return home to Ithaca, solves the problem by plugging the crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears with beeswax and then tying himself to the mast, with strict orders to the crew to ignore whatever he says until they are out of harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem is the epitome of this dilemma at all levels of our life, when we are tested by short-term temptations that threaten long-term wellbeing. This could be food and drink, smoking, consumption, saving for distant goals, or post-retirement planning. A person who chooses a longer education has a lower income during their studies, but can in return look forward to benefits in the future. Experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness than those that are further off; a thousand krona next year is perceived as worth less than a thousand krona today, regardless of whether it is an income or an expense. In traditional economic theory this is described using discounting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the assumption is that both income and expenses reduce by a constant factor with every passing month or year. Using such an assumption, the ranking of two future alternatives will always remain the same. However, as Odysseus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dilemma demonstrates, it is possible to change your mind when choosing between two options. The explanation is that experiences that are close in time take up more of our awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we discount more rapidly early on. (It almost goes without saying of course, that Thaler was not one of the favourites to win the economics prize). And here is an interview with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) from last year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from 2008 by Aditya Chakrabortty on Thaler, including how he was being wooed by the UK conservative party: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the citation on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research on fairness, complete with umbrella anecdote: When making decisions, people not only take what is beneficial to themselves into account. They also have ideas about what is fair, and they can consider other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare in both a positive way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through cooperation or solidarity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a negative way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as through jealousy or malice. Large-scale experiments conducted by Richard Thaler and other behavioural economists, have shown that notions about fairness play a major role in decision-making. People are prepared to refrain from material benefits to maintain what they perceive as just distributions. They are also prepared to bear a personal cost for punishing others who violate basic fairness rules, not only when they themselves are affected but also when they see someone else affected by injustice. One frequent objection is that results from laboratory experiments cannot be transferred to real life, but it is easy to find examples where fairness considerations have an impact outside the laboratory. Unexpected rain can create an unexpectedly high demand for umbrellas, but if a shopkeeper then raises their price to match the high demand, many consumers react negatively and feel that the shopkeeper has behaved greedily. And here is Thaler in the Big Short, with Selena Gomez: One of Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theories is about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mental accounting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The citation describes this as using different reference points to help make decisions, which vary from situation to situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One reference point could be the price for which we bought an item, or the lowest price we find when searching on the internet, and we use this reference point to assess whether we have made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In his research, Thaler has provided numerous examples of how mental accounting using differing reference points may lead to decisions that appear strange when evaluated from a traditional economic perspective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An example: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A consumer who finds out that the watch she is about to buy is 100 Swedish krona cheaper in another shop. She chooses to go to the other shop if the watch costs 1,000 krona but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do so if it costs 10,000 krona even though the saving in krona is the same. The explanation is that she focuses on the percentage, rather than on the actual saving relative to the reference point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More on Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research is here. The citation defines behavioural economics as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a research field in which insights from psychological research are applied to economic decision-making. A behavioural perspective incorporates more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions, providing new opportunities for designing measures and institutions that increase societal benefit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The committee is asked about the lack of women winners of the Nobel prizes, and the panel says they are concerned and they are taking measures to improve the situation. They think things will improve and hope it will be different in five to ten years time. Thaler is asked about the Chinese economy, but says he is not really an expert on that. And he is now gone. He is asked about his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short Hollywood career\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - he was in The Big Short - saying someone successful in something is assumed to be successful going forward, and how that could apply to Donald Trump. Thaler says he is disappointed his Hollywood career was not part of the official speech giving him the award. As for Trump, he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he would do well to watch that movie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked how he will spend the prize money, Thaler says he will try to spend it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as irrationally as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thaler is on the phone to the press conference now. He is asked what the most important aspect of his research is. He says it is the recognition that economic agents are human, and that economic models have to incorporate that. The citation says Thaler has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. He has shown how the following three traits affect individual decision-making, as well as market outcomes: Limited rationality: Thaler developed the theory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect. He also showed how aversion to losses can explain why people value the same item more highly when they own it than when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Thaler was one of the founders of the field of behavioural finance, which studies how cognitive limitations influence financial markets. Social preferences: Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theoretical and experimental research on fairness has been influential. He showed how consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fairness concerns may stop firms from raising prices in periods of high demand, but not in times of rising costs. Thaler and his colleagues devised the dictator game, an experimental tool that has been used in numerous studies to measure attitudes to fairness in different groups of people around the world. Lack of self-control: Thaler has also shed new light on the old observation that New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolutions can be hard to keep. He showed how to analyse self-control problems using a planner-doer model, which is similar to the frameworks psychologists and neuroscientists now use to describe the internal tension between long-term planning and short-term doing. Succumbing to shortterm temptation is an important reason why our plans to save for old age, or make healthier lifestyle choices, often fail. In his applied work, Thaler demonstrated how nudging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term he coined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may help people exercise better self-control when saving for a pension, as well in other contexts. The committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard Thaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thaler is professor of behavioural sciences and economics at the University of Chicago. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is awarded to RIchard H Thaler for his contributions to behavourial economics. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. With just a few minutes to go, here is a live link to the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics, which is also at the top of this blog: Rising tensions with the US have hit the Turkish lira, which tumbled around 6% at one point before recovering some ground. The US has suspended handling all regular visa applications in Turkey after a member of its embassy staff was arrested, prompting a heavy fall in the Turkish currency. The lira is currently down 2.5% at 3.7 per dollar, having touched 3.9 overnight. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: The Turkish Lira was the worst performing currency early Monday, after the U.S. and Turkey announced the suspension of visa services for citizens looking to visit each country. Traders responded aggressively to the news, sending the Lira more than 6% lower against the U.S. currency - its steepest decline since 15 July 2016, when Turkey witnessed the bloodiest coup attempt in its political history. However, the Lira managed to recover more than half of its losses, as investors viewed the recent tensions as controllable. With Turkey increasing political ties with Russia and Iran, and Washington continuing to support Kurdish groups, the political risk premium is likely to keep pressuring the Lira. However, it would require far more escalation to see the currency trading near January lows of 3.94. Meanwhile the main Turkish stock market index, the BIST 100, has fallen 3.5%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something on the only woman to win the Economics prize: Here are some facts and figures about the Nobel Prize in economics: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s striking that only one woman has won the prize since it was first awarded in 1969. And if this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner is indeed one of the favourites, it will remain that way. Back with the pound, and the currency is shrugging off the latest Brexit worries and political problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling is using Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bone dry economic calendar as an opportunity to claw back some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather severe losses. One could argue that such a data-less day would only throw a harsher spotlight on the latest round of Tory turmoil. Predictably the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers were full of reports of party infighting, with one group urging Theresa May to say goodbye to Boris Johnson, and another, more Brexity cabal attacking the pro-EU Chancellor Phillip Hammond. However, sterling seems to have steeled itself somewhat over the weekend, calming the value-eroding jitters that plagued last Thursday and Friday. Perhaps the fact that nothing more dramatic happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no resignations or comments from Johnson etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has eased some of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears. Regardless, it is making a decent fist of taking the edge off its recent losses; cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4%, pushing the pound back above $1.31, while its half a percent rise against the euro sees it just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Of course, in the context the last few weeks, sterling is still struggling; the fact it has (so far) started the week on the right foot, however, is an important step on its potential road to recovery. Understandably, given its recent reliance on a weakened pound, the FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too enthused about the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, though it did manage to hold above 7500 after the bell. The Eurozone indices were far perkier; the DAX hit a new high after climbing 0.3%, and is inches away from crossing 13000, while the CAC surged 0.5% to graze 5375. One notable mover in the markets in hotels group Millennium and Coptthorne. Its shares have soared 23% to 554p on news that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City Developments has offered to buy the shares in the group it does not already own. The move values M&amp;C at around \u00c2\u00a31.8bn. Given City Developments already indirectly owns 65.2%, a bid for the rest should not have come as too much of a surprise to the market, but still, the offer at 552.5p a share looks generous enough. European markets have got off to a mixed start. The FTSE 100 is down 0.06%, not helped by the slight strengthening of the pound which is not helpful to the overseas earners which dominate the index. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.2% and ouched a new all time high while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has edged up 0.1%. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 0.6% despite the continuing concerns about Catalan independence. Earlier German industrial output beat expectations, rising 2.6% in August compared to a 0.1% fall in July and forecasts of a 0.7% increase. But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cynical reminder about predictions about the winners: Indeed last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winners, Oliver Hart of Harvard, and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of MIT, were not top of the lists of likely recipients. My colleague Richard Partington has been looking at the runners and riders, who include the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and a string of US academics. His full report is here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mainly be concentrating on the annual Nobel prize in economics, due to be announced in a few hours in Stockholm. And first things first. It comes up every year, but just to be clear, the economics prize is not one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Nobel prizes like the literature and peace awards handed out last week. Officially it is known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. It was set up by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank) in 1968 and is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the same principles as the Nobel prize. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the biggest prize in economics, worth 9m Swedish kronor (\u00c2\u00a3848,091) and awarded in the past to illustrious names such as John Hicks, Jan Tinbergen, John Nash, and Joseph Stiglitz, 78 in all since it was established. Last year it was won by UK-born Oliver Hart of Harvard University and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their work on contract theory, covering a range of issues from executive pay to public-private partnerships. It comes at a time when economists, and experts in general, have been coming under increasing pressure with the rise in populism and the dismissal by some of their worth (step forward Michael Gove for one). But with the global economy still suffering the effects of the financial crisis and the likes of Wolfgang Schaeuble warning of the prospect of another bubble, there is still a need for expert economic analysis. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon see who is deemed to be top of the field at the moment. The announcement is due around 11.45am in Sweden, or 10.45am in the UK.... Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet start to the week. The pound is edging higher against the dollar after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines, while stock markets are expected to be rather subdued to start with:",

We think that Congress will pass a small fiscal stimulus early next year and that this will help to boost US GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018, a touch higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of 2.3%.</p> <p>[On the UK] the headlines focussed on the 0.3pps downgrade to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 UK growth forecast from its projection in April. But this was partly due to the Fund catching up with weaker-than-expected growth early this year, which we had already incorporated in our forecasts. And although the IMF attributed this slowdown in the UK to the long-term adverse impact of Brexit starting to show, we think it instead reflects the (temporary) impact of the lower pound on consumers. Indeed, our forecast for GDP growth in 2018 of 2.2% is significantly higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of 1.5%...</p> <p>Our forecasts for the major emerging economies differ significantly from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our view is that GDP growth in both China and India will be 6.0% this year, which is slower than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts of 6.8% and downwardly-revised 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, we expect the recoveries in Brazil and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies to be stronger than the IMF expects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59dce010e4b0c8da8831d8b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-10T15:02:20.149Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts suggest the global economy could be getting back to normal after the battering it received during the financial crisis, suggests Aviva Investors. </strong>Senior economist Stewart Robertson said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After five years (2013-2017 inclusive) when the IMF routinely revised its global growth expectations lower, they have for the second time in a row revised it higher for the year ahead. The differences may be quite small, but the fact they are in a positive direction is news in itself. Having got used to regular disappointments, successive growth upgrades are an indication that things are perhaps changing in a good way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the economic expansion has become more entrenched. Solid foundations now provide a sound base for ongoing growth and slow normalisation after ten-years of doubt and setback.</p> <p>At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in Washington the IMF was keen to highlight that growth outcomes in the first half of 2017 were stronger than expected and also that the continuing economic recovery had become more broad-based. This being the IMF, however, it was not all good news. It was noticeable that compared to as recently as July, the UK was the only major developed nation <em>not</em> to receive an upward growth revision. The reasons for this are well-documented, largely the result of weaker consumer spending. Looking further ahead, the IMF referred to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd medium-term outlook, a direct consequence of Brexit. The last time that Britain was such a notable underperformer was in the dark days of the 1970s. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope it is cyclical this time, not structural.</p> <p>The IMF also stressed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the recovery is not complete\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a strange choice of phrase, suggesting that there is a standard template for economic revivals. As any student of economic history will tell you, they are all different. Variations on a theme perhaps, but this one especially is treading a great deal of new ground. The themes that the IMF chooses to draw special attention to in advanced nations are below-target inflation in several countries and weak productivity growth and rising old-age dependency. We believe that global inflation will return gradually as long as growth continues, but recognise that the longer-term supply-side issues will be an enduring challenge for the decades to come.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59dcdeede4b0c8da8831d8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-10T14:57:13.133Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from Ireland:</p> <blockquote> <p>There were two new initiatives in the Irish budget prompted by concerns over public health.</p> <p>First, a Sugar Tax of 30 cents per litre on soft drinks which have between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres in them.</p> <p>The Irish Heart Foundation described the imposition of the tax as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark day in the fight against obesity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Sunbeds and tanning salons have been hit with extra VAT charges rising from 13.5 per cent to 23 per cent.

                "bodyText":"A rise in banking shares helped lift the FTSE 100 to a two month high, with brokers saying they should benefit from a soft Brexit. Better than expected industrial production figures helped outweigh a jump in the UK trade deficit. But European markets edged lower on uncertainty ahead of the Catalan parliament discussing independence. (Our live blog on the meeting is here.)

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The IMF predictions are too pessimistic for the UK and too optimistic for China and India, says Nikita Shah at Capital Economics, who is also more optimistic about a fiscal stimulus in the US next year: The Fund dropped its assumption of a fiscal expansion taking place [in the US], due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant policy uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We think that Congress will pass a small fiscal stimulus early next year and that this will help to boost US GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018, a touch higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of 2.3%. [On the UK] the headlines focussed on the 0.3pps downgrade to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 UK growth forecast from its projection in April. But this was partly due to the Fund catching up with weaker-than-expected growth early this year, which we had already incorporated in our forecasts. And although the IMF attributed this slowdown in the UK to the long-term adverse impact of Brexit starting to show, we think it instead reflects the (temporary) impact of the lower pound on consumers. Indeed, our forecast for GDP growth in 2018 of 2.2% is significantly higher than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of 1.5%... Our forecasts for the major emerging economies differ significantly from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our view is that GDP growth in both China and India will be 6.0% this year, which is slower than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts of 6.8% and downwardly-revised 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, we expect the recoveries in Brazil and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies to be stronger than the IMF expects. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts suggest the global economy could be getting back to normal after the battering it received during the financial crisis, suggests Aviva Investors. Senior economist Stewart Robertson said: After five years (2013-2017 inclusive) when the IMF routinely revised its global growth expectations lower, they have for the second time in a row revised it higher for the year ahead. The differences may be quite small, but the fact they are in a positive direction is news in itself. Having got used to regular disappointments, successive growth upgrades are an indication that things are perhaps changing in a good way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the economic expansion has become more entrenched. Solid foundations now provide a sound base for ongoing growth and slow normalisation after ten-years of doubt and setback. At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in Washington the IMF was keen to highlight that growth outcomes in the first half of 2017 were stronger than expected and also that the continuing economic recovery had become more broad-based. This being the IMF, however, it was not all good news. It was noticeable that compared to as recently as July, the UK was the only major developed nation not to receive an upward growth revision. The reasons for this are well-documented, largely the result of weaker consumer spending. Looking further ahead, the IMF referred to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd medium-term outlook, a direct consequence of Brexit. The last time that Britain was such a notable underperformer was in the dark days of the 1970s. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope it is cyclical this time, not structural. The IMF also stressed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the recovery is not complete\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a strange choice of phrase, suggesting that there is a standard template for economic revivals. As any student of economic history will tell you, they are all different. Variations on a theme perhaps, but this one especially is treading a great deal of new ground. The themes that the IMF chooses to draw special attention to in advanced nations are below-target inflation in several countries and weak productivity growth and rising old-age dependency. We believe that global inflation will return gradually as long as growth continues, but recognise that the longer-term supply-side issues will be an enduring challenge for the decades to come. More from Ireland: There were two new initiatives in the Irish budget prompted by concerns over public health. First, a Sugar Tax of 30 cents per litre on soft drinks which have between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres in them. The Irish Heart Foundation described the imposition of the tax as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark day in the fight against obesity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunbeds and tanning salons have been hit with extra VAT charges rising from 13.5 per cent to 23 per cent. The Irish government said this was in line with its National Cancer Strategy to reduce cancer particular of the skin. It is the most common form of cancer in Ireland. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts have had little impact on the markets, reckons Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: [The IMF} was relatively upbeat this Tuesday, stating that the world economy should grow by 3.7% in 2017, up from 3.2% in 2016, while maintaining those levels in 2018. However, the IMF wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so positive about the UK, stating it was an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexception\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the overall chirpy outlook due to the uncertainty of Brexit, and the subsequent impact on wages and household spending. Yet...none of this made too much difference to investors. Cable continued to chug along with a 0.3% to 0.4% rise, while sterling dipped 0.1% to 0.2% against the euro. The FTSE rode the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconsistent performance to a 20 point increase, while the DAX and CAC fell 0.4% and 0.2% respectively off the back of the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half a percent jump against the dollar (a move that was already in place before the IMF upgraded the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts). Market-wise the biggest news was probably that the Dow Jones hit a fresh all-time high. But even this was pretty lame, the index briefly spiking to 22850 before settling back below 22800. More on the Irish budget. Henry McDonald writes: Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget for 2018 has included some extra measures to help smaller and medium businesses cope with the impact of Brexit. Paschal Donohoe, Irish Finance Minister, has announced a Brexit Loan Scheme for the small business sector in the Republic. SME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employ 69 per cent of the Irish workforce. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25m is being set aside to help small businesses in the agri-food sector. The body that promotes trade across the Irish Sea has welcomed the loan scheme. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce said the loan scheme would give the SME sector \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the means to adequately prepare for Brexit [and] is vital as part of our national effort to mitigate the negative impacts of Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another major headline figure in the budget has been a promised \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.8bn for housing. There has been massive pressure on the Fine Gael minority government to start building more public housing in response to rising rents, soaring mortgage costs and the fact that there are 3,000 children currently living in emergency accommodation in Dublin. He is asked about his first impressions of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plans, and if he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer that, could he say what would be an appropriate plan? Obstfeld says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we on the second impression at least?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t indeed answer the first part of the question. He says there is a lot yet to be determined in the tax plan, people might think it is just detail but it is quite crucial to how the thing will work and what deficit or surplus in the government budget it will lead to. As a general priniple, he says, simplification is a good thing; if it brings a sharp reduction in exemptions, loopholes, special giveaways allowing a reduction in rates, that is a good thing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are increasingly aware that tax systems have to be cogniscent of how they affect inequality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They need to be attuned to the needs of the middle class and those below the median. What happens with government revenues is important as well, do you invest in infrastructure, people. Where the US is, he adds, we feel that whatever the tax reform plan, it should not increase the deficit, tax reform should be revenue enhancing. The US could usefully use more revenue. And the press conference ends. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Elliott asks about the risks to the outlook that the IMF has identified, and says the financial markets do not seem to be taking these on board. Are the markets being irrationally exhuberant? Obstfeld jokes that it is fitting that Richard Thaler won the economics Nobel prize yesterday ( irrationality being one of his themes) although he adds \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he wan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the irrational exhuberance guy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (that was of course Alan Greenspan.) He adds, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is always difficult to determine what a fair asset price is in a rigorous way [but] when you view a number of indices at historic highs, you have to wonder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To some degree [markets] are supported by low interest rates, and growth expectations which could be disappointed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer term growth rates, especially in advanced economies, could see a slowdown, and if interest rates rise more quickly than expected, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an abrupt repricing [of assets] which could be disruptive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are not ready to make a judgement that assets are overpriced. he adds, but we are ready to say there are risks and there could be a downward adjustment. The IMF is asked about the effects of the recent hurricanes and tropical storms. Obstfeld says they will obviously have a big impact on the regional outlook, less so on the global outlook. He says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We stand ready with our rapid financing facility if that is needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Going forward, if some events become more routine - with theories as to why, some linked to climate change - the international community has to think about what kind of support it can give to communities...the suffering is quite grave. Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 55 points or 0.25%. On the US: The IMF is asked by a Portuguese journalist about the situation in Catalonia. Obstfeld says the situation in Spain is concerning, there is a lot of uncertainty, and we can only hope the parties do not act precipitously [but] negotiate. There are a lot of potential gains on both sides if they do settle. There would probably be spillovers [from the Catalonia situation] to Portugal and other countries in Europe. The IMF are now taking questions on the world economic outlook. The panel is asked about Brexit, and the impact on the UK and European economies if no deal is agreed? Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We very much hope negotiations can be constructive and minimise the costs to both sides.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the clock is short, he added, especially as whatever deal there is has to be approved by the 27 members of the EU. He said Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Florence was very constructive, when she suggested a two year transition period. That could be a good thing, he said, if it allows more time for adjustments, given there is a clear process in getting to the end point. And here is Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of the IMF report: Ahead of its annual meeting in Washington later this week, the International Monetary Fund has issued its latest update on the global economy. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent recovery may not last, despite a pickup in activity in all western countries except the UK. Marking the 10th anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, the IMF said there was a risk that governments could be lulled into a false sense of security by booming markets and policymakers needed to guard against complacency. The Washington-based fund said in its half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) that global output growth would increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% this year and 3.7% in 2018. It upgraded its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for this year and next from the last full WEO in April and the update to its forecasts in July. The full story is here: If NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate is right, the UK economy probably grew slower than the rest of Europe, for the third quarter in a row. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy probably grew by 0.4% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest monthly forecasts from the NIESR thinktank. If NIESR are right, that means the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has picked up a little, from 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017. Any increase in growth is welcome, but this would still be below the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent trend growth. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, explains: Although economic growth is likely to be a touch stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when real GDP growth in other major economies such as the Euro Area and the USA has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. Kara adds that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong chance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that UK interest rates will be increased in November, if next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows that inflation has risen and the labour market is still strong. Over in parliament, business minister Claire Perry has told MPs that the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stands ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help BAE Systems workers. Perry said the government would work to avoid compulsory redundancies at the company (but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving much detail about how, exactly). She is being criticised by opposition MPs for not supporting the company. In response, Perry denied that UK defence spending changes were responsible for the 2,000 job cuts announced today. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no lack of productivity at the OBR, though. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created a handy little video on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems: Over in Ireland, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no bonanza\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no fireworks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Speaking before a pre-budget cabinet meeting this Tuesday morning, Varadkar the latest financial measures would mark another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small sustainable step in the right direction for our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, is expected to announce modest tax cuts for middle income earners in Ireland of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 per year. Donohoe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget has been backed by the Independent Alliance and the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. Fianna Fail operates a similar policy of confidence and supply to the Fine Gael minority government that the Democratic Unionist Party uses to keep Theresa May and the Tories in power. The highlights the budget for 2018 in Ireland are expected to be: A rise in the Irish minimum wage by 30 cents to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.55 per hour. A hike in stamp duty tax on commercial property sales by 5 per cent which could raise up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m for the Irish Exchequer. Tax cuts including the slashing of the Universal Social Charge that was imposed on Ireland by the IMF and ECB when the country was bailed out of national bankruptcy. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 million allocated to the farming sector to help farmers with the fall out from Brexit. A sugar tax will be imposed but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be implemented until April next year. Fifty cents put onto a packet of twenty cigarettes, bringing the price to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11 for the first time. No rises in the price of alcoholic drinks. The solution to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problem must include raising skills levels among the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity headache is a self-inflicted wound. Years of cuts, low public investment, and rising job insecurity have taken a heavy toll. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to return to the drawing board. Our yawning productivity gap is holding our economy back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Brexit fast approaching, we urgently need to create more highly-skilled jobs. And improve workforce training and engagement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Making predictions is very difficult, especially about the future, as the old saying has it. The OBR doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away from this either. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows how it has been too optimistic about UK growth and business investment, and also expected interest rates to be rather higher today. Heads-up: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just posted a new version of the UK trade data chart (in the 9.58am post) showing how imports hit a record high in August. You might need to refresh to see it. The OBR says there are several reasons why UK productivity growth has been so disappointing. 1) Firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spending enough on new equipment and infrastructure. Business investment today is just 5 per cent above its pre-crisis peak almost a decade ago, compared to 63% after the 1980s recession. 2) Zombie firms are clinging onto life. Record low interest rates mean that companies who would normally have gone bust are still operating, but not contributing much. 3) Brexit uncertainty is making bosses cautious. OK, this only explains recent productivity problems, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that companies are choosing to hire workers, who can be laid off easily, rather than investing in new capital. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end result: Lower productivity = lower economic growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility has announced that it expects to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd downgrade its estimates of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential productivity growth. The fiscal watchdog, which is independent of the government, has admitted that it has been too optimistic over productivity for many years. It now plans to make amends at the next budget, in November. This is a serious blow to chancellor Philip Hammond - weak productivity means slower growth, and thus erodes the size of his war chest to help the UK economy. In a new report, the OBR points out that productivity has lagged its forecasts since 2010, while employment and average hours worked have both exceeded forecasts. The OBR says : While we continue to believe that there will be some recovery from the very weak productivity performance of recent years, the continued disappointing outturns, together with the likelihood that heightened uncertainty will continue to weigh on investment, means that we anticipate significantly reducing our assumption for potential productivity growth over the next five years in our forthcoming November 2017 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So why is UK productivity so bad, and what did the OBR get wrong? The watchdog says it had expected productivity rise as firms stopped \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchoarding labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after the financial crisis and invested in new machinery instead. It also hoped that it would pick up once banks were strong enough to lend more to the real economy. But this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened.... In a blow to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing base, arms manufacturer BAE has announced plans to cut almost 2,000 jobs. The axe will fall heavily on BAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories in Lancashire, including its site at Warton on the outskirts of Preston. The company is blaming a decline in orders for its Eurofighter Typhoon. It has also suffered from public sector spending cuts since the financial crisis. Unions are urging the government to help the company by committing to new orders soon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade, industrial production and construction data paint a mixed picture of the UK economy, says Kate Davies of the Office for National Statistics. You can see the UK trade data yourself, here. The Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political editor is also struck by the rise in EU exports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures are no better if you strip out \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 elements, such as trade in gold, precious stones and aircraft, and oil. In better news, UK manufacturing output rose by 0.4% in August, better than expected. That means British factories have enjoyed their best quarter of growth since February. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders also had a better month; construction output rose by 0.65 in August, the first increased since May. This may encourage the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates next month. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial Production rose by 0.9% in the three months to August, with the largest contribution coming from manufacturing. Construction output also picked up slightly in August, boosted by infrastructure and private house building. These figures will feed into the first estimate of Q3 GDP, ahead of the next MPC meeting in November. A majority on the MPC appear committed to a rate hike at that meeting, which is now 80% priced in by the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour MP Stephen Doughty says the widening of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alarming news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and shows the dangers of leaving the EU single market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were repeatedly told that crashing the pound would result in a major boost for British exports. But 15 months on we are still waiting, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world continues to widen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures only serve to underline how reckless it is for the Government to be wrenching the UK out of the Single Market, our largest export market right on our doorstep, in pursuit of fantasy trade deals on the other side of the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is from Andy Bruce of Reuters: Brexit didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the UK expanding its exports to other European countries over the last three months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Britain sold an extra \u00c2\u00a31.7bn of goods to the EU in June-August, but suffered a drop in sales to the rest of the world. The ONS says: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00c2\u00a34.0 billion (8.8%) between the three months to May 2017 and the three months to August 2017. As shown in Figure 2, almost half was due to a decrease in fuel exports (\u00c2\u00a31.9 billion). Exports of goods to the EU increased by \u00c2\u00a31.7 billion (4.1%) between the three months to May 2017 and the three months to August 2017, due to machinery and transport equipment exports increasing by \u00c2\u00a30.8 billion, and smaller increases elsewhere. In total, the UK exported \u00c2\u00a342.7bn of goods to the EU in June, July and August, and imported \u00c2\u00a366.6bn. The widening of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit last month is a disappointment, says Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Thiru writes: Taken together with the recent widening of the current account deficit, the figures paint a rather gloomy picture of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external position. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest trade data is further evidence that the decline in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value over the past year is doing little to boost the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall trade position. Businesses continue to report that the post-EU referendum weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with firms continuing to face higher input costs due to the weakening currency, particularly those locked into global supply chains. For those companies that rely on overseas suppliers for their production equipment, a weak pound also makes investment in growth less viable. As Ben Chu of the Independent points out, the drop in the pound last year hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revitalised Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports of goods from the EU hit a record high last month. The UK imported \u00c2\u00a322bn of physical items from Europe in August, but only exported \u00c2\u00a314bn, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. That highlights the importance of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to the rest of Europe. Brexit supporters will argue that this should help Theresa May cut a good trade deal..... But the UK also imported \u00c2\u00a319bn of goods from outside the EU -- which is also a record high -- while exporting \u00c2\u00a313.8bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall goods deficit hit a record high last month, as this chart shows: Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world has hit a record high. The gap between what the UK bought and sold widened to \u00c2\u00a314.245 in August, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much bigger than expected, and up from \u00c2\u00a312.8bn in July. Imports surged by 4.2% during the month, due to higher imports of chemicals, machinery and textiles. Exports, though, only rose by 0.7% during the month. Despite a surplus in services trade, the overall UK trade deficit has now widened to \u00c2\u00a35.626bn, the biggest reading in 12 months. Over the last three months, the total UK trade deficit in goods and services widened by \u00c2\u00a32.9 billion to \u00c2\u00a310.8 billion. More to follow. The pound is creeping higher in early trading, gaining 0.4 of a cent to almost $1.319. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since last Wednesday, when Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnightmare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party conference speech sparked speculation over her future. Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza shares are having a sizzling morning, jumping almost 11% in early trading and outperforming the rest of the London market. Traders are pleased that it is pressing on with 90 new UK store openings this year, despite warning that British consumers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sales across the fast food group jumped by 20% in the last quarter, with UK online sales also strong. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is fighting off rising competition: Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a cash generative business model and significant potential to add new stores in the UK and overseas. Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are winning market share in the pizza delivery sector, not least due to the strength of their online ordering platform, which saw online sales in the UK rise 17.4%. In Q3, Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turned up the marketing heat, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dine for \u00c2\u00a39.99\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offer and customers responded strongly, despite increasing competition in the online food delivery sector from Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Elsewhere, after a mixed session in Asia, European stock markets are pretty flat. The FTSE 100 has inched up a bit, but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX has lost 0.4% amid Catalonian worries. Economics blogger Jeroen Blokland is impressed by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German trade figures: Just in: French industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, by 0.3% Manufacturing output dropped too, by 0.4%. Economists had expected industrial output to have risen by 0.4%, so this indicates that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may have softened a little last summer. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has widened again, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to enjoy a good year. New figures released this morning show that seasonally adjusted exports rose by 3.1% in August, the biggest rise in a year, while imports only rose by 1.2%. That shows that the stronger euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t preventing German firms from racking up new business. It pushed the German trade surplus up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21.6bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.3bn in July. On an annual basis, exports were 7.2% higher than a year ago: Whil Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK trade is on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind right now, with the Brexit negotiations struggling to make meaningful progress and the risks of no deal rising. So economists will be poring over the latest trade figures, due this morning, to see what shape Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in. The City predicts that Britain ran up a trade deficit of around \u00c2\u00a32.8bn, close to the \u00c2\u00a32.87bn incurred in July. That is due to an estimated trade on goods deficit of around \u00c2\u00a311.2bn, as Britain continued to buy in much more stuff than she produces. But this will probably be partially balanced by the service sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional surplus. The figures will also show how dependent Britain was on imports and exports with the European Union. Recent figures have shown that UK exports to the EU have risen since the referendum, while the deficit with the rest of the world has dropped. That could change, though, if new restrictions are imposed on trade across the Channel from 2019 if a transition deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed (as the government warned yesterday). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tweet from a month ago, showing the situation in July: The ONS will also report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector fared in August. Industrial production is expected to grow by 0.2% during the month, as the weaker pound helped factories to sell their wares (and pushed up the cost of imported raw materials). New industrial production reports from across the eurozone will give an international comparison.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems will also come under the microscope today, when the the Office for Budget Responsibility publishes its annual forecast evaluation report. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog will probably admit that it has overestimated UK productivity growth for several years, which means the economy is in worse shape than we thought. That will be followed by a new estimate of how fast (or slow?) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew in the last three months. The NIESR thinktank is expected to estimate growth of around 0.3% in July-September. Then, the International Monetary Fund issues its own healthcheck on the global economy, the World Economic Outlook, at 2pm BS (9am in Washington). This will show the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest growth forecasts, and also highlight the key risks that could spark a downturn, or even a new financial crisis. Elsewhere, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BAE Systems may announce sweeping job cuts at its aerospace and naval servicing operation today. On the corporate side, Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza has reported another quarter of growth, up 12% in the UK. European stock markets look quiet, with the FTSE 100 expected to drop by just 6 points at the open to 7501. Traders will be watching Spain closely, where the President of Catalonia will address the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament later today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30: Office for National Statistics publishes UK trade, industrial production and construction output data for August 11am: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office For Budget Responsibility releases its latest Forecast evaluation report, showing how its forecasts compared with reality. 1pm: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates UK growth in the last three months. 1pm: Ireland presents its 2018 budget 2pm: International Monetary Fund releases the latest World Economic Outlook",

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been the busiest day in global markets, despite further developments in the Spain/Catalonia situation. A lack of heavy data and earnings has characterised the week thus far, although with US banks on the calendar for the next two days that is about to change.</p> <p>Weakness throughout the morning was replaced by small gains, as the Spanish response to the Catalan (sort of) declaration of independence came in the form of a gentle, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccould you possibly clarify that?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from prime minister Rajoy.</p> <p>Catalonia now apparently exists in a state of limbo, having declared and then suspended its independence, while Spain has said it might think about activating Article 155. The irresistible force has met the immovable object, and stalemate has resulted. The lack of any drama has meant that, outside the Ibex, the market reaction has been limited.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59de3469e4b0d247a08b9be3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-11T15:12:31.939Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the rise in the Japanese stock market, and this may not be the end of it, according to Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a two decade high but we think it has further to run. The economy is picking up, corporate profits are being upgraded and the central bank is on the side of equity holders - unusually they have pledged to overshoot their inflation target of 2% and are keeping policy very loose until they get there.</p> <p>This policy commitment makes Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market a useful hedge against possible losses on bond portfolios if US interest rates continue to rise as we expect. Japanese long term rates are pinned down close to zero. Whenever US bonds sell off, widening interest rate differentials weaken the yen and boost the export-oriented Nikkei.</p> <p>It is for this reason that I have been overweight Japanese equities in multi asset funds but underweight the yen since this element of Abenomics was first announced. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the snap election to change things for the worse. If anything, an opposition win could result in the abandonment of planned sales tax rises, resulting in even looser fiscal policy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59de307fe4b014d93a1be128\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-11T15:01:17.161Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Global central banks have begun to start switching off the money taps which have been supporting the world economy and stock markets since the financial crisis.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates, with another increase possible before the year end. The Bank of England is hinting at a rise in November despite an uninspiring UK economic performance, and the European Central Bank is looking at tapering its bond buying programme.</p> <p>So could these moves disrupt the global recovery? Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Vicky Redwood says perhaps not:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect global growth to slow only modestly as the era of easy money starts drawing to a close. The monetary tightening is set to be gradual, limited and staggered, with some countries only starting to tighten as others are finishing. And the relationship between interest rates and GDP growth has generally been weak. But with debt still high, the world economy would struggle with a much bigger tightening. </p> <p>The backdrop to this tightening is a reassuring combination of faster economic growth and low inflation. The world economy was only hit hard before when rates were raised abruptly to dampen high inflation. And although reversing quantitative easing is an added complication this time, central banks have already taken key steps along the path of monetary tightening with little effect on the economy or the markets. </p> <p>What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the tightening should be gradual. It is unlikely to be closely synchronised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we expect a gap of over three years between the first rises in US and euro-zone interest rates. And it need not be that big; neutral interest rates have fallen and central bank balance sheets are unlikely to return to pre- crisis levels. We think that, at most, half of the post-crisis loosening in monetary policy will get reversed</p> </blockquote> <p>But there are risks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even a gradual approach to tightening may prove to be too much if demand is more fragile, or markets more nervy, than we think. And if central banks need to back-track, they have limited ammunition with which to loosen policy again. The gradual approach also risks inflating asset bubbles further, storing up trouble for the future.</p> <p>There is also a risk that a slow tightening simply turns out to be infeasible if inflation takes off, leading policymakers to tighten policy more rapidly than they have signalled. With debt to income ratios still high, and saving ratios low, a sharp rise in interest rates would make us significantly more worried. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59de2b57e4b014d93a1be110\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-11T14:35:36.647Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opec lifts oil demand forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elsewhere Opec, the organisation of petroleum exporting countries, has forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018.</p> <p>In its monthly report it said the world would need 33.06m barrels a day of its crude next year, up 230,000 barrels from its previous forecast.

                "bodyText":"Spain ended as the standout performer among European markets, despite the uncertainty over the standoff between Madrid and the Catalan independence seekers. At the very least, the demand for clarification over the independence situation meant the immediate tensions have been defused. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The stalemate between the region and the Spanish government is still ongoing, but the news that the region isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rushing for the exit has lifted investor confidence. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any clarity as to how the situation will develop from here, but at least the market can be confident of political stability in the country. Dealers may become nervous again when the separatists try and pursue their agenda, but at the moment normality has returned to the Spanish market. Overall in Europe, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.06% or 4.46 points at 7533.81, but it is still just 14 points or so below its closing peak Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.17% to 12,970.68 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.02% at 5362.41 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.97% to 22,552.21 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 10,278.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.85% to 748.61 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 21 points or 0.09%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Despite the rally in Japanese and Spanish stock markets, it has been fairly lacklustre elsewhere. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been the busiest day in global markets, despite further developments in the Spain/Catalonia situation. A lack of heavy data and earnings has characterised the week thus far, although with US banks on the calendar for the next two days that is about to change. Weakness throughout the morning was replaced by small gains, as the Spanish response to the Catalan (sort of) declaration of independence came in the form of a gentle, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccould you possibly clarify that?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from prime minister Rajoy. Catalonia now apparently exists in a state of limbo, having declared and then suspended its independence, while Spain has said it might think about activating Article 155. The irresistible force has met the immovable object, and stalemate has resulted. The lack of any drama has meant that, outside the Ibex, the market reaction has been limited. Back with the rise in the Japanese stock market, and this may not be the end of it, according to Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management. He says: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a two decade high but we think it has further to run. The economy is picking up, corporate profits are being upgraded and the central bank is on the side of equity holders - unusually they have pledged to overshoot their inflation target of 2% and are keeping policy very loose until they get there. This policy commitment makes Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market a useful hedge against possible losses on bond portfolios if US interest rates continue to rise as we expect. Japanese long term rates are pinned down close to zero. Whenever US bonds sell off, widening interest rate differentials weaken the yen and boost the export-oriented Nikkei. It is for this reason that I have been overweight Japanese equities in multi asset funds but underweight the yen since this element of Abenomics was first announced. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the snap election to change things for the worse. If anything, an opposition win could result in the abandonment of planned sales tax rises, resulting in even looser fiscal policy. Global central banks have begun to start switching off the money taps which have been supporting the world economy and stock markets since the financial crisis. The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates, with another increase possible before the year end. The Bank of England is hinting at a rise in November despite an uninspiring UK economic performance, and the European Central Bank is looking at tapering its bond buying programme. So could these moves disrupt the global recovery? Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Vicky Redwood says perhaps not: We expect global growth to slow only modestly as the era of easy money starts drawing to a close. The monetary tightening is set to be gradual, limited and staggered, with some countries only starting to tighten as others are finishing. And the relationship between interest rates and GDP growth has generally been weak. But with debt still high, the world economy would struggle with a much bigger tightening. The backdrop to this tightening is a reassuring combination of faster economic growth and low inflation. The world economy was only hit hard before when rates were raised abruptly to dampen high inflation. And although reversing quantitative easing is an added complication this time, central banks have already taken key steps along the path of monetary tightening with little effect on the economy or the markets. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the tightening should be gradual. It is unlikely to be closely synchronised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we expect a gap of over three years between the first rises in US and euro-zone interest rates. And it need not be that big; neutral interest rates have fallen and central bank balance sheets are unlikely to return to pre- crisis levels. We think that, at most, half of the post-crisis loosening in monetary policy will get reversed But there are risks: Even a gradual approach to tightening may prove to be too much if demand is more fragile, or markets more nervy, than we think. And if central banks need to back-track, they have limited ammunition with which to loosen policy again. The gradual approach also risks inflating asset bubbles further, storing up trouble for the future. There is also a risk that a slow tightening simply turns out to be infeasible if inflation takes off, leading policymakers to tighten policy more rapidly than they have signalled. With debt to income ratios still high, and saving ratios low, a sharp rise in interest rates would make us significantly more worried. Elsewhere Opec, the organisation of petroleum exporting countries, has forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018. In its monthly report it said the world would need 33.06m barrels a day of its crude next year, up 230,000 barrels from its previous forecast. It suggested that its agreement to curb output was helping to get rid of a supply glut. But it does not expect prices to surge, forecasting that crude will remain between $50 and $55 a barrel in the next year. Brent crude is currently down 0.11% at $56.55. Q: Is there a tax rate above which it would be counter-productive to tax the rich?* The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vitor Gaspar says the IMF hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to any conclusions on this. But, since the 1970s, tax rates on the wealthy have fallen steadily, and the Fund believes there is scope to raise them without damaging growth, he reiterates. * - this question was most famously tackled by economist Arthur Laffer, on the back of a napkin, showing that raising taxes too high can actually result in lower revenues: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very popular with economists and politicians who favour tax cuts - the problem, though, is knowing where you are on the curve in the first place.. Surely no-one can argue with this chart?.... The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about inequality might grate with readers in Greece, for example, where years of austerity have driven millions deeper into poverty. Nadia Daar, who runs Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Washington DC, hopes that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warm words will actually translate into action: Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Director of Fiscal Affairs, is taking questions now. He says improving heathcare provisions for the poor would help tackle inequality. Asked about the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on taxation, Gaspar says that back in 1981 the average top marginal rate was 62%. That has fallen to 35% now. He says the Fund is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agnostic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about whether countries will want to tax their higher earners more. But it also believes that countries should put inclusive growth at the top of their agenda. The IMF is concerned that inequality has risen in more than half the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s countries in the last three decades. That includes three major nations - China, India and the United States. - even though inequality has declined across the globe. These rises in inequality can hurt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social cohesion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, lead to political polarization, and ultimately lower economic growth, the Fund warns. Some countries have experienced a reduction in inequality while others, particularly advanced economies, have seen a significant increase that has, among other things, contributed to growing public backlash against globalization. The IMF are presenting the details of their Fiscal Monitor in Washington now - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund is calling on governments to consider tackle inequality by raising taxes on the rich. In its latest Fiscal Monitor report, just released, the Fund argues that taxing top earners more would not have an adverse impact on growth. Indeed, it says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progressive taxation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and fiscal transfers can be key components of a strategy to redistribute wealth more fairly. These conclusions appear to support centre-left parties who push for higher taxes on the wealthiest, but are a rebuke to the right-wing argument that cutting taxes for top earners will trickle-down through the income layers. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: In an analysis certain to be seized on by Labour as backing for its tax strategy, the IMF used its influential half-yearly fiscal monitor to attack the rationale for the reductions in tax for the highest earners in recent decades. The IMF said tax theory suggested there should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly higher\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax rates for those on higher incomes but the argument against doing so was that hitting the rich would be bad for growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Empirical results do not support this argument, at least for levels of progressivity that are not excessive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the IMF said, adding that different types of wealth taxes might also be considered. The fiscal monitor does not mention any country by name, but the thrust of the report suggests it has doubts about the pro-rich tax plan proposed by Donald Trump for the US. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: David Lipton, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy managing director, sums up the challenge facing politicians and central bank chiefs -- tackle risks, while avoiding a crash. The International Monetary Fund has sounded a new warning that the good times in the global economy may not last. In its new Global Financial Stability Report, the Fund points its finger at the rising debt piles across advanced and emerging economies. It fears that the increased risk appetite and the ongoing search for yield means investors could be too reckless, with dangerous consequences. Tobias Adrian, of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability watchdog, warns this complacency could be creating financial excesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the waters seem calm, vulnerabilities are building under the surface [and] if left unattended, these could derail the global recovery. The IMF singled out Australia, Canada and China as being three countries where households and businesses have taken on more debt, potentially putting them at risk if there is a new financial crisis. Over in Westminster, the Unite trade union have held a protest urging the government to do more to protect Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Those jobs are threatened by the 220% tariff which the US government is imposing on Bombardier planes sold to Delta Airlines, following a complaint by Boeing that its Canadian rival was getting unfair subsidies. Several MPs took part in the demonstration too (Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey is in the middle, in front of shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner). The preliminary decision to impose tariffs on Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C-Series jets has been widely criticised (Boeing faces particular stick, as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manufacture a similar jet anyway). Gardiner gave Boeing a rollicking on Bloomberg TV this morning, calling the US planemaker a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubsidy junkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcking of corporate welfare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The government has also criticised Boeing, saying it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to see such behaviour from a partner. Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the US company has put up some adverts for MPs to admire on the way to and from parliament. CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Santoli suggests Donald Trump shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t demand too much credit for the US stock market rally. After all, shares rallied just as strongly in the 11 months after Barack Obama was re-elected to the White House in 2012. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begin with much of a rally, though, as the markets were still tumbling as the world economy entered recession. US president Donald Trump is unhappy that the media aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving more coverage to the stock market rally (maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not reading the right liveblogs.....) He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted that the US stock market has gained over $5 trillion since he won last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that the Trump Rally (if we must call it that) is impressive, with the Dow Jones industrial average up around 25% in the last 11 months. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that this proves the need for tax cuts (which, experts point out, will mainly benefit the very richest in America). Actually, the rally is partly due to predictions that Trump will make it easier for firms to repatriate funds that are currently parked overseas. That money might then be handed to shareholders in dividends, or used to buy back shares. Not very good for growth, but a boost for share prices.... Sam Jones, our correspondent in Barcelona, says Mariano Rajoy has just put the ball back in Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side of the court in the independence crisis. He writes: Rajoy, who has refused to rule out invoking article 155 of the Spanish constitution to take control of Catalonia, was quick to seize on the ambiguity of [Catalan president] Puigdemont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, accusing him of deliberately sowing confusion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cabinet has agreed this morning to formally require the Catalan government to confirm whether it has declared independence after the deliberate confusion created over whether it has come into effect,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a television address on Wednesday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Back in Madrid, prime minister Mariano Rajoy has demanded full clarity over the Catalonian president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement yesterday that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuspended independence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Rajoy says he needs to know whether the region has formerly declared a breakaway, and hinted that the region could lose its existing powers if it has. Assocated Press has the details: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy demanded on Wednesday that the Catalan leader clarify whether he has declared independence, issuing a veiled threat that the central government could limit or rescind the province\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autonomy if he has. He said the Catalan government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response would be crucial in deciding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153events over the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is the first time that Rajoy has openly said that Article 155 of the Spanish constitution will be the next step taken by the government if Catalan authorities don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t backtrack. He said the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wants to offer certainty to citizens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153necessary to return tranquility and calm.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is now pushing higher, sending the IBEX up 1.5% today to 10,299 points. That keeps world stocks at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder and chairman of Cobra Beer, is worried about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outcome from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiations. This option re-emerged from the fog of Brexit yesterday, when prime minister Theresa May told MPs that it was possible that Britain might not reach an agreement with Brussels over its future arrangement. Bilimoria says it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blow to companies such as Cobra (a favourite tipple at many Indian restaurants) and the wider UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No deal would be the worst possible outcome and when the public voted to leave they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the government a blank cheque to leave on any basis whatsoever. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In practical terms it would be very difficult because we export Cobra from Burton on Trent to almost every country in Europe. We manufacture two of our products in Belgium, and import from Belgium into the UK. At the moment it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seamless. If we suddenly have to deal with border controls and checks and the extra cost of import costs both ways, that makes our product less competitive. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be terrible. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, Bilimoria said the sharp fall in the value of the pound - which makes British goods cheaper abroad - since the Brexit vote was not entirely helpful either. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The currency effect helps our exports on the one hand but we as a country are a net importer so the consumer is starting to take a hit. We supply 98.5% of the Indian restaurants in this country. They are taking a hit because a lot of their ingredients are imported so for our export business, yes it helps, but as a country we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re net importers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m proud to be a British manufacturer but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reliant on inward investment. Britain is the largest recipient of inward investment in the whole of Europe and our position at the top table of the world is already hugely diminished already, let alone leaving the European Union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond has been discussing Brexit in front of the Treasury committee this morning. Hammond warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit could leave the EU and the UK unable to share data, and could even mean airlines can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly between the two (although he added that this is an unlikely outcome). The chancellor also floated the risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad-tempered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit, if the two sides don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make progress on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU. But he is also resisting pressure to commit billions in extra spending on new customs controls at the UK borders, until we have more clarity over the future. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has full details: The Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to a 21-year high today has stirred some memories for Nick Leeson, the original Rogue Trader. Leeson swapped a desk at Barings Bank for a cell at Changi Prison after running up a series of losses which he hid from his bosses. The black hole which brought down Barings in 1995 emerged after Leeson wagered that the Nikkei would remain stable on a particular day (by selling put and call options that would deliver a profit if the market stayed calm, but cost him if it rose or fell by much). Unfortunately for Leeson, the Kobe earthquake struck - sending the Nikkei tumbling. He placed a series of increasingly unlikely bets that it would recover, before being uncovered. Leeson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tongue-in-cheek point is that those positions would have turned a profit, eventually. But the scale of his losses actually wiped out Barings capital reserves, ensuring its demise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how we reported it at the time: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katya Adler has the latest from Spain.... Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, agrees that Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to back away from declaring full-blown independence last night has reassured the markets. He says: European markets are looking towards Spain for inspiration, as the decision from Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to delay a declaration of independence has led to a sharp rise in the IBEX and euro. But... the situation does remain fluid. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet will meet later today to discuss the situation, and prime minister Mariano Rajoy is due to speak about the issue soon. Boom! World stock markets have hit a new all time high. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All-World stocks index, which tracks 2,400 companies around the globe, has inched up to 493.31 points this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge to a two-decade closing high in Japan today. The rally in Spanish stocks and bonds this morning is also helping. David Meier, economist at Julius Baer, says the news that Catalonia plans to negotiate with Madrid, rather than immediately trigger independence, is reassuring investors. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This episode could serve as a deterrent for other independence movements in Spain and Europe rather than lead to a rise in break-up risks. Markets rightly maintain their calm. The global market rally also owes a lot to US stocks, which have racked up a string of record highs this year. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained more than 20% since Donald Trump won the US election last November, even though his promises of tax reform and infrastructure spending are still on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTo Do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 list. Relief over Catalonia has also pushed the euro to a two week high, at $1.184 against the US dollar. Spanish bonds are also recovering. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has opened strongly, on relief that Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has backed away from declaring independence. The IBEX jumping over 1% in early trading, with traders welcoming President Carles Puigdemont speech last night in which he pledged to negotiate with Spanish government, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suspend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the independence move Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says investors are hoping that the two sides can hammer out a compromise: A strong sense of relief was felt across financial markets on Tuesday evening, after Catalan leaders signed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symbolic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd declaration of independence, but immediately suspended its formal approval and called for talks with Madrid. Although President Carles Puigdemont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks disappointed many of his ardent supporters, who were hoping for a unilateral declaration of independence, his speech was music to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ears, as this softer approach eased tensions. The Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally comes despite a big scandal enveloping Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest steel maker, Kobe Steel. Kobe has shocked Japan, and beyond, by admitting that it has fabricated data on components used in cars, aircraft and space rockets. The company has sold aluminium and copper products to more than 200 companies, including Boeing, Toyota and Nissan, even though they had failed quality control tests - and falsified data to make it appear that items had passed. The scandal may stretch back a decade, Kobe says, and involved dozens of staff. It risks damaging Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for manufacturing quality. Today, the company revealed that iron powder results were also faked. Kobe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has now plunged by a third since the company came clean on Sunday, and top officials bowed apologetically to reporters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock index has closed at its highest level in over two decades, as optimism over the global economy builds and geopolitical worries ease. Upbeat traders in Tokyo sent the Nikkei 225 index up to 20,881.27, a gain of 57 points or almost 0.3%. It comes after Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones index hit a fresh record high last night, as the bull market rally refuses to fizzle out. There was excitement in Tokyo as trading ended.... The Nikkei, which tracks Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manor companies, is now at levels last seen in December 1996. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong recovery from the depths of the financial crisis (in 2009, the Nikkei suffered an undignified tumble below 8,000 points). Is this proof that you should invest in the stock market for the long term? Not exactly. The Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alltime peak was actually a stratospheric 38,915.87 points, back in December 1989. Someone who bought Japanese shares 30 years ago may still be waiting patiently to break even... But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice landmark, and comes after the International Monetary Fund raised its forecasts for global growth yesterday. Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, say\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mood in the markets again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the biggest drivers of global equities is the United States and some of the macro data coming out from there has been quite positive. There is also this view that China is travelling much better than many people had expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also relief that tensions between the US and North Korea haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t become further inflamed, and that Catalonia has suspended its declaration of independence. This all helped other Asia-Pacific markets to rally today too. New Zealand shares hit their record high for a seventh day running, while Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market hit an eight-week high. European stock markets are expected to follow suit this morning: Also coming up today.... 2pm BST: The International Monetary Fund release its Global Financial Stability Report this afternoon. It will single out dangers to the global economy, and identify solutions to avoid a new financial crisis. 7pm BST: The US Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its monetary policy meeting earlier this month. Wall Street will be looking for hints about whether interest rates will rise in December.",

Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to call this the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max\">Mad Max problem</a>. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed?</p> <p>For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? </p> <p>The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process...</p> <p>To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a <a href=\"https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\">Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index</a>, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"443e9f14a707164845dc678210a040aecb3ad5bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/443e9f14a707164845dc678210a040aecb3ad5bd/0_135_4072_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Atlases Russian Business Forum, Day 2MOSCOW REGION, RUSSIA - OCTOBER 6, 2017: Bitcoin cryptocurrency souvenir coins at the 2017 Atlases Russian Business Forum at the Crocus City Hall.

Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem.</p> <p>One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited.</p> <p>That sounds like a smart idea.

But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic.</p> <p>The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations).</p> <p>In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher....</p> <p>September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy.</p> <p>We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption. After all, the ISM manufacturing index is at a 13 year high, the dollar is making exports more competitive and we are seeing stronger global growth.</p> <p>With overall economic growth looking good, inflation pressures gradually increasing and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about asset valuations and financial stability becoming more prominent in speeches, a December rate hike is looking likely. The main risk remains the potential for an economically/market destabilising government shutdown.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e0b5cf611ed80722884a3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T12:47:51.119Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile US retail sales have bounced back in September, albeit just shy of expectations:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dmadden_CMC/status/918818493558116352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US retail sales MoM (Sep): 1.6% vs 1.7% expected, prior -0.2%<br>US core retail sales MoM (Sep): 0.5% vs 0.4% expected, prior -0.1%</p>&mdash; David Madden (@dmadden_CMC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmadden_CMC/status/918818493558116352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T12:49:11.175Z\">at 1.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59e0b39601a8e6075b954ab4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-13T12:43:12.167Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: inflation across America rose last month, but by less than expected.</strong></p> <p>Consumer prices increased by 0.5% in September, below the 0.6% which Wall Street expected.</p> <p>On an annual basis, US CPI rose by 2.2%, up from 1.9% a month ago.

                "bodyText":"An uncertain day for markets saw the FTSE 100 end lower after hitting a new closing peak on Thursday. A profit warning from GKN did not help, but the index was supported by a rise in mining shares following a surge in Chinese imports. On the other hand, sterling managed to maintain its positive mood against the dollar - with the US currency weakened by disappointing inflation numbers - which in turn undermined the overseas earners in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index. Conversely the more domestic focused FTSE 250 edged higher to another closing peak. In Europe the picture was mixed, while in the US, Wall Street moved higher despite a little uncertainty over a December interest rate rise following the inflation figures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 20.80 points or 0.28% at 7535.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.07% to 12,991.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.17% at 5351.74 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.07% 22,413.54 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.17% lower at 10,258.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 761.35 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Presented without comment: Back with Bitcoin, and a senior economist reckons the cryptocurrency faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mad Max problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Teunis Brosens, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank says: A core element of cryptocurrency is the lack of a central authority. Nodes on the network verify transactions which are rewarded with transaction fees and in the case of bitcoins, newly minted bitcoins go with each verified block of transaction. From the verifying nodes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, these new bitcoins are mined. Hence they are referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ...One of the central issues of cryptocurrencies is trust. How can the rest of the cryptocurrency network trust the verification work done by miners? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to call this the Mad Max problem. In a Mad Max world, with no law enforcement, your base assumption has to be that nobody can be trusted. How to do transactions take place in such a world without anyone getting robbed? For example, malevolent miners could verify blocks of fraudulent transactions in which bitcoin is taken from victims and sent to their own wallets, or where the same bitcoin is spent several times. How do network nodes know that the blocks presented by miners are truly valid? The innovative concept applied by bitcoin is proof-of-work (POW) system. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. Together, they will dominate the verification (mining) process... To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity. In fact, the website Digiconomist has constructed a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, estimating bitcoin energy consumption. And the results are sobering. At the time of writing, verifying one transaction on the bitcoin blockchain consumes about 200kWh. ...The cryptocurrency community is aware of the sheer energy consumption issue. Therefore, it is looking for alternative solutions to the Mad Max problem. One alternative may be Proof of Stake. Miners are not asked to show they put in work (computing power) in validating but to commit valuable resources beforehand, indicating they have a stake in the proper outcome. For example, miners may have to put an amount of cryptocurrency in escrow which is only released if no fraud is detected, otherwise forfeited. That sounds like a smart idea. However, it implies that only those wealthy enough to be able to put resources in escrow can join the mining process. This creates a plutocracy, which sits uncomfortably with cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anarchistic and libertarian roots. My conclusion is that finding a sustainable and fair solution to the Mad Max Problem is one of the biggest challenges for the cryptocurrency community today. The US inflation figure was the main focus in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, and it came in below expectations: The dollar didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the hawkish data delivery it wished for this Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, not quite anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving (an admittedly tiny) slither of doubt surrounding the potential December rate hike. The afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad by any means. Retail sales saw a huge bounce from -0.1 to 1.6% month-on-month while consumer confidence hit its highest level since 2004. Yet those readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter to investors, who instead focused on the fact inflation rose from 0.4% to 0.5%, not the 0.6% forecast. With a the Fed constantly mentioning their concerns about weak US inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and how it imperils the chances of an interest rate rise before the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a miss the dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to indulge. Instead the greenback shed 0.2% against both the pound and the euro, while dropping 0.3% against the yen. This allowed the Dow Jones to continue its seemingly unstoppable march to daily all-time highs, with the index lurking just below 22900 following a 50 point rise. As for sterling, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a pretty inconsistent day. The currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managed to hold onto last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp rebound while struggling to maintain a steady grip on this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more modest growth. The inflation situation in the US allowed cable to keep above $1.33; against the euro, however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1265-crossing 9 day highs and sub-$1.12 lows, eventually settling just above that latter level with a 0.1% rise. More US data, and it looks like the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are in confident mood (see also the retail sales figures.) The monthly University of Michigan consumer sentiment index climbed from 95.1 in September to a preliminary reading of 101.1 for October. This is better than the dip to 95 which had been expected, and is the highest level since the start of 2004. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: The October gain was broadly shared, occurring among all age and income subgroups and across all partisan viewpoints. The data indicate a robust outlook for consumer spending that extends the current expansion to at least mid 2018, which would mark the 2nd longest expansion since the mid 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. While the early October surge indicates greater optimism about the future course of the economy, it also reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as it gets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times. ...Nothing in the latest survey indicates that consumers anticipate an economic downturn anytime soon - which contrarians may consider a clear warning sign of trouble ahead. Nonetheless, consumers anticipate low unemployment, low inflation, small increases in interest rates, and most importantly, modest income gains in the year ahead. It is this acceptance of lackluster growth rates in personal income and in the overall economy that signifies that consumers have accepted, however reluctantly, limits on the pace of improving prospects for living standards. The stronger US retail sales and hopes for positive company results have pushed US markets higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher to reach a new peak while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3% to a record high. Not everyone believes a December US rate rise is a certainty, especially after this latest data. John Dolan, senior dealer at FEXCO Corporate Payments, said: In the space of just a week, all bets on a December rate rise are off and the US is further than ever from solving its inflationary puzzle. While a December rate hike had seemed a strong probability after last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid wage growth data, the picture now looks much more finely balanced. As this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC minutes revealed, the Fed remains deeply concerned about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation, or rather, the lack of it. Even though US wages are rising at a reasonable clip, consumer prices are still rising too slowly to require an immediate rate rise. Any December hike would therefore be driven by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to move rates back to more normal levels rather than by any inflationary imperative. While a final hike in 2017 remains a distinct possibility it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a done deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this uncertainty has weighed heavily on the Dollar, dragging it down against both the Euro and sterling. And from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on US inflation: More from the US Commerce Department on the retail sales: The dollar has weakened following the US data, in particular the inflation figures. But - barring political ructions - the Federal Reserve is still on track for a rate rise in February, says James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank: Inflation pressures are grinding higher and domestic activity is strong, suggesting that the main barrier to a higher Fed funds rate is political rather than economic. The US CPI report shows inflation pressures are rising, but this is primarily an energy story reflecting higher oil prices and refinery shutdowns relating to Hurricane Harvey. At the headline level it rose 0.5% month on month/2.2% year on year (a tenth of a percentage point below what was expected). Energy prices rose 6.1% month on month, but excluding food and energy inflationary pressures were more muted, rising just 0.1% month on month/1.7% year on year (again a tenth of a percentage point below expectations). In terms of core inflationary pressures, we are starting to see a bit more upward movement in the housing component, but medical care, apparel and education prices are very soft. Nonetheless, with the economy growing quite strongly, the jobs market looking tight with wage growth starting to show some signs of life we would expect inflation rates to creep higher.... September retail sales [data] has also been released and is strong, rising 1.6%MoM with small upward revisions to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Hurricane effects are clearly visible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher gasoline prices boosted gasoline station sales 5.8%MoM while the fact unit car sales rose to a 12 year high helped boost the value of sales with a 3.6%MoM rise. Strength can also be seen in other components and it is likely that there was some uplift as households start to replace lost items following the recent hurricanes. This has come on top of what is already a strong story for the consumer with employment, wages and confidence all looking healthy. We expect the positive story to continue into next week with industrial production rebounding following storm disruption. After all, the ISM manufacturing index is at a 13 year high, the dollar is making exports more competitive and we are seeing stronger global growth. With overall economic growth looking good, inflation pressures gradually increasing and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about asset valuations and financial stability becoming more prominent in speeches, a December rate hike is looking likely. The main risk remains the potential for an economically/market destabilising government shutdown. Meanwhile US retail sales have bounced back in September, albeit just shy of expectations: Newsflash: inflation across America rose last month, but by less than expected. Consumer prices increased by 0.5% in September, below the 0.6% which Wall Street expected. On an annual basis, US CPI rose by 2.2%, up from 1.9% a month ago. That puts it over the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of a 2% inflation rate. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like food and fuel, was flat at 1.7%. So, is bitcoin a sensible investment at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record levels, or should you keep well away? Cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many supporters will argue that City institutions are waking up to bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential (such as the ability to transfer money safely, securely, and cheaply worldwide). Two weeks ago, it emerged that Goldman Sachs has been considering whether to launch a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies. If that happens, it would arguably be the biggest endorsement yet from Wall Street. But critics argue that the recent rally is a bubble, that could burst if there is a rush to the exits. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investors, says anyone considering investing in digital currencies needs to be cautious: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The value of bitcoin has almost doubled in less than a month which is clearly attracting further interest from speculators. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of growing institutional activity, too, and if China reopens cryptocurrency exchanges after the Communist Party Congress which starts next week, some believe the price could reach $10,000 by the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there could be near-term turbulence around changes to the code the bitcoin network runs on, due to be implemented in mid-November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is crucial that retail investors understand the many risks involved in cryptocurrency trading, not least the volatility - bitcoin has lost more than a third of its value on two occasions since June. It is clearly not for the faint-hearted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pace of bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in recent weeks is quite remarkable. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quadrupled in value this year, despite faltering last month when China announced a crackdown on bitcoin exchanges. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been holding the World Bank to account at their Annual Meeting with the IMF in Washington: Bitcoin is having another one of those days. Having smashed through $5,000 for the first time yesterday, the cryptocurrency soared to $5,846 this morning before dipping back to $5,600 as I type. Last night, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said central bankers and regulators must take digital currencies such as bitcoin seriously, given the way they can disrupt the status quo. Many in the financial industry are struggling to come to terms with the rise of digital currencies, and unconvinced that bitcoin may be an unsustainable bubble. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan became the poster boy for the sceptics last month, when he declared that bitcoin was a fraud that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive. Yesterday he declined to take questions on the issue.... Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, argues that the blockchain technology which underpins bitcoin should be a useful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcutility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to improve the financial system operate. He told Bloomberg TV this morning: I can see that a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be useful in a blockchain context and speeding up interbank transactions. But, Sir Howard reckons that bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme volatility means it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a serious store of value for investors. UBS is also sceptical, saying bitcoin seems to be a bubble. But again, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re attracted to the blockchain -- the digital ledger that tracks digital transations. In a new report, they say: Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity since 2008, with more than 1,000 in existence today and an aggregate value greater than the market capitalization of IBM. But we are highly doubtful whether they will ever become mainstream currencies. The need for companies and individuals to pay tax receipts in government-issued currency, and the potentially unlimited crypto-money supply, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. We think the sharp rise in crypto-currency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble. But while we are doubtful cryptocurrencies will ever become a mainstream means of exchange, the underlying technology, blockchain, is likely to have a significant impact in industries ranging from finance to manufacturing, healthcare, and utilities. We estimate that blockchain could add as much as USD 300-400bn of annual economic value globally by 2027. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has been swept to a new alltime high today: China also hit a milestone for iron ore imports last month, as it bought more higher-quality stocks from abroad. Bloomberg has the details: Iron ore imports by China surged above 100 million metric tons to a record, smashing the previous high set in 2015, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerted push to clean up the environment stoked demand for higher-grade material from overseas while hurting local mine supply. Newsflash: Uber has filed an appeal against the decision to withdraw its licence to operate in London. The ride hiring app lodged its appeal in the courts this morning, ensuring that it can keep operating until the issue has been addressed. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judicial office has told Reuters that a heading could now take place on December 11, into Transport for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that Uber wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fit and proper company to operate in the capital. Today was the deadline for Ober to formally object to TfL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. An Uber spokesman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, Theresa May once again claimed the energy market was broken as she brought forward draft legislation for a price cap. But the big six suppliers, who have around 80% of the market, lost a record number of customers in September. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE collectively lost 163,000 customers over the month, up 127% on September 2016, analysis of official statistics showed. A significant chunk of those switchers would have been British Gas customers, prompted by the firm hiking electricity prices 12.5% for 3.1m customers. Experts at Jefferies bank said that with more than 1m people leaving the big six for challenger firms so far this year, 2017 will be a record year for switching. Next year could see that trend go into reverse, though, with households potentially lulled into complacency by the prospect of an upcoming cap. The FTSE 100 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sharing in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Stocks in London have dropped back from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, as the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery weights on exports. The Footsie is now down by 26 points at 7530. Other European markets are having a better day, though, helping to keep global stocks at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons shares could continue to climb. The bulls have the edge, and a strong US and European earnings should stand them into good stead for the rest of the year. Sterling is rallying this morning, thanks to signals that Britain and the EU might make progress in the Brexit talks. It has risen over $1.33 against the US dollar for the first time in almost two weeks, and is also recovering against the euro. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a turnaround from yesterday, when fears that talks had hit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeadlock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sent the pound sliding. That, though, was before it emerged that European leaders are expected to tell their negotiators to begin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal preparations for future trade talks with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says sterling is on a rollercoaster ride, thanks to a report that the EU are prepared to offer the UK a 2-year transitional deal. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly a fresh-take; a transitional period has been batted about since Brexit day dot. And [EU negotiator Michel] Barnier wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually that much of a doomsayer on Thursday, stating his belief that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was within reach in the next 2 months. But investors are being selective in what Brexit news they want to listen to, with this Handelsblatt report sending sterling sharply higher. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the Chinese economy seems to be in relatively good health, ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communist Party Congress. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data: The September Trade data painted an overall much stronger picture of domestic demand than many had been anticipating, and effectively made clear that the weaker August readings did not signal impending weakness. That said, some of the boost to imports was probably attributable to some front-loading of imports ahead of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Day/Autumn Festival holiday, with more working days this September probably also giving a boost. But the strength of commodity import growth (18.7% y/y) was across the spectrum, underlining the strength of domestic demand, and as much as Exports missed forecasts at 8.1% y/y, this was still a notable acceleration from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5.1%. The oil price has jumped this morning, as the markets react to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18.7% surge in imports. Brent crude has jumped by 1.5% to $57.07 per barrel, with traders anticipating higher demand for energy. Other commodity prices are also rallying, with nickel hitting a one-month high. Iron ore and copper are also up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade with North Korea slumped in September, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data, in a sign that United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang are being implemented. Chinese imports from North Korea fell by almost 38%, including imports of iron ore and coal according to customs spokesman Huang Songping. Chinese exports to North Korea also fell, by 6.7%. More details here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data might irk Donald Trump. According to Reuters, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the US has hit an all-time high. Reuters reports: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States in September rose to $28.08 billion versus $26.23 billion last month, Chinese customs data on Friday showed. The surplus was the highest ever with the U.S. for any single month, based on Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jan-Sept trade surplus with the U.S. was $195.54 billion, the data showed. That could give fresh ammunition to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has long complained that the trade imbalance between the two nations hurts the U.S. economy. The strong Chinese trade data sent MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All-Country World Share index up to a new peak, at 494.84 points. The index, which tracks equities across the globe, has been rising steadily this year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are touching new record highs this morning, after new Chinese trade data indicated the global economy was strengthening. China smashed forecasts overnight, reporting that imports surged by a remarkable 18.7% per year in September. Exports rose by 8.1%, a little below forecasts but still a solid result. The leap in imports suggests that Chinese factories are continuing to see strong demand for their products; an encouraging sign for world growth. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers will be pleased, as they prepare for next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communist Party Congress. This also means that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has narrowed, as Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capital, shows here: Chinese government officials have hailed the data, saying it shows the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is on track. CNBC has the details: Huang Songping, spokesman for the Customs department told a press conference on Friday that trade for the first three quarters improved due to a recovery in overall global and domestic economic environment. There has been a return in global demand, he added. Barring unforeseen events, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will post double-digit growth in foreign trade this year, said Huang. Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, called the data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems the global demand is still there to support the demand for Chinese exports.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees, saying: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data was fairly supportive of a fairly robust domestic economy. Asian stock markets rose to a 10-year high following the data, while Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei struck at 21-year high: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 joined the party last night, hitting a new record closing high. That was partly down to a weaker pound, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 also hit a new high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story: The Times also gave it a good show: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda for the day: 1.30pm BST: US inflation data for September. Prices are expected to have risen by 0.6% during the month. A strong reading raises the chances of a US interest rate rise. From 2pm BST: The IMF and the World Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Annual Meeting continues. Central bank chiefs, finance ministers, economists and investors will bd discussing the state of the global economy 3pm BST: The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer confidence report. 6pm BST: The weekly Baker Hughes oil rig count. A good measure of whether oil producers are ramping up output, or cutting back We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also have an eye on Bitcoin, which smashed through $5,000 to a record high yesterday.",

New deputy governor Dave Ramsden was pretty dovish this morning, and while his MPC peer Silvana Tenreyro was slightly more open to a rate hike, she said any move is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery contingent on the data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which, at the moment, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great sign for sterling).</p> <p>BoE chief Mark Carney arguably dealt the biggest blow to the pound. Though the central bank head honcho said the MPC thinks a hike may be appropriate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin the coming months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, that comment potentially pushes the pulling of the interest rate trigger beyond the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting in early November.</p> <p>That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all. Carney warned on the negative impact a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would have on the economy, while stating that businesses are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcless confident about a smooth transition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

The Federal Reserve had suggested in advance of the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publication that the data would be liable to revision given a lack of information on which operations were back up and running after Hurricane Harvey while Hurricane Irma will have had a depressing effect on figures from Florida.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the outlook remains positive with manufacturing set to strengthen in coming months. The domestic story is encouraging with the ISM manufacturing headline figure at a 13 year high while the softer dollar (relative to last year) and strengthening foreign demand should support exports. Meanwhile, mining output should gradually move higher given rising oil prices and rig counts. Consequently, we look for the sector to make a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter GDP even if it has disappointed in third quarter through the hit from the storms.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e608002292c906574edd24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-17T13:47:45.360Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US, industrial production for September has edged up in line with forecasts.</p> <p>It rose 0.3% compared to a decline of 0.7% in August, itself revised up from an initial 0.9% fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/920277041878126592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnitedStates?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UnitedStates</a> Industrial Production month-on-month at 0.3%  <a href=\"https://t.co/d2vCgluAuV\">https://t.co/d2vCgluAuV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hMBHGW6Noq\">pic.twitter.com/hMBHGW6Noq</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/920277041878126592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 15 points or 0.07% in early trading to a new record high.

                "bodyText":"A down day for equities, with European markets mostly finishing lower. After edging towards another closing high, the FTSE 100 finally ended in the red despite a dip in the pound. Sterling suffered on continuing Brexit fears and following dovish comments from members of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee. Elsewhere the main markets took a breather although Spain bucked the trend, with the Ibex recovering from its recent weakness in the wake of the row over Catalan independence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 10.80 points or 0.14% at 7516.17 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.07% to 12,995.06 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.03% at 5361.37 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.4% to 22,337.78 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 10,216.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.51% to 761.82 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, having briefly moved above 23,000, is currently up 0.09% at 22,976. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The Dow above 23,000 was short-lived, for the moment at least. It is still up, but just 0.08% at 22,976. Commenting on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising stock markets, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global stocks have enjoyed another day of gains, with the now customary record highs in US indices this time driven by an outperformance in the banking sector. The dollar strengthened, with European currencies losing ground amid uncertainty fueled by Catalonia and Brexit. With the yen and gold losing ground, there is a clear shift into risk assets to the detriment of perceived havens. The latest US earnings season is underway, and US financials are heading higher in the wake of impressive figures from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. ..the impressive overall profitability in US banking does help instill confidence in an environment of rising rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has crossed 23,000 for the first time, as the surge in stock markets continues. The move comes not long after it breached the 22,000 barrier on 2 August. The comments from the Bank of England outweighed strong inflation figures as far as the pound is concerned, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Rate hike uncertainty spoiled what could have been an incredibly hawkish day for the pound, given that inflation hit a 5 year high of 3.0% in September. The Bank of England ended up distracting sterling from that alarmingly high CPI reading. New deputy governor Dave Ramsden was pretty dovish this morning, and while his MPC peer Silvana Tenreyro was slightly more open to a rate hike, she said any move is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery contingent on the data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which, at the moment, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great sign for sterling). BoE chief Mark Carney arguably dealt the biggest blow to the pound. Though the central bank head honcho said the MPC thinks a hike may be appropriate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin the coming months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, that comment potentially pushes the pulling of the interest rate trigger beyond the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting in early November. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all. Carney warned on the negative impact a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would have on the economy, while stating that businesses are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcless confident about a smooth transition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The OECD also got involved, claiming a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisorderly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would reduce Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclong-term growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Combine that with the prospect of some miserable wage growth and retail sales figures on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and some decent import prices and industrial production data from the US, and cable had a truly dreadful afternoon. The pound fell 0.7% against the dollar, sending it back towards $1.31; sterling fared a bit better against the euro, and even then it slipped 0.3%. The FTSE couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t squeeze too much growth out of this situation, with the UK index still stuck below 7550, a level its struggled to break for the past week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart from ING Bank showing UK inflation excluding the movements in the pound and oil price: Back with the pound: The outlook for US manufacturing looks upbeat even if the recent hurricanes have a negative effect on the short term figures, reckons James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank. Following the industrial production figures, he said: US Industrial production rose 0.3% month on month, in line with expectations. A two-tenths upward revision to August was also announced (-0.7% versus -0.9% originally reported). The details show that manufacturing output rose 0.1% month on month, utilities grew 1.5% month on month while mining was up 0.4% month on month. The Federal Reserve had suggested in advance of the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publication that the data would be liable to revision given a lack of information on which operations were back up and running after Hurricane Harvey while Hurricane Irma will have had a depressing effect on figures from Florida. Nonetheless, the outlook remains positive with manufacturing set to strengthen in coming months. The domestic story is encouraging with the ISM manufacturing headline figure at a 13 year high while the softer dollar (relative to last year) and strengthening foreign demand should support exports. Meanwhile, mining output should gradually move higher given rising oil prices and rig counts. Consequently, we look for the sector to make a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter GDP even if it has disappointed in third quarter through the hit from the storms. Over in the US, industrial production for September has edged up in line with forecasts. It rose 0.3% compared to a decline of 0.7% in August, itself revised up from an initial 0.9% fall. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 15 points or 0.07% in early trading to a new record high. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.5 points at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 3.44 points. The uncertain start came despite reasonable results from investment banking giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The pound is down around 0.5%, partly on the downbeat Brexit comments from the OECD and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. It has also been affected by Carney saying interest rates would rise in the months ahead, which was taken to mean not necessarily in November as expected, as well as dovish remarks from other members of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee. The fall in sterling has given a lift to the FTSE 100, which has a large number of exporters who benefit from a weaker pound. The leading index is currently up 20 points or 0.28%. Time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has hit a new five-year high, taking another bite out of wages and bringing more pain for those relying on government benefits. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 3.0% in the 12 months to September, the highest level since early 2012. Food and transport costs were important factors behind the rise, which economists are blaming on the weak pound driving up import costs. The figures mean that the state pension is on track to rise by 3% next year, under the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple-lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy. It also means that real wages have continued to fall -- average earnings only rose by 2.1% in the three months to July; new labour market figures due tomorrow are unlikely to show much improvement. Bank of England governor Mark Carney predicted that inflation will probably rise higher in the next couple of months, before dipping back. Testifying to the Treasury committee, Carney warned that European states have not done as much work as the UK on the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. He also told MPs that firms are losing confidence that Brexit will proceed smoothly to a new trading arrangement. Carney also argued forcefully that a transition period, of at least two years, would help resolve issues such as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive derivatives market. The rise in inflation could spur the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. But some City experts warn that this would harm the economy, and do little to bring down import prices. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says Mark Carney et al have a difficult decision: This has been a tricky year for the central bank, especially when considering how elevated inflation levels have squeezed household spending - impacting the outlook for the economy. With inflation leaving average earnings in the dust, consumers are feeling the pinch and as such, it threatens the sustainability of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer-driven growth. While the argument for higher rates is to put a lid on inflation, this may end up punishing the fragile UK economy. Union leaders have urged the government to raise public sector wages, which would help nurses, teachers, police officers et al to handle inflation. Liberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable agrees, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Brexit squeeze caused by the falling pound is getting worse, and it is hitting the poorest families hardest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This above-target inflation is increasing the cost of the weekly shop and cutting into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor must end the benefits freeze that is set to leave millions of families hundreds of pounds poorer a year. Above all, the government must change course from a destructive Brexit that would damage living standards and push up prices further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Mark Carney today, warning that inflation will probably rise further in October or November: And finally, governor Carney is asked about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender pay gap. He says Bank is planning to publish details next month. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy to give some top lines now. Namely... The median gender pay gap is 24% The mean pay gap is 21%. But, on an equal work for equal pay assessment, there is no gender pay gap. The gaps exists because there are more men at the top of the Bank than lower down the ranks, who are paid more. Carney insists the Bank is committed to improving diversity. He cites \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recruitment panels, spreading the recruitment net beyond economists, hiring from 40 universities (up from just 10). If you start from a position of being almost exclusively a white male institution, you need to have a deliberate strategy of movement. In the end, the Bank expects to be in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middle of the pack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the financial services industry on gender, but near the top for the public sector. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the session. Back in the Thatcher Room, Mark Carney is invited to dwell on the benefits of Brexit.... The governor cited a few, including: The opportunity to negotiate trade deals focused on UK interests Tailoring regulations to focus on the specifics of the UK economy. The opportunity to step back and look at a host of wider issues, such as fiscal policy, the labour market, education policy. But, Parliament will have to decide the balance of those opportunities versus striking a transition deal and a new arrangement with the EU. Carney denies that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme, which has bought \u00c2\u00a3425bn of bonds with newly created money, is the monetary equivalent of heroin. Breaking away from Mark Carney (and inflation), the Treasury has slapped down the OECD after it suggested that Britain could stay in the European Union. The Paris-based think tank argued this morning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would get a boost if it chose not to follow through with Brexit. In its annual assessment of the UK, the OECD predicted that growth would slow in 2018 year and business investment fall. It also warned that a hard Brexit would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would hurt trading relationships and reduce long-term growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boost if the Brexit vote was reversed, perhaps through a second referendum, it suggested. In response, the Treasury has insisted that the public won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to change last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe are working to achieve the best deal with the EU that protects jobs and the economy. We aim to agree a Free Trade Agreement that is comprehensive and ambitious. Our \u00c2\u00a323 billion National Productivity Investment Fund which will improve our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure, increase research and development and build more houses. We are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report was presented to the press in London this morning, but chancellor Philip Hammond didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hang around long enough to take questions.... Q: Should fiscal policy be taking more of the strain to help the UK economy? Unsurprisingly, Mark Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be lured into commenting on tax and spending policies. We take fiscal policy as given, he insists, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for us to advise the government. And on house prices, he says the housing market faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153structural problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not building enough new homes) but argues that prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a bubble (reminder, they rose by 5% per year in August). He says the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Help to Buy hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a major impact on the market, either in terms of prices or stimulating a lot of new builds. The pound has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar since Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony began. Sterling may be suffering from the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings about a no-deal Brexit Q: Does the Bank of England have a clue about why UK productivity is so weak? Carney says he does have a clue yes...and after more prodding from the committee he cites weak business investment and the wider impact of economic uncertainty. Q: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden is growing, thanks to consumer credit products such as PCPs used to buy new cars. When will the bubble blow up? Carney argues that auto finance is not as serious as some claim. If someone walks away from a PCP plan then the debt falls on the car vendor - or in many cases the manufacturer of the car. He says banks are well-capitalised to handle a rise in bad debts. Q: When must a transition deal be agreed, before firms take matters into their own hands and trigger their contingency plans? Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to a fixed date, but says the issue is particularly urgent for the City. Q: How have businesses and consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attitude to Brexit changed? Mark Carney indicates that UK firms have become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less confident about a smooth transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and less confident about the end state of Brexit. Households are less worried, he says, At present, household expectations are broadly consistent with a smooth outcome to a future arrangement. But consumer confidence has fallen, partly due to lower real incomes (due to rising inflation). Carney adds that financial markets are the most concerned - they have already priced in a significant adjustment to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future prospects, and they may have to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmark up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future performance [if Brexit goes better than some fear]. Q: What preparations are you making for Brexit? Carney says the Bank of England has looked at worse-case scenarios, and what we can do to mitigate those risks. That includes making sure that banks are sufficiently capitalised to handle a very bad outcome. On the upside, the Bank could raise its growth forecasts if Britain agrees a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full, comprehensive, ambitious arrangement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the rest of the EU. The Treasury committee are probing Mark Carney about how the trillions worth of derivatives contracts between the UK and other EU country members will be handled after Brexit. Mark Carney says this cannot be resolved if Britain crashes out without a deal. Q: Is a two-year transition period enough to resolve this problem? Carney says that the best solution would be legislation that would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grandfather those contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so that they could continue to be honoured after Brexit. He also cites cross-border insurance (European companies and individuals who have taken out insurance from UK entities) and cross-border data concerns. And...he repeats his argument that a hard Brexit would hurt Europe more than the UK on these issues. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more data that is relevant to the EU in the UK than vice versa... These issues are bigger for Europe than they are for us, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re material for us. Bang on cue, Mark Carney argues that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit poses a threat to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability. He tells the Treasury committee that Europe would be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort of financial services capacity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the short term, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The entire economic impacts are greater for the UK, he says, but the financial stability impact is greater for the EU in the short term. Breaking: Britain faces long-term decline unless it secures \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the closest possible economic relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the European Union after Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD), in its annual healthcheck on the UK economy. More here: Carney argues that Britain and the EU will agree a transition deal, as avoiding a hard Brexit will be in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests. Carney is asked about concerns that some banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU in 2019. He replies that European-based institutions have done much less preparation than UK banks for the possibility of a hard exit from the EU without any transition deal. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing all those preparations for that. There has been much less of that done in the European Union, including by the member firms. Q: What would happen if the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro clearing market moved abroad after Brexit? Carney warns that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real economy would suffer higher costs if the euro clearing market was fragmented [currently, trillions of pounds, euros, dollars and yen-based derivatives contracts are settled in London, under a system of clearing houses set up to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis] Q: So are you lobbying behind the scenes for talks on this issue to begin soon? Carney says the Bank of England would like the UK to have the go-ahead to start talks, with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistance when needed. And he insists that breaking up the derivatives market would mean that European car makers and pension funds, for example, would pay more for financial transactions. Carney also points out that the Bank of England is already trying to stimulate the economy: Q: With interest rates at just 0.25%, the UK doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much room to cut if there is a recession. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be wise to raise borrowing costs to give the Bank more ammunition when needed? Carney isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at all convinced that this is a good idea. He explains to the committee that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium term. Raising rates today so you can cut them tomorrow wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really fit with that remit. As Carney puts it: Building a war chest in interest rate terms for a potential future shock, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying on point in terms of the inflation target, nor is it appropriate or necessary given that policy can move quite nimbly if required. Q: Are you concerned that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net international investment position has been revised down by \u00c2\u00a3490bn (as reported by the Daily Telegraph yesterday)? Carney says that the stock of UK assets, as opposed to the flows, is quite healthy. He points out that Britain still owns a lot of assets in the rest of the world (but not as much as previously thought). And the fall in the pound actually improves that position. The UK owes a lot in sterling, and owns a lot in foreign currency assets. With the depreciation [of the pound] you get a positive move. Carney also warns that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustainable level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit (which is running a hefty deficit) will ultimately depend on the future trade relationship with Europe. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to the Treasury Committee now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live, here. Q: Inflation has risen to 3% - only 0.1% away from the level when you must write a letter to the chancellor explaining why you have missed your target. Do you expect to write a letter soon? Carney says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more likely than not\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he will write to Philip Hammond in the next few months to explain why inflation is more than one percentage point away from 2%. He says the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote means inflation is likely to rise over 3% \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the coming weeks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He reminds the committee that the Bank of England signalled prior to the referendum that the pound would be hit by a vote to leave the EU. We expected sterling to fall sharply. It did. That passes through to prices.... The sole reason that inflation has gone up as much as it has is the depreciation of sterling. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensioners will receive a 3% increase in their state income next year after the annual inflation rate reached its highest level since early 2012 last month. The 12-month increase in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) edged up from 2.9% to 3% - in line with recent Bank of England forecasts. Any further increase would force Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond explaining why inflation was not being kept to its 2% target. The City expects the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates next month for the first time in more than a decade. Inflation has risen from 1% to 3% over the past year, largely due to the fall in the value of the pound, which has made imports dearer. The Office for National Statistics said the cost of fuel and raw materials for industry were up by 8.4% on a year ago compared with a 7.6% increase in the 12 months to August. It said more expensive food and a smaller fall in air fares than a year ago were the main factors explaining higher inflation, although clothes had come down in price. The pick-up in inflation means the state pension will rise by at least 3% next year because the so-called triple lock means it rises by the September inflation rate, the September increase in annual earnings or 2.5%. Annual earnings are currently rising by just over 2%. More here: Back in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro has been quizzed by the Treasury committee. Tenreyro told MPs that she could vote for an interest rate rise in the coming months, but only if the data justified it. She said evidence from US studies of interest rate hikes and cuts showed that a premature move to increase the cost of borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can be costly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. [Studies show that] if it turns out to be a mistake it will require a lot more cuts in the future in order to recover that lost ground\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tenreyo is among the majority of MPC members who would vote for a rate hike in the coming months, as articulated at their last meeting in September. But she may hold back from voting to raise rates if the data paints a weaker picture of the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My position now is that if the data outturns are consistent with the picture i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just described, of an output gap going towards zero, then i would be minded to vote for a bank rate increase in the coming months. However that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very contingent, and i should be clear, on the data outturns. If the data undershoots and the data are not in line with those expectations then i will wait until i see further evidence of that output gap being eroded.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tenreyo also thinks the UK is some way from removing its package of quantitative easing support for the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are still far from that point at which we will start unwinding given that the bank rate is so low.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tenreyro also told MPs that her experience growing up in Argentina would be valuable. That raised some eyebrows..... hopefully the UK won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be turning to the IMF anytime soon..... Labour MP Angela Rayner tweets: The well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies makes in important point. The rise in inflation means the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of freezing benefits is causing more pain than anticipated. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, says the whole policy is discredited. Could Philip Hammond make changes in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible, but the problem is that letting benefits rise in line with inflation would cost money. And the chancellor doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much of a war chest to play with... In other news, UK house price inflation has picked up -- but not in London. Average house prices in the UK rose by 5.0% in the year to August 2017, up from 4.5% in July 2017. However, prices in the capital actually fell during the month, and are only 2.4% higher than a year ago. That might help some younger people to get onto the housing market (although the average London house price is still \u00c2\u00a3484,000). Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, points out that prices in the financial district have taken a serious knock. The uncertainty over Brexit may be felt more keenly in London than other areas due to the importance of international businesses. Figures from the City of London borough bear this out where prices are down 18.4% compared to a year ago. Amit Kara of the NIESR thinktank warns that UK inflation could keep rising in the next few months: Newsflash: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest deputy governor has revealed that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one of the policymakers who believe interest rates need to rise soon. Sir Dave Ramsden has told the Treasury Committee that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t among the majority at last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting who said that they were close to voting for a hike. Instead, Ramsden took the view that the UK economy was ready for higher borrowing costs. The majority of MPC members saw a case for removing some of the monetary stimulus in the coming months. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in that majority. This was my first ever MPC member as a voter. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a position where I was part of that majority that thought - the way the degree of slack was diminishing, the way trade off between slack and higher inflation was disappearing - was sufficient to give that signal. Scotiabank also blame the weak pound for driving inflation up: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the slump in the pound after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is the main factor driving UK inflation up. These charts show how the cost of goods has spiked over the last year. Britain is a net importer of actual stuff, so a weaker pound means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply more expensive to bring raw materials and finished products into the country. In contrast, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate was just 1.5% in September, meaning most Europeans should be enjoying real wage rises. Open Britain, the campaign group against a Hard Brexit, argues that Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to lose full access to the Single Market. Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon, fears that the pound could suffer fresh losses if Britain and Brussels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieve progress in the Brexit taslks. While there are signs of a slowing economy, with sterling still at risk as Brexit negotiations remain inconclusive the British economy remains vulnerable to further inflationary forces. UNISON, the public sector union, argues that the government needs to produce a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecent pay rise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to make up for years of austerity. General secretary Dave Prentis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no light at the end of the tunnel for public service workers. Unfunded, below-inflation pay awards are apparently the best the government has to offer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All public servants have seen the value of their pay fall year on year. They need a decent pay rise that more than matches the rising cost of living.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Treasury has responded to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures, arguing that the government is helping where it can... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand that families are feeling the effects of inflation and we are helping them with their living costs. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve frozen fuel duty, doubled free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and cut income tax for 30 million people. Increases to the National Living Wage are also delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest paid in 20 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Resolution Foundation points out that UK welfare benefits are NOT rising in line with inflation (unlike pensions...). This means that the poorest in our communities will find it even harder to get by next year, even if they are in work. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, warns that rising inflation will eat into our Christmas budgets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now starting to feel the real impact of Brexit on our wallets. With inflation at a five-year high there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escaping the fact that the luxury of low inflation is well and truly over with prices of goods and services rising left right and centre and the shiny new pounds in our pockets will unfortunately buy you less. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your household budget will be stretched as the cost of transport is creeping up and the price of fuel and food is also on the up. The cost of your supermarket shop is rising too so you must act now to protect yourself from future struggles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices are rising faster than earnings and we are heading into one of the most expensive times of year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Christmas, so budgeting is key.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensioners are the big winners from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report, thanks to the triple-lock that guarantees that their pensions won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lag behind prices. So argues Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Life is getting much more expensive with an increase in the cost of food, fuel and a last-minute price spike in flights all contributing to the rise in inflation. Meanwhile, our pay packets have stagnated with wage growth falling behind inflation, despite UK unemployment being at a record low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figure matters hugely to both retirees and savers. Under the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 guarantee, the state pension will rise in April each year by whichever number is the highest out of the September CPI inflation number, average earnings or 2.5%. With inflation running higher than either wages or 2.5%, this will be determine the rise in the State Pension next year, arguably making retirees the biggest winners from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figure. The Federation of Small Businesses is aghast that its members face a 3.9% increase in business rates next year, thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RPI inflation report (details here) Mike Cherry, the FSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national chairman, says UK firms have suffered enough, following the controversial revaluation process that send some bills spiralling higher. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RPI figure follows six months of business rates misery for our small business community. Since April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruising revaluation we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the staircase tax, introduction of an unworkable appeals platform and chronic delays to the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3435 million relief package. A near four per cent bill increase next April, on top of losing year one transitional caps, will be the last straw for many. The TUC, which represents millions of British workers, says the government needs to respond to the ongoing wage squeeze that is hurting UK households. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to face up to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis. The squeeze on household budgets is getting tighter by the month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor must use November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget to ease the pressure on hard-pressed families. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means giving five million public sector workers the pay rise they have earned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices are sky-rocketing. Offering hard-working public servants below-inflation increases would amount to yet another real-terms pay cut.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also argues that the Bank of England should not raise interest rates from their current alltime low of 0.25% \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Raising interest rates now would be a big mistake. The UK economy is simply not strong enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to get wages rising before we start think about hiking rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is one of the most depressing charts in UK economics today -- showing how UK workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay packets are shrinking in real terms. As you can see, its the second wage squeeze in a decade. The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, rose by 3.9% in September. That means that UK firms face a 3.9% rise in their business rates next year, under the current system. It could also drive up costs for motorists. Rising food prices helped to drive UK inflation to a five-year high of 3.0% in September. The Office for National Statistics says: The rate of 2.6% for recreation and culture is the highest since January 2010, whilst the rate of 3.1% for food and non-alcoholic beverages is the highest since October 2013.... Housing and household services costs were the biggest single factor driving the cost of living up, the ONS adds, partly due to utility bills. This chart shows how UK inflation has risen sharply, to its highest level since April 2012 Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has hit a new five and a half-year high. The consumer prices index jumped by 3.0% in September, up from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.9%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since early 2012. This means that British workers are still suffering a pay squeeze, as average wages only rose by 2.1% per year in the three months to July. But I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better news for pensioners, who can look forward to a 3% increase in the basic state pension next April. Under the triple-lock system, pensions rise in line with earnings growth, September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI reading, or by 2.5%, whichever number is biggest. More to follow! A reminder of why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading is particularly important: Analysts at HSBC reckon the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate jumped to 3.1% last month: Yikes! Shares in entertainment group Merlin have slumped by 20% in early trading. Merlin has shocked the City by warning it suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult trading conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the summer. The company, which runs Alton Towers, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye, said terrorism was partly to blame: The spate of terror attacks witnessed in the UK marked an inflection point in Midway London and UK theme park trading. Poor weather in Northern Europe and extreme weather in Italy and Florida also impacted peak season trading. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some handy graphs on UK inflation, ahead of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data in 30 minutes time. This one shows how inflation typically tracks moves in the value of the pound (but roughly two years later) This chart shows how the oil price influences the cost of living: Sterling is inching higher this morning, as City traders anticipate UK inflation hitting its highest levels since 2012. The pound has gained almost half a eurocent against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2175. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up a more modest 0.1% against the US dollar, at $1.3263. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker (and David Davis and Michel Barnier) producing nothing more than vague promise to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaccelerate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negotiations, the pound is on the rise this Tuesday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are eagerly awaiting September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading, which is set to see the consumer price index finally hit a 5 year high of 3.0%. Such a reading would put even more pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, though that hawkish urge may be tempered by the continued fall in real wages (set to be confirmed tomorrow) and a sharp month-on-month drop in retail sales (coming on Thursday). Two years ago, CPI inflation was actually negative, at -0.1%. That was partly to falling oil prices, which delivered cheaper petrol, and price wars between UK supermarkets. But, as this chart shows, the inflation rate inched higher in late 2015 and early 2016 - and then accelerated sharply once the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. Higher petrol prices and utility bills probably drove UK inflation up in September. Airline ticket prices could also push the consumer prices index up to 3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault; customers scrambled to buy new flights after it cancelled thousands of trips last month. Food, clothing and footwear are all \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwild cards\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that could push inflation over 3%, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate could hit a new five-year high this morning, hitting people in the pocket and putting more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates in November. City economists predict that inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, jumped to 3.0% in September. That would be an increase on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.9%, and the highest level since spring 2012. If so, this would be the latest proof that the fall in the pound since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote is pushing up prices and hurting households and businesses. It would also mean that prices are rising faster than earnings. The average pay packet only grew by 2.1% over the last year, meaning that real wages are falling. Finn McLaughlin of Capital Economics says: We expect that CPI inflation (09.30 BST) rose from 2.9% in August to 3% in September, intensifying the real wage squeeze. That said, we suspect inflation is now not far from its eventual peak. We think that it will rise to about 3.2% before year-end. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures are particularly important as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be used to set next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensions rises (under the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, pensions rise in line with wages, prices, or 2.5% - whichever is higher). The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, will be used to set next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business rates. It is expected to rise to 4% today, which would mean a 4% rise in business rates for UK firms. If CPI rises by 3.1% or more, then the Bank of England will have to write to the government explaining why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not keeping inflation close to its 2% target. With excellent timing, BoE governor Mark Carney and colleagues are testifying to MPs on the Treasury this morning, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what they say about inflation, Brexit, and the state of the economy. Also coming up today: The row between aircraft makers Boeing and Bombardier has taken a dramatic turn overnight; Airbus, the European consortium, is taking a controlling stake in Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C Series business. That division, which employs thousands in Northern Ireland, was hit with US tariffs totalling 300% last month following a complaint from Boeing. Could this deal protect jobs? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you more details as they come in Theme park operator Merlin Entertainment, online fashion retailer ASOS and model toy maker Hornby are all reporting results this morning too.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joshua Mahony of IG to sum up th day: Early losses have been partially erased throughout European equities today, after a sharp Catalonia driven selloff was largely pushed aside, with traders seeing the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to invoke article 155 as a positive for economic and political stability. While the potential for further Catalan protest means a degree of uncertainty remains, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions have allayed much of the market fears, driving the euro higher throughout the day. UK consumers continue to experience a tough time of it recently, with pressure from all sides reducing the amount of disposable income available for households. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in retail sales comes as no surprise given this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, with CPI rising to 3.0%, paving the way for a continued deterioration in real incomes as the year progresses. With wages failing to keep up with inflation, and many mortgages due to rise in the event of a November rate rise, the continued deterioration in retail sales is a product of an economic squeeze on UK consumers, at a time when confidence remains depleted. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The Catalonian independence struggle has taken another twist today, with the Madrid indicating it will trigger article 155 of Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitution, a move that would suspend the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autonomy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on a saga that is causing tensions in the financial markets. European markets have closed for the night, with small losses across the board. The FTSE 100 lost 0.3%, amid worries over the UK retail slowdown and underwhelming results from Unilever this morning. There were deeper falls on other indices, as Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government moved closer to taking direct control of Catalonia. It was rather worse 30 years ago..... A UK government spokesperson has responded to Blankfein.... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m disappointed they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t defend the coded attack on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Lloyd Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit intervention: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market remains in rude health. Just 222,000 US citizens filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since 1973. It follows a spike as firms were disrupted by the hurricanes that smashed their way through several US states in recent weeks (also causing massive damage in the Caribbean). Over in New York, Wall Street has opened in the red on the 30th anniversary of Black Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average is down almost 100 points, or 0.4% - a small dip, after days of record highs. Apple shares have fallen by 2%, following reports that the tech giant is cutting production of its new iPhone 8. I agree with Laura... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Philip Coggan of the Economist on Lloyd Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention.... Lloyd Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet about spending a lot more time in Frankfurt has caused a stir at the EU council meeting in Brussels. Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention puts more pressure on Theresa May to secure a transition deal, and soon. City firms are expected to activate their contingency plans for a hard Brexit early next year, unless there is progress in the negotiations.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to Blankfein may still be sore about the EU referendum result. Back in January 2016, Goldman Sachs donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. Lloyd Blankfein, the boss of Goldman Sachs, has dropped a very loud hint that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be moving jobs from the UK to Germany thanks to Brexit. Blankfein, one of the most powerful bankers in the world, tweets: Goldman has just leased space in a Frankfurt skyscraper, with room for 800 staff, as it tries to minimise disruption once Britain leaves the EU. After Brexit, City banks will lose passporting rights to sell services across Europe. Goldman said two weeks ago that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This expanded office space will allow us to grow our operations in Germany to continue serving our clients, as well as provide us with the space to execute on our Brexit contingency plan as needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The City likes a good anniversary - a chance for older hands to impress young guns with tales of market mayhem. And they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come much bigger than Black Monday in 1987, when shares crashed around the globe, wiping more than 20% off the Dow Jones. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a classic front page from the big day: But for such a big crash, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable how quickly shares bounced back (not like the Great Crash of 1929, and the subsequent Great Depression). The crash may have deterred some people from risking their money in the stock market. But, as this chart shows, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have done well if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bought shares to years ago (as long as you avoided Japan and Greece...) So, could it happen again? Well....some experts have blamed the crash on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcportfolio insurance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This was designed to protect investors from being wiped out, but in reality it forced them to sell assets to into a falling market, making the slump worse and worse. Matt Maley, who worked at Solomon Brothers (in the days of Liar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Poker), explained more here. Chris Godding, CIO of investment manager Tilney, argues that the markets work better today, Speaking on Sky News, he cites better controls in the equity markets today, and circuit breakers that would give investors time to evaluate. However, currency markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have such cushions, so they could be the places to look for the next market panic, bedlam or crash... Stock markets are marking the 30th anniversary of Black Monday today, by taking a collective bath into the red. European markets are down almost 1%, and on track for their worst day in seven weeks (which shows how calm things have been recently). In London, the FTSE 100 is still down around 40 points, with Unilever down 4% after missing sales forecasts this morning. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to drop when trading being in New York (at 9.30am local time). Some traders are blaming Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who warned today that the markets could suffer a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Minsky moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That means a sudden plunge in asset valuations, following a period of stability which encouraged people to speculate and drive prices unsustainably high..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the UK retail sales gloom: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers are under the cosh, says Mike Cherry, who chairs the Federation of Small Businesses. He blames the fall in the pound since the EU referendum, and the lack of clarity over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures reflect the perfect storm of challenges facing our small retailers. Rising input costs, flagging consumer demand and chronic delays to business rates relief are all weighing on our high streets. A weak pound may be boosting our exporters but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proving to be a real drag on spending power. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then we have the Brexit element. One in five small employers has EU staff on their books \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until these vital workers have concrete guarantees about their right to remain, retailers will be in a perpetual state of uncertainty. This will hamper their ability create new jobs in future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence among small retailers has plummeted over the last two quarters. The Chancellor must step in at the Budget. The least he can do is ensure his \u00c2\u00a3435 million package of rates relief measures is fully in place by 22 November.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Briton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literally tightened their belts last month, it seems. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales report shows that the amount of food bought in the shops fell by 1.2% in September, compared to a year ago. However, the amount spent on food rose by 1.6%, because inflation has driven up prices. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures make a hat-trick of worrying UK economic data this week. On Tuesday, inflation jumped to 3% - its highest level in four and a half-years. More expensive food and fuel was partly to blame. On Wednesday, we learned that earnings are only rising by 2.1%. That means that real wages shrank in the three months to August, despite the jobless rate sticking at a 42-year low. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSeptember\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures show some evidence of belt tightening, with discretionary spending taking a particularly big hit, as shoppers prioritise more essential items as prices rise. This has given the pound a bit of a bloody nose on the currency markets, with investors scaling back their expectations of a rate rise from the Bank of England. The 0.8% drop in UK retail sales in September shows that the surge in inflation since the Brexit vote is hurting So argues PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Sentance. He points out that retail sales growth has fallen sharply this year, to below its long-term average. Sentance explains: The underlying trend is towards slower retail growth and we are seeing the weakest rate of increase in the volume of spending for over four years and since the summer of 2013. In the past three months, year-on-year sales volumes were up just 1.5%, compared with around 4% annual growth in the three years 2014 to 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main reason for this slowdown is inflation. Prices of goods bought in shops, at petrol stations and online in September were 3.3% up on a year ago, whereas only a year ago they were falling by 1%. This surge in inflation - which mainly reflects the fall in sterling since the EU Referendum vote - is squeezing consumers and holding back the growth of retail spending in volume terms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says Theresa May should be worried.... Evidence is growing to suggest that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoppers are keeping wallets in pockets against a backdrop of growing uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Five-year high inflation combined with slow wage growth has consumers feeling the pinch.... Philip Shaw of Investec agrees that UK households are struggling as the cost of living rises. Howard Archer of EY Item Club says the figures could deter the Bank of England from raising borrowing costs next month: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, on the retail sales slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uncomfortable questions have been raised about just where UK growth is going to emerge from in Q4. Consumption is the engine of the UK economy and the retail sector, which hammered by a weak pound, tighter margins and customers beset by real wage declines are in the eye of the storm at the moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will find out in the coming months whether this is consumers holding off on purchases in preparation for Christmas, or whether the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging on interest rate rises has been enough to keep some hands in pockets. We can but hope that this weakening sales pattern is also bringing about a slowing of the consumer credit expansion; retail sales in the past have been powered by a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy-now-pay-later\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality and we continue to worry about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy-now-default-later\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given real wages are shrinking, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a surprise that people are buying less stuff in the shops. Alex Marsh, managing director of Close Brothers Retail Finance, suggests that consumer confidence has dipped - although there are other reasons why shoppers cut back: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the unexpectedly positive uplift in retail sales in August, this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures signal a downturn in consumer confidence as the ONS reports a 0.8% decrease in retail sales last month. September is a notoriously busy month for those returning to full time education and embarking on graduate jobs, leaving limited time for shopping. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153back to normality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd month sees consumers returning to a more reserved level of spending as consumers resume their regular routines and holiday expenditure slows. City economists had only expected UK retail sales to dip by 0.1% last month, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.8% decline is alarming traders. The big picture in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales report is that growth has slowed significantly over the last three months: The pound has fallen by over half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.314. The news that UK shoppers cut back last month has disappointed the City, as it may signal that the economy is slowing. NEWSFLASH: UK retail sales were much weaker than expected last month. The amount bought across the retail industry shrank by 0.8% during September, a sign that consumers reined in their spending. Non-food stores suffered the biggest decline in takings. That means that retail sales volumes over the last year have only risen by 1.2%. The Office for National Statistics also reports that prices in the shops rose by 3.3% over the last year - the biggest jump since March 2012. The figures also show that people spent 0.5% less in the shops in September than in August [this survey tracks the volume of sales, and the value] Kate Davies, ONS Senior Statistician explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales saw a monthly decline of 0.8%, reversing August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. However, there is a continuation of the underlying trend of steady growth in sales volumes following a weak start to the year, and a background of generally rising prices. These increased costs are reflected in the more rapid growth in the amount spent when compared with the quantity bought.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction to follow.... The New Zealand dollar has more than 1% since the left-leaning Labour Party won the battle to form the next government. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are all falling this morning, failing to take much comfort from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales gloom has helped to pull the FTSE 100 down by 41 points. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market is being pulled down by the Catalonia crisis, with signs that Madrid is about to impose direct rule... The US stock market is also expected to fall, when it opens in five hours time. Back in the City, shares in consumer giant Unilever have fallen by 3.5% after the company disappointed investors today. Unilever CEO Paul Polman blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poorer weather in Europe and natural disasters in the Americas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a slowdown in underlying sales growth, to 2.6% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 3% earlier this year, and well below forecasts of 3.9% growth. The company warned: Overall market conditions have remained challenging. In the markets in which we operate volumes were flat in aggregate. We are seeing some early signs of improving conditions in emerging markets. Icecream sales came off the boil, apparently: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official growth rate over the last five years is very consistent.... Finnish economist Iikka Korhonen suggests that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate is suspiciously consistent, despite remarkable volatility in business spending, factory output and retail sales. Trading Economics flag up that spending on new offices, factories and machinery is slowing. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Haidi Lun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brought her best GIF game to work today.... Financial experts are often sceptical about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, arguing that they could be manipulated by officials to produce a number to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liking. But on face value, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 GDP report looks fairly impressive. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the annual growth rate of 6.8% was bang in line with forecasts, and above Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 6.5% growth this year. Property Sales finally showed some signs of slowing in response to the curbs, and while govt spending on infrastructure and some inventory building were key contributors to growth, it is also increasingly obvious that the Services sector (particularly the tech sector) is increasingly becoming a, if not the, primary driver of growth, i.e. signalling that the economy is actually rebalancing. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has shrugged off fears of a sharp slowdown, by notching up another quarter of solid growth. Chinese GDP rose by an annual rate of 6.8% in July to September, new figures from Beijing show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly down on the 6.9% recorded earlier this year, but means China is well on track to beat the official target of growth around 6.5%. This suggests that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive to puncture property speculation and drain its shadow banking sector aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t derailing the economy. The figures come at a good time, as the Chinese communist party is holding its five-yearly congress. Yesterday, president Xi declared boldly that China was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moving closer to centre stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a new era. He spoke about curbing financial risks, encouraging innovation and increasing consumer spending, as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic rebalancing continues. Xi also hinted that people should stop seeking a quick buck (yen?) in the property market, declaring that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Houses are for living, not for speculating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A lesson for us all there..... New figures today also show that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fixed-asset investment slowed in September, but retail sales picked up. Industrial output rose by 6.6% per year, up from 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of economic data and political drama to get our teeth into today. In the UK, the latest retail sales figures will show whether consumers kept spending last month. Economists predict a 0.1% monthly fall, as people tighten their belts as the cost of living rises. On an annual basis, retail sales growth is expected to drop to 2.1%, from 2.4% in August. Following Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in inflation, and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures, this is another important healthcheck on the UK economy. Consumer spending has been a key driver of UK growth recently, so any pull back could be a concern. RBC Capital Markets say the figures could help determine whether the Bank of England raises interest rates next month: After a strong August in both value and volume terms, led by non-food stores, the market is looking for somewhat of a pull-back this time in expecting a month-on-month decline in volumes. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects a small decline in spending: With Christmas coming it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too much of a surprise if we were to see a pause in the September numbers. Expectations are for a slowdown from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1% rise to no change or a slightly negative reading of -0.1, as Q3 comes to an end. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots of political drama around the globe today. New Zealand has a new prime minister, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacinda Ardern, ending several weeks of uncertainty: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline day for Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Carles Puigdemont to decide whether to withdraw his declaration of independence. Madrid could impose direct rule if Puigdemont doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down. European leaders are heading to Brussels tonight for a summit where Theresa May hopes to unlock the deadlock in the Brexit negotations. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little sign that the EU will decide that enough progress has been made over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divorce bill.... The news bucket is overflowing with corporate news too; consumer goods group Unilever, pest control firm Rentokil, and the London Stock Exchange are all reporting results. The LSE has also announced that CEO Xavier Rolet is stepping down at the end of next year.

It now expects to make \u00c2\u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure.</p> <p>The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p.</p> <p>The company said sales had stalled in the summer. It now expects the new car market to continue to decline this year and into the first half of next year. Its chief executive Trevor Finn blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waning demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from consumers coupled with oversupply from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manufacturers with ambitious objectives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a very strong first quarter, a good second quarter and then demand waned ... in the big selling month of September and run-up to it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. September is a key month for car sales because number plates change. In the first six months of 2017, Pendragon made a profit of \u00c2\u00a348.5m, up 9.7% from a year earlier....</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/23/shares-in-uks-biggest-car-dealer-pendragon-fall-by-17\">Shares in UK's biggest car dealer Pendragon fall by 17%</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59edf651b5ca4a0780585017\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-23T14:10:17.931Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in: Eurozone consumer confidence has risen again - a sharp contrast with the UK today.</strong></p> <p>Figures from the European Commission show that consumer morale beat forecasts this month, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery continued.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ecfin/status/922464302661070848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oct. 2017, flash estimate of consumer confidence indicator remained broadly flat in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/euroarea?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#euroarea</a> &amp; unchanged in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EU</a> \u011f\u0178\u2018\u2030 <a href=\"https://t.co/6xwEOqBGww\">https://t.co/6xwEOqBGww</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ia8qJWF4pw\">pic.twitter.com/ia8qJWF4pw</a></p>&mdash; EU Economy&amp;Finance (@ecfin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecfin/status/922464302661070848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Curiously, the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone consumer confidence index was still in negative territory, rising from -1.2 in September to -1.0 this month.

                "bodyText":"And finally... Pendragon have ended the day a whopping 18% down, at a four-year low. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning has gone down very badly with the City, with traders unimpressed that the firm will only make \u00c2\u00a360m this year, not the \u00c2\u00a375m previously expected. David Madden of CMC Markets comments: The company announced that weak consumer demand has led to a drop in the number of people looking to purchase new cars. Pendragon anticipates the weakness in the new car market to remain until mid-2018. Shares in Pendragon have been in decline since January 2016, and the gap lower adds to the negative sentiment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some scepticism that things will pick up next year.... However, the wider market reaction is rather muted. The FTSE 100 ended the day up one point, or 0.02% at 7524. The pound is a little higher against the US dollar tonight too, at $1.321, despite the latest warning signs from the UK factory sector. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks and reading and commenting. GW Right, time for a round-up on the Pendragon profits warning, from my colleague Julia Kollewe... Shares in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car dealer have plunged by 17% after a surprise profit warning which also raised new fears over consumer spending. The alert from Pendragon, which trades under the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone fascias, and sold 159,000 used cars last year, is the latest in a raft of profit warnings issued in recent weeks by UK companies blaming worsening consumer confidence. Pendragon, which sells all the main marques, said demand for new cars was sliding and the market had peaked. It now expects to make \u00c2\u00a360m of underlying pretax profits this year, down sharply from a previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a375m, which was similar to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. The shares plunged 23% in early trading and later traded 17% lower at 23.74p. The company said sales had stalled in the summer. It now expects the new car market to continue to decline this year and into the first half of next year. Its chief executive Trevor Finn blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waning demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from consumers coupled with oversupply from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manufacturers with ambitious objectives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a very strong first quarter, a good second quarter and then demand waned ... in the big selling month of September and run-up to it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. September is a key month for car sales because number plates change. In the first six months of 2017, Pendragon made a profit of \u00c2\u00a348.5m, up 9.7% from a year earlier.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Just in: Eurozone consumer confidence has risen again - a sharp contrast with the UK today. Figures from the European Commission show that consumer morale beat forecasts this month, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery continued. Curiously, the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone consumer confidence index was still in negative territory, rising from -1.2 in September to -1.0 this month. The long-term average for this index is minus 10 in the euro area. Analyst firm Langton Capital is also worried that profit warnings could accelerate in the next few months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?! Over in New York, the US stock market has hit new record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq indices all struck new record levels at th start of trading. Traders are citing relief about last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Japanese election, which delivered a large win for prime minister Shinzo Abe. That means investors can can look forward to more money-printing and record low interest rates under Abenomics. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform plan has also been driving shares higher, even though experts warn that most of the benefits will go to the richest Americans. I mentioned earlier that UK profit warnings have jumped sharply, from 45 per quarter to 75. Well, the bad news is this trend will probably get worse if the British economy keeps slowing and Brexit talks keep stumbling, according to Pierre Bose of Credit Suisse. Reuters has the details: Pierre Bose, head of European equity strategy at Credit Suisse said more profit warnings from UK companies were to be expected if the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth continued to deteriorate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need results on the Brexit talks because from a corporate perspective, for investment spending, you need better clarity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. In a note, Credit Suisse said that despite the UK market benefiting from a global cyclical upturn, it faces significant economic and political challenges. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy news today, says Simon English in the Evening Standard. He writes: A hefty profit warning from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car dealer sent shares crashing nearly 20% and raised fears about the state of one of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important industries. Pendragon alarmed the market and City analysts with a sudden admission that too many cars are being made and consumer confidence has stalled. In The Times (\u00c2\u00a3), Robert Lea points out that Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits will be 20% lower than expected this year: Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest motor retailer went sharply into reverse after Pendragon finally admitted that it had been caught up in the decline in new car sales. The company, which trades under its Stratstone and Evans Halshaw showrooms, reported that profits this year will come in at about \u00c2\u00a360 million, nearly a fifth lower than last year. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Martin flags up (\u00c2\u00a3) that Pendragon is planning changes to halt its sales slide. The group said it is experiencing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the premium sector \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caused by certain manufacturers continuing to force vehicles into the market despite softening demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. CEO Trevor Finn set out steps that he hopes will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerate transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, including looking for a senior hire in the UK, considering a pullback from premium brands, and halting any new acquisitions in the US. It hints that it may pull out of the US altogether. The City analysts who track Pendragon have been pulling some screeching handbrake turns since its profits warning came out. Berenberg have lowered their recommendation for the stock to hold, from buy, and cut the price target from 46p to 26p. Canaccord Genuity have also cut their price target to 26p, from 36p. All perfectly understandable, but a little late - as Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by a sixth this morning, from 29p to 24p..... Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning is also fuelling fears that stocks of unsold cars in the UK are building up to dangerous levels. Accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young warned earlier this month that car dealers are sitting on 16% more unsold stock than they were just a year ago. The total of new cars gathering dust is now worth \u00c2\u00a327.3bn, up from \u00c2\u00a323.6bn last year. That helps to explain why Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial performance has deteriorated, as this big stockpile will put pressure on dealers Paul Daly, Partner at UHY Hacker Young, blamed auto manufacturers for pumping more new cars into the market, even though demand is slowing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Car makers continue to push more and more vehicles on to dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 books, but that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on indefinitely. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsustainable for unsold stock to keep rising so quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says chancellor Philip Hammond must help Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To boost investment growth, Government should use the Budget to provide a fillip for factories through business rate reforms, including exempting new plant and machinery from rates altogether, and switching to the more recognized CPI inflation measure rather RPI when calculating upratings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how UK firms are hunkering down and resisting buying new buildings: The recent slowdown in UK factory growth could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. So argues Simon French of Panmure Gordon: NEWSFLASH: UK factory order growth has slowed, and bosses are gloomier about future prospects. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey of British manufacturing, just released by the CBI (which represents UK business leaders). It found that optimism about business conditions fell in the last quarter, for the first time in a year. Worryingly, the survey found that growth in output, domestic orders and export orders also eased over the last three months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: 29% of businesses reported an increase in total orders, and 23% a decrease, giving a balance of +6%. Both domestic orders (+5%) and export orders (+12%) grew at a slower pace, albeit remaining above their long-run averages (-4% and -6% respectively) The CBI also found that companies are planning to cut back on investing in new equipment, and are also worried that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll struggle to find new staff. Investment intentions for the year ahead deteriorated, with spending plans for buildings at their lowest since July 2009. Expectations for spending on new equipment also weakened. Plans for investment in training and innovation remained much firmer by comparison. Concerns over labour shortages edged up from already high levels, with the number of respondents citing them as a limitation to investment plans at the highest since October 2013. Vertem Asset Management have summed up the situation... The slew of profit warnings from UK firms this autumn is becoming a serious concern. Too many companies, both big and small, have shocked the City in recent weeks by suddenly revealing unexpected problems - or a surprise deterioration in trading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of some of the gloom from this month alone: Merlin Entertainment, the theme park operator which owns Legoland and Madame Tussauds, warned that it experienced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It blamed recent terror attacks in the UK for scaring off customers, as it cut its profit expectations. Serviced office provider IWG saw a third wiped off its value last week after warning that sale were weaker than expected. A slowdown in London was partly to blame. Engineering firm GKN slashed its profit forecasts, due to problems at its US aerospace arm and two unexpected legal claims. Interserve, the construction and support services company, issued its second profit warning since the summer. The firm, whose public sector contracts include monitoring prisoners on probation, also warned it could breach its banking covenants Last week, The Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick Hoskins wrote that the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153duffers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 corner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is getting crowded, adding: It was only a few months ago that Britain was celebrating a seven-year low in the number of profit warnings. That benign period feels well and truly over. The incompetent and the unlucky are now having to fess up. And the share market is grumpily intolerant of any deviation from plan. Share prices are getting thumped. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that the car industry is facing some fundamental changes - from self-driving vehicles to a renewed clampdown on pollution. My colleague John Harris has written a good column on this issue today, which will not bring much cheer to Pendragon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: After a century in which the car has sat at the heart of industrial civilisation, the age of the automobile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of mass vehicle ownership, and the idea (in the western world at least) that life is not complete without your own set of wheels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looks to be drawing to a close. Top Gear is a dead duck. No one writes pop songs about Ferraris any more. The stereotypical boy racer appears a hopeless throwback. And in our cities, the use of cars is being overtaken by altogether greener, more liberating possibilities. The sale of diesel and petrol cars is to be outlawed in the UK from 2040. But only 10 days ago Oxford announced that it is set to be the first British city to ban all petrol and diesel cars and vans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from a handful of central streets by 2020, extending to the entire urban centre 1o years later. Paris will ban all non-electric cars by 2030, and is now in the habit of announcing car-free days on which drivers have to stay out of its historic heart. In the French city of Lyon, car numbers have fallen by 20% since 2005, and the authorities have their sights set on another drop of the same magnitude. London, meanwhile, has shredded the idea that rising prosperity always triggers rising car use, and seen a 25% fall in the share of journeys made by car since 1990..... Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning has prompted traders to dump the stock, says David Madden of CMC Markets. So, after their early plunge, Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still down almost 17% today at a four-year low. Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning is the latest in a series of blows to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector. So far this month, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned that: New car sales in the UK plunged by 9% in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sixth monthly fall in a row, leaving the market on course for its first annual decline since 2011. Vauxhall is cutting 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant in the North West of England. One in four workers will be laid off, as demand for its Astra drops. PSA Group, the French company which owns Vauxhall, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to new investment until Brexit negotiations have advanced. Spending across the UK car industry is on course to halve this year. The Mail on Sunday reported yesterday that just \u00c2\u00a3647m has been invested since the start of 2017, down from \u00c2\u00a31.66bn in 2016. Profit warnings are, by their nature, unexpected. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update from Pendragon is a particular surprise, as the company sounded so upbeat less than three months ago. Back on August 1st, Pendragon declared that it had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a clear path for growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after growing its underlying profits by almost 10% in the first half of 2017. Clearly, the summer and early autumn have been much more challenging than it expected. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning (online here) shows that Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new car business suffered at 20% fall in gross profits in the third quarter of this year. And with sales expected to keep falling into early 2018, it will take some time until profitability picks up again. Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used cars business has also suffered a 20% plunge in gross profits, due to the knock-on effect of the slowdown in the new car business. It says: This price correction, which was primarily focussed on some premium brands and therefore affected our Stratstone business, was a reaction to significant numbers of cars being registered and then sold into the market at significant discounts. This practice drives down the value of younger cars in the market and nearly new inventories (eg dealer demonstrators and loan cars). City analysts are now demanding answers.... Shares in Inchcape, a rival car dealership,have fallen by 4% in early trading. That shows that traders believe Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are part of a wider malaise in the UK economy. The City of London is most unimpressed by Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent performance, says retail analyst Nick Bubb: The profit warning from the normally bullish Pendragon group will go down like a lead balloon in the City today and put pressure on the other Motor dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are on track for their worst day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in eight and a half-year, says Reuters. Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning is the latest sign of weakness in the UK economy, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. He writes: British car dealership chain Pengdragon plunged nearly 20% after warning on full-year profit, the company struggling with the declining demand for new cars and the impact this has had on the used car market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign of retail-woe in the UK, especially among companies dealing with big ticket items, as the household spending squeeze continues. The Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City expert, Simon English, is aghast at Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning: In another surprise development....Pendragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Mel Egglenton, has stepped down for personal reasons, with immediate effect. The company has appointed Chris Chambers, the senior independent director, to replace him. Shares in Pendragon have plunged by almost 20% at the start of trading. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slumped to their lowest level in over four years, as investors react to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning from the car dealer. Pendragon, the UK car dealership firm, has sent a shiver through the City this morning by issuing a profits warning. The company, which runs the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone outlets, says that demand for new cars has slumped in recent months, driving down the value of second-hand cars as well. Pendragon, which is one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest dealers, blames a fall in consumer confidence. It told shareholders that: The decline in demand for new cars and the consequent used car price correction has impacted this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit outturn..... During the quarter as consumer confidence waned we experienced significant market pressures. Pendragon, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest listed car dealer, now expects to post full year underlying pre-tax profits of just \u00c2\u00a360m, down from expectations of around \u00c2\u00a375m. Official figures have shown that UK car sales have been falling for the last six months, as people have cut back on big-ticket items. Pendragon fears that this trend will continue: In the premium sector we have experienced unprecedented pressure on new vehicle margin caused by certain manufacturers continuing to force vehicles into the market despite softening demand. We expect new car registrations to continue to reduce for the remainder of this year and into next year with the volume franchise reductions easing first, followed by a normalisation of the registrations of premium vehicles. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy news from Pendragon is the latest in a series of profit warnings. UK-listed businesses have issued 75 profit warnings in the last quarter, up from 45 between April and June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest quarterly rise in nearly six years, according to accountancy firm EY. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, when the CBI issues its monthly industrial trends report. Last month, the survey showed that manufacturing was holding up well, with output growing and exports \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Political drama could also move the markets today, as the Catalonia crisis rumbles on. The ball is back in the Catalan parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court, after the Spanish government in Madrid triggered 155 of the Spanish constitution, imposing direct rule. Could Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia, respond by declaring independence?... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more stability in Japan, where Shinzo Abe is celebrating a general election win. Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito have retained their super-majority, sending the Japanese Nikkei rallying, for its 15th day in a row - a new record. This means that Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abenomics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd growth strategy, based around ultra-loose monetary policy, will probably continue. He is also expected to try to reform Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitution, including its pacifist Article 9 which limits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces to self-defence. European markets are expected to open cautiously: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 11am: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bundesbank releases its monthly report. 11am: CBI industrial trends report for October. 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence report",

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed higher - but Spain has bucked the trend as the Catalan crisis escalates further. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is still under negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Far from being a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ceiling of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1bn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would characterize last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amazon September results as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPicasso-like quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, as it shows America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the last quarter came from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rate hike is fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Kohl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad sales. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s durables release). Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet day... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.15am BST: Peter Praet, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, speaks a a conference on financial market policy in Frankfurt. 1.30pm BST: US GDP report released.",

Eric Wiegand, the senior portfolio manager at US Bank Private Wealth Management, told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While valuations are full, it certainly becomes imperative on them to deliver solid operating results and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that we did see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon shares jumped more than 11% in early dealings on Wall Street, with third quarter revenues up 34% to $43.7bn, helped by its recent purchase of the Whole Foods Markets chain. Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price added nearly 8% as investors welcomed news of a 12% rise in revenues to $24.5bn, better than the expected $23.56bn. Adding to the technology bonanza was Alphabet, which saw revenues jump 24% to $27.8bn, with stronger than expected advertising sales at Google and a strong performance from YouTube. Concerns about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant market position have yet to hit its financial results, and the shares rose about 6%. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rise added nearly $9bn to the value of the 17% stake in the business owned by chief executive Jeff Bezos. The rise took his total wealth to about $92.5bn and allowed him to overtake Microsoft founder Bill Gates as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man. Gates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gain on Friday amounted to about $550m, taking his wealth to $88.5bn, although he has given away much of his fortune to charity. This is the second time Bezos has become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man. In July, hopes for positive second quarter figures from Amazon lifted the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares and briefly pushed Bezos above Gates in the rankings. But the results disappointed investors , Amazon shares fell back and Gates regained his crown. This time Amazon has outperformed expectations, with net earnings at $256m or 52 cents a share, well above the forecasts of just three cents. As well as the boost from Whole Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 grocery sales, Amazon benefited from its Prime Day promotion in the summer. After the results, Credit Suisse raised its target price for Amazon shares from $1,350 to $1,385. But the effects of Amazon continuing to win business from older retailers reliant on physical stores was shown by a profit warning from department store JC Penney. Its shares dropped 17% after it said it was forced to sell off unwanted inventory at discount prices and warned it no longer expected an increase in full-year sales. Microsoft, as part of its revival under chief executive Satya Nadella, has focused on its cloud computing business to offset flagging sales of its Windows software. Revenues from the cloud business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which includes products such as Office 365 - rose 14%, while the personal computers division slipped 0.2%. Microchip maker Intel, up 5% after its results, and Twitter, 4% higher following slightly better than expected revenues, also added to the buoyant mood in the sector. Apple, which saw strong demand for its iPhone X on its first day of sales on Friday, added 2% ahead of results next week. Facebook, which also reports next week, rose 3%. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up only 0.1%, weighed down by disappointing results from oil company Chevron and a downbeat report from pharmaceuticals business Merck, which suffered disruption to its business after a cyber attack earlier in the year. The Dow was also undermined by the dollar strengthening in the wake of a higher than expected third quarter GDP figure, adding to belief that the US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting. In Europe, most markets ended higher, thanks to weakness in the euro after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting indicated a gradual reduction in its bond buying programme. But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex dropped more than 1% after the Catalan government controversially declared independence following the 1 October referendum.",

She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a country that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-property\">taxes British residents</a>, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">overheated housing market</a>. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police\">holds UK property in offshore companies</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/egregious-loophole-property-capital-gains-tax-close-foreign-owners-commercial\">This egregious tax loophole costs the UK \u00c2\u00a38bn every year.

We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly.</li> <li>Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment.</li> <li>The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc.</li> <li>We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast.

This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income.</p> <p>Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding).

                "bodyText":"In an uncertain day ahead of a busy week, the Spanish stock market bucked the trend and jumped sharply on hopes that the Catalan independence crisis could be resolved. A positive set of GDP numbers for the country also helped sentiment. Elswhere the FTSE 100 slipped lower, as its overseas earners reacted badly to a stronger pound, which moved higher ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting where the first interest rise in a decade is widely expected. On Wall Street the latest developments in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election saw markets slip back. There was also talk that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long awaited tax reforms may only be gradual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00c2\u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmonth/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153head for the exits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial price declines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primary driver of inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally, a chart showing why \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash for clunkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery weak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit by \u00c2\u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent growth figures this morning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00c2\u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00c2\u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00c2\u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpreadsheet Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 and 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchypothecated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given all the current pressures and uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the policy action that these might require \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasingly intense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very tricky hand indeed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. The \u00c2\u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00c2\u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00c2\u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00c2\u00a370 billion) in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00c2\u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit is on track to still be \u00c2\u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as much as the \u00c2\u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwriggle room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",

While the economic consequences of these developments have yet to emerge, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic data were positive. In third-quarter 2017, GDP growth remained robust at 0.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest level since 2008.

                "bodyText":"Positive eurozone economic data in the form of strong third quarter growth figures and falling unemployment meant a fairly positive end to the month for European equities. Most markets managed to close higher, although Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was closed for a public holiday. In the US, investors were more focused on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting than upbeat consumer confidence figures, but Wall Street still managed to make slight gains after an uncertain start. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.27 points or 0.07% at 7493.08 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.18% better at 5503.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was up 0.18% at 22,793.69 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.74% better at 10,523.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.12% to 759.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 17 points or 0.08%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The continuing dispute between Spain and Catalan separatists should have no immediate effect on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign debt ratings, says S&amp;P Global. The agency said that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly application of Article 155 [removing Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional government from office] and the frontloading of regional elections have reduced the likelihood of a short-term escalation of tensions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said it did not believe Catalan independence would take place: As we expected, no national government has recognized Catalonia as an independent state. The most prominent credit risk we continue to see is that the related tensions could lead to a sustained drop in business and consumer confidence and potential business disruption from fourth-quarter 2017 onward, especially in Catalonia. While the economic consequences of these developments have yet to emerge, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic data were positive. In third-quarter 2017, GDP growth remained robust at 0.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest level since 2008. This confirms our expectation of Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong economic performance. US markets are more focused on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting than the positive data we have seen today. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite a very good afternoon for data the Dow Jones and dollar were reticent to do much this Tuesday, investors holding back ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed statement. The CB consumer confidence reading smashed expectations, coming in at 125.9 against the 121.1 forecast and the 120.6 seen in September (itself revised higher from the initial estimate). The Chicago PMI was also pretty muscular; at 66.2 it hit its best level in around 3 years. Yet off the back of these numbers the Dow Jones could only rise 0.1%, while the greenback actually fell 0.3% against the pound. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely because investors are a bit nervy ahead of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting. While a December hike seems pretty much locked on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the CME Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FedWatch tool pointing to a 98.2% chance of a rate rise in the festive month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the market will still be looking for a firmly hawkish statement from Janet Yellen on Wednesday. Elsewhere the FTSE saw its daily gains shrink to just 0.1% as the afternoon wore on, leaving the index once again the wrong side of 7500. Sterling, on the other hand, stretched its legs against the euro, doubling its growth to 0.4%, while cable climbed back above $1.325, as investors continue to focus on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE rate vote. Over in Greece, and there is some good news for the country from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone jobs figures. Helena Smith reports: Greek unemployment dropped to 21 % in July [the latest data available] according to the European statistics agency (Eurostat), with the number of jobless Greeks at 1.01m. Of that number 17.5 % were men and 25.3 percent women, it said. At the height of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis four years ago, unemployment nudged 28 % spurring a massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of qualified Greek abroad. The jobless rate among those under the age of 25 also dropped from 43% in June to 42.8%. Meanwhile, well-placed finance ministry officials say the government is also planning a second foray into the bond market possibly as early as next month, before Greece completes a third bailout review with the international bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. News of the prospective foray, in effect a second test run, would prepare Athens for exit from its current bailout programme which expires in less than a year. Greece successfully put its toe back into bond market for the first time since 2014 in July but analysts insist that real economic recovery will only come when its staggering debt pile is ultimately tackled.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report from Rob Davies: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob on BBC Radio Scotland talking about the issue (from about 49.45). US investors seem to be playing its safe ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite further upbeat trading statements from the likes of Kellogg and Mastercard, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down 0.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite has slipped 0.01%. European markets are generally flat too, although Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up another 0.5% as fears over the Catalan independence threat continue to recede. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax meanwhile is closed for a holiday. On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased to its highest level in almost 17 years (Dec. 2000, 128.6) in October after remaining relatively flat in September. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions improved, boosted by the job market which had not received such favorable ratings since the summer of 2001. Consumers were also considerably more upbeat about the short-term outlook, with the prospect of improving business conditions as the primary driver. Confidence remains high among consumers, and their expectations suggest the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace for the remainder of the year. These positive US figures come as the Federal Reserve holds its latest monetary policy meeting, and while no rise in interest rates is expected this month, all the signs point to an increase in December. (By then we should also know the name of the next Fed chair, with Donald Trump set to announce his appointee sometime this week.) Over in the US, and consumers were more confident than expected in October. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index came in at 125.9, better than the 121 figure forecast by analysts. It was also higher than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 120.6, itself revised upwards from 119.8, and the best level since December 2000. Earlier there were also positive manufacturing figures from Chicago. The purchasing managers index rose from 65.2 in September to 66.2, better than the expected fall to 61. Right, time for a quick recap.... The Eurozone is on track to grow faster than America and the UK this year, after reporting better-than-expected growth figures over the last quarter. Eurozone GDP grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, faster than expected and beating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% growth. On an annual basis, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5% during the last quarter - which is its fastest rate since the first three months of 2011. Economists say the recovery seems to be strengthening. In another boost, the eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.9%, as the expanding economy helped people to find work. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, says British businesses should look for growth opportunities in the euro area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is easy for businesses to fall into the trap of over-cautiousness when the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own growth rate is slower, but capitalising on Eurozone successes now will help companies to secure their future. Businesses can and should be doing as much as they can to drive up productivity and activity through positive investment in both people and assets, taking advantage of positive economic conditions to help them navigate successfully through times of uncertainty, and emerge in a position of strength.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The day began with solid growth figures from France, which grew by 0.5% during the last quarter. Like the wider eurozone, France racked up its best annual growth since the early days of the euro debt crisis (when Greece was being bailed out and the Italian government was faltering). It grew by 2.2% compared with Q3 2016, while the UK only grew by 1.5% over the same time. Experts say France moved into a higher gear. Domestic demand drove the growth, with household spending and business investment both up. Austria also had a decent summer, expanding by 0.8%. Canada, though, seems to be slowing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDO shrank by 0.1% in August, after stagnating in July. Hello..... sterling is suddenly pushing higher against the euro. The pound has gained almost 0.5% against the single currency to a one-month high of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. This follows reports that the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, ha said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to speed up negotiations with the UK. Newsflash: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy unexpectedly contracted, a little, in August. Canadian GDP shrank by 0.1% in August, due to a decline in mining and manufacturing output. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good-producing sector shrank by 0.7% during August, wiping out a 0.1% rise in service sector output. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.1% in August, having been flat in July as the strong growth recorded earlier this year has faded. Unless something remarkable happened in September, Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 growth rate is going to struggle to match other advanced economies. That has hurt the Canadian dollar, which is now falling against the US dollar. High street retailer John Lewis has fuelled worries about UK consumer spending, by posting its fifth weekly fall in sales in a row. Takings at John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores fell by 4.0% year-on-year in the seven days to Saturday 28th October. That includes a 1.9% drop in fashion sales, and a 7% slump in sales of electronics and home technology. Last week, the CBI warned that retailers were reporting the biggest drop in demand since the recession.... Not only is the eurozone enjoying faster growth than Britain, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also experiencing less inflation. The consumer prices index, which tracks the cost of living, rose by just 1.4% per annum this month, according to new data released this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 1.5% in September. In contrast, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate hit 3% in September, and the Bank of England expects it kept rising in October. So with inflation down, unemployment down and growth up, the eurozone does look rather healthier than a few years ago: It may be Halloween, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing scary in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone growth figures, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index: Eurozone growth is pretty broad-based right now, adding weight to the argument that the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is well entrenched. Spain, for all of its political woes related to Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for independence, posted a 3.1% GDP rate for Q3, while France saw growth beat expectations and reach 2.2% for last quarter. We are still waiting to hear about growth rates in other major nations such as Germany and Italy, if they can post rates around this level then the mood music in Brussels is likely to be good. The eurozone economy is benefitting from strong domestic demand, thanks to record low interest rates, says Raj Badiani, director at IHS Markit: Households are experiencing a more supportive climate, characterized by still-cheap credit, while lower-than-expected inflation rates have limited the anticipated squeeze on household purchasing power during second and third quarters. Additionally, still-rising employment and a retreating unemployment rate have lifted both household confidence and spending across the region in the first three quarters of 2017. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve plotted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth figures alongside the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own GDP figures, to show how Europe powered ahead this year. The long-awaited fall in eurozone unemployment is helping to drive growth this year, says Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ulster Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists say the eurozone recovery is stronger than expected: Ben Chu of the Independent shows how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate overtook the UK a year ago: Philip Shaw of Investec thinks the eurozone could outpace America this year, as well as the UK. (last week we learned that US GDP grew by 2.3% over the last 12 months, so a little slower than the eurozone). The eurozone has just posted its fastest annual growth rate since the beginning of the debt crisis, partly due to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance. That means the eurozone has outpaced Britain this year, as UK GDP only expanded by 1.5% over the last 12 months (as explained at 7.32am). Breaking! The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stronger reading than expected. In another boost, growth in the second quarter has been revised up to 0.7%, from 0.6%. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 2.5% -- a healthy rate, which underlines that the European economy has enjoyed quite a sparkling 2017. The latest unemployment figures also show an improvement -- the euro area jobless rate has dropped to 8.9% for September, the lowest since the start of 2009. Newsflash: Fashion chain Burberry have just announced that its chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, is leaving. Thats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only three months since Bailey relinquished the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair to Marco Gobbetti, a move that was meant to allow Bailey to focus on creative matters. Bailey has received wide acclaim over the years for transforming Burberry into a global fashion house, so this could be a blow to the company. As chairman Sir John Peace puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christopher is a unique talent and an exceptional person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who has worked as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great partner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the firm. Shareholders may be concerned. Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 2% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard..... In other news, the UK government has outlined its plans to protect gamblers from fixed-odds betting terminals. Under the plan, the maximum bet could be cut from \u00c2\u00a3100 to just \u00c2\u00a32 (or possibly to \u00c2\u00a350, which seems rather less radical).... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart, which suggests France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has shifted into a higher gear: Barclays economics team agree, saying: We think the French economy is poised to grow solidly next year, projecting 1.9% (consensus: 1.7%), with investment likely to provide increasing support to private consumption, the main growth engine. Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global chief investment strategist, is concerned that the UK is lagging behind other advanced economies such as France. He believes Brexit uncertainty is weighing the economy down, meaning Britain faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctough slog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Turnill says: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muted growth outlook stands in stark contrast to 2016, when the UK sat close to the top of G7 growth charts alongside Germany. Brexit negotiations in particular are weighing on the UK economy. Significant progress on three key issues is needed for discussions to move on to the post-Brexit trade relationship between the UK and European Union (EU): the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial obligations to the EU, and the Irish border. Progress has been made in recent weeks on these issues, but not enough to advance talks, the EU leaders concluded at their recent summit. Reuters have a good first take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French growth figures, for anyone just tuning in: The French economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous three months as consumer spending picked up and investment remained robust, the INSEE national statistics agency said on Tuesday in a first estimate. The result, which was spot in line with a Reuters poll of 27 analysts, meant gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 2.2% over a year, the fastest pace of growth since 2011. Upward revisions in the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year - both by 0.1 percentage point to 0.6% - gave a growth carry-over of 1.7%, the performance for 2017 if growth was zero in the final quarter. Following the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over the first nine months, President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government should have little trouble surpassing the 1.7% growth forecast it built its budget plans on. Barclays have also hailed France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth performance: Newsflash: Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of this year. That matches the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the second quarter, and is a pretty decent result. It means Austria is growing as fast as Spain (and rather faster than both France and the UK). WIFO, the think tank which compiled the report, says the recovery is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad-based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with foreign trade and domestic demand both growing. On an annual basis, Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is motoring along nicely with 2.6% growth. Holder Sandte, economist at Nordea Markets, believes France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic economy strengthened over the summer: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is fresh confirmation that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has outperformed the UK this year French GDP grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017, then 0.6% in Q2, and then 0.5% in Q3. In contrast, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only expanded by 0.3% in the first and second quarters of this year, rising to 0.4% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate, at 2.2%, is so much better than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.5%. INSEE says that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate, of 2.2%, is the strongest since 2011 -- when the eurozone debt crisis was exploding. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Deen is impressed by France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over the last year: Economist Fred Ducrozet, of Swiss bank Pictet, agrees that the recovery is on track: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics reckons that Paris is now going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoe to toe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Berlin in the growth stakes: (reminder, we get German GDP on 14th November) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that French household spending accelerated in the last three months, from 0.3% to 0.5%. Businesses also kept spending on new machinery and equipment; \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rose by 0.8% during the quarter. Inventory changes also boosted growth,as firms stocked up on new raw materials and components. But, foreign trade was a drag on growth. Imports accelerated sharply (+2.5% after +0.2%) while exports decelerated significantly (+0.7% after +2.3%). INSEE says that France imported more transport equipment during the quarter, but sold fewer manufacturing goods abroad. BREAKING: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fifth quarter of growth in a row, as the French recovery continues to gather pace. Consumer spending and business investment drove French growth during the quarter, says statistics body INSEE. In another boost for president Emmanuel Macron, the growth rate in the second quarter of 2017 has been revised up to 0.6%, from 0.5%. The French economy has grown by 2.2% over the last 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest annual growth rate since 2011, I think.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also rather stronger than the UK, which only grew by 1.5% over the last 12 months (and 0.4% in the third quarter). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull details and reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European politicians and top officials will be hoping to avoid any Halloween shocks today, as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy comes under the microscope. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone GDP day, when we find out how fast Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continued in the third quarter of 2017. Economists predict that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth rate dipped to 0.5% in Q3, from the almost-boisterous 0.6% recorded in April-June. If so, that would beat the UK, which grew by 0.4% in the same period. As well as the headline eurozone growth figure, at 10am GMT, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting data from France and Austria. Alas, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until next month for other heavyweights like Germany and Italy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen some signs that Europe did well in the third quarter - yesterday, Spain posted 0.8% growth in the last three months. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all.... we also get new eurozone inflation and unemployment figures this morning. This splurge of data should give us a good picture of how the economy is faring. Later today, Canada also posts growth figures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also going to be a busy morning for airline news, with budget operator Ryanair and manufacturer Airbus both reporting results. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are expected to open fairly flat, as traders watch for political drama in America following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictments of three of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former aides: October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good month for shares, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Despite the fallout from a new series of political surprises across Europe, the Teflon rally that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen since the beginning of the year shows no signs of slowing down apart from the occasional pause, with markets across Europe set to post significant gains in another good month for stocks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for the third quarter of 2017 8am GMT: Austrian GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone flash inflation rate for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for September 12.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP for August",
