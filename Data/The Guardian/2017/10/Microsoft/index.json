                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed higher - but Spain has bucked the trend as the Catalan crisis escalates further. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u2019s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u2019s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u2019s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u2019s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u2019s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u2013 it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u2019s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u2019s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u2019s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u2019s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u20ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u201cit is still under negotiation.\u201d Far from being a \u20ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u201cceiling of \u20ac1.1bn\u201d Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u2019 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u20ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u2019s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u2019s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u201cThe US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u2019s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u201d Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u2019s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u201cIn spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u2019s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u2019s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u2019s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u201cWe would characterize last night\u2019s Amazon September results as a \u2018Picasso-like quarter\u2019 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u201d \u201cLast night\u2019s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u2019 cap.\u201d Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u2019s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u2019s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u2019s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u2019s GDP report, as it shows America\u2019s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u2019s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u2019s growth in the last quarter came from \u201cpersonal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u201d. But \u201cresidential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u201d both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u2019s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u2019s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u2019s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u2019s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u2019s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u2019s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u2019s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u201cAmericans generally don\u2019t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u201d. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u2019s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u2019s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u2013 a rate hike is fully priced in \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u2013 a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u2019s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u2019s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u2019re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u2019s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u2019t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u201cAlphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u2018phenomenal growth\u2019 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u201cOverall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u2019s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u2019s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u2019s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u2019s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u2019s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u2019s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u2019s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u201ctremendous results\u201d in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u2019s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u201cWe had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u2019s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u2019s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u2019s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u2019s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u2019s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u2019s ad sales. Here\u2019s some reaction to Amazon\u2019s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u2019s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u2019s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u201cThis company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u201d Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u201cThey are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u201d The BBC\u2019s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u2019s according to Marketwatch\u2019s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u2019s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u201cCorporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u2019s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u2019s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u2019s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u2014 but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u2019s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u2019t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u2019s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u2019s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u2019s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u2019s possible that today\u2019s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u2019s durables release). Otherwise it\u2019s a fairly quiet day... Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.15am BST: Peter Praet, the ECB\u2019s chief economist, speaks a a conference on financial market policy in Frankfurt. 1.30pm BST: US GDP report released.",

She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a country that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-property\">taxes British residents</a>, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u2019t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">overheated housing market</a>. It would also generate substantial revenue \u2013 enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u2013 10% of our nation\u2019s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u2013 worth an eye-watering \u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u2013 including most high value property \u2013 is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police\">holds UK property in offshore companies</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/egregious-loophole-property-capital-gains-tax-close-foreign-owners-commercial\">This egregious tax loophole costs the UK \u00a38bn every year.

These problems are continuing.</li> </ul> <p>Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing<br></p> <ul> <li>The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly.</li> <li>Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment.</li> <li>The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u2014poor environment, business, etc.</li> <li>We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018.</li> </ul> <p>Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing </p> <ul> <li>Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business.

Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode.</li> <li>We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year.

Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income.</p> <p>Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u201310 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u201308 (\u20131.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u201308, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u2019t impressed....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JackDromeyMP/status/924904102420676608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">7 years of austerity, 7 years of economic failure, 7 years of the degradation of public services, 7 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Tory</a> years <a href=\"https://t.co/VXI0hAISH5\">https://t.co/VXI0hAISH5</a></p>&mdash; Jack Dromey MP (@JackDromeyMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackDromeyMP/status/924904102420676608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59f6e7e35fb4be0730416621\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-30T08:51:19.003Z\">8.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sign up for our daily email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.</strong></p> <p>Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">You can sign up here</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59f6e1f3833bbe06d81670b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-30T08:35:33.317Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Letwin: Public would accept higher taxer for NHS spending</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/oct/30/uk-budget-deficit-consumer-spending-spain-economy-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-59f6e0665fb4be07304165f9#block-59f6e0665fb4be07304165f9\">as Oliver Letwin says</a>?</em></p> <p><strong>IFS director Paul Johnson</strong> says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u2019ll spend it on the NHS. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u2018hypothecated\u2019 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s just a tax rise to increase spending.</p> </blockquote> <p>Letwin rebuts this.

The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u2019s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u2019s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u2019s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u2019s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u2019 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u2019 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u2019t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u2013 enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u2013 10% of our nation\u2019s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u2013 worth an eye-watering \u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u2013 including most high value property \u2013 is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u2014month/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u2014poor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u2014not great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u2019s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u2019s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u2019s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u2019s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u2019s warning that Britain\u2019s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u2019s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u201chead for the exits\u201d, there could be \u201csubstantial price declines\u201d if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u201cprimary driver of inflation\u201d..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u201d And finally, a chart showing why \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u2019ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u201cIn March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u201d Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u2019s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u2019s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u2018cash for clunkers\u2019 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u2019s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u2019s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u2019t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u2019s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u2019s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u2019t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u2019t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u2018very weak\u2019 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u2019s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u2019s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u2019s deficit by \u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u2019s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u2019s decent growth figures this morning, it\u2019s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u2019s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u2019s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u2019ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u2019t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u2019s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u2019s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u2019t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u2018On\u2019 button). They\u2019re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u2018Spreadsheet Phil\u2019 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u201causterity\u201d have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u2019s why the government\u2019s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u2019s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u2019s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u201308 and 2009\u201310, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u201318 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u201308 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u201310 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u201308 (\u20131.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u201308, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u2019t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u2019ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u2018hypothecated\u2019 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u2019s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u2019s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u2019t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u2019t need \u201chypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u201d, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u2019s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u2019s report on the Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u2019s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u2019s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u2019s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u2019s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u2019t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u2019s \u2018junking\u2019 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u2019m very glad I\u2019m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u2019s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u2019s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u2019s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u2019s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u2019s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u2019s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u201cGiven all the current pressures and uncertainties \u2014 and the policy action that these might require \u2014 it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u201d The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u2019s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u201cincreasingly intense\u201d political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u201cvery tricky hand indeed\u201d, it says. \u201cDoes he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u201d said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u201cPublic sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u2019s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u2019s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u2019s productivity. The \u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u2018weak\u2019 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u2019s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u2018very poor\u2019, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u2018very poor\u2019 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00a370 billion) in 2021\u201322 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u2018giveaway budget\u2019. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u2019s deficit is on track to still be \u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u2019s twice as much as the \u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u2018wriggle room\u2019 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u2019s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u2019s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u2019s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u201cIt is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u201d, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u2019s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u2019s Richard\u2019s full story: I\u2019ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u2013 which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u2019s inflation rate. Here\u2019s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",
