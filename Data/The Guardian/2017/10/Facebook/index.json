When the New Republic, long the house organ of American neoliberalism, runs an article on <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/144492/socialism-america-needs-now\">The Socialism America Needs Now</a>, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that something has fundamentally changed.</p> <p>The soft neoliberalism represented by Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Paul Keating has exhausted its appeal, and not just in the English-speaking world. Throughout Europe, new movements of the left have emerged to challenge or displace social democratic parties discredited by the austerity politics of the last decade.</p> <p>Support for socialism is particularly strong among those under 30, whose economic experience has been dominated by the global financial crisis (GFC) and the subsequent decade of economic stagnation and rising inequality. The most striking example is the recent UK election where Jeremy Corbyn received over 60% of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/ng-interactive/2017/jun/20/young-voters-class-and-turnout-how-britain-voted-in-2017\">votes of those aged 18-25</a>. Similarly in the US, Bernie Sanders drew <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/more-young-people-voted-for-bernie-sanders-than-trump-and-clinton-combined-by-a-lot/?utm_term=.5dff5de79abe\">his most enthusiastic support </a>from the young.</p> <p>For most of the current political class whose ideas were formed in the last decades of the 20th century, the superiority of markets over governments is an assumption so deeply ingrained that it is not even recognised as an assumption. Rather, it is part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153common sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everyone knows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whatever the problem, their answer is the same: lower taxes, privatisation and market-oriented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/02/socialism-young-americans-bernie-sanders\">'The S-word': how young Americans fell in love with socialism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unsurprisingly, people are looking for an alternative, and many are looking back at the postwar decades of widely shared prosperity. Some have turned to the tribalist politics of nostalgia (Make America Great Again, We Want Our Country Back), exemplified in Australia by Pauline Hanson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s One Nation party. </p> <p>But it is already evident that this is a dead end. The disastrous mess being made by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republicans and Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tories is the inevitable result of a politics based on what academic Lionel Trilling described, in the foreword to his essay collection The Liberal Imagination (1950)<em>,</em> as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The dominant advocates of free markets have long derided any kind of government intervention as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socialism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This has been taken to a ludicrous extent recently, the studiously moderate Bill Shorten being described by senior government ministers as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/treasurer-scott-morrison-calls-bill-shorten-red-warns-against-the-new-romantics-of-protectionism-20170830-gy744y.html\">red socialist</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who will turn Australia into the next Cuba. </p> <p>But what do today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resurgent socialists mean by socialism? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier to see what they dislike than to describe a socialist policy agenda. Most obviously, socialism implies an unqualified rejection of the system of financial capitalism (variously called neoliberalism, market liberalism or, in Australia, economic rationalism) that emerged from the economic chaos of the 70s. </p> <p>Neoliberalism has massively enriched the 1%, and particularly the financial sector, while delivering nothing but economic insecurity and stagnant living standards to the great majority of the population.

The combination of strong intellectual property laws and reliance on advertising to finance internet content mean that our access to information is artificially constrained. Governments could address this problem, providing vastly increased access to resources of all kinds, from artistic and cultural content to designs to be used in 3-D printers. </p> <p>But the policies of neoliberal austerity have pushed us in the opposite direction, cutting budgets and pushing public institutions of all kinds towards more reliance on user pricing and advertising.</p> <p>There is also much more room for voluntary and non-government activity. The neoliberal state, through contracting, competitive tendering and the audit culture, has sought to turn voluntary work and non-government organisations into low-cost providers of government services. In the process, much of the creative potential of civil society has been lost. Expanding the scope for voluntary social initiatives would fit naturally with a socialist program, and this is already beginning with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/apr/29/social-enterprise-job-creation\">rise of social enterprises.</a> <em></em></p> <p>The idea of a socialist economy with unconditional access to basic incomes and greatly expanded provision of free services might seem utopian.

It is this fact which explains why conservatives have always used the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socialist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a bogeyman. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also why the term has retained its appeal through decades of neoliberal retrenchment. Social democratic and liberal parties, compromised by their acquiescence in, or embrace of, neoliberalism, need to make a decisive break with the recent past. An explicit embrace of socialism would make that break clear.<br></p>",
                "bodyText":"Socialism is back, much to the chagrin of those who declared it dead and buried at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end of history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the 1990s. When the New Republic, long the house organ of American neoliberalism, runs an article on The Socialism America Needs Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that something has fundamentally changed. The soft neoliberalism represented by Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Paul Keating has exhausted its appeal, and not just in the English-speaking world. Throughout Europe, new movements of the left have emerged to challenge or displace social democratic parties discredited by the austerity politics of the last decade. Support for socialism is particularly strong among those under 30, whose economic experience has been dominated by the global financial crisis (GFC) and the subsequent decade of economic stagnation and rising inequality. The most striking example is the recent UK election where Jeremy Corbyn received over 60% of the votes of those aged 18-25. Similarly in the US, Bernie Sanders drew his most enthusiastic support from the young. For most of the current political class whose ideas were formed in the last decades of the 20th century, the superiority of markets over governments is an assumption so deeply ingrained that it is not even recognised as an assumption. Rather, it is part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153common sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everyone knows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whatever the problem, their answer is the same: lower taxes, privatisation and market-oriented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unsurprisingly, people are looking for an alternative, and many are looking back at the postwar decades of widely shared prosperity. Some have turned to the tribalist politics of nostalgia (Make America Great Again, We Want Our Country Back), exemplified in Australia by Pauline Hanson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s One Nation party. But it is already evident that this is a dead end. The disastrous mess being made by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republicans and Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tories is the inevitable result of a politics based on what academic Lionel Trilling described, in the foreword to his essay collection The Liberal Imagination (1950), as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The dominant advocates of free markets have long derided any kind of government intervention as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socialism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This has been taken to a ludicrous extent recently, the studiously moderate Bill Shorten being described by senior government ministers as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red socialist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who will turn Australia into the next Cuba. But what do today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resurgent socialists mean by socialism? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier to see what they dislike than to describe a socialist policy agenda. Most obviously, socialism implies an unqualified rejection of the system of financial capitalism (variously called neoliberalism, market liberalism or, in Australia, economic rationalism) that emerged from the economic chaos of the 70s. Neoliberalism has massively enriched the 1%, and particularly the financial sector, while delivering nothing but economic insecurity and stagnant living standards to the great majority of the population. This is obvious in the United States, but the same patterns are emerging in market economies throughout the world. More significantly, contemporary socialism repudiates the vaguely humanised capitalism marketed as the third way. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a break with those social democrats and liberals who embraced, or capitulated to, the politics of austerity in the wake of the GFC, such as the New Labour of Blair and Brown, PASOK in Greece and the Dutch Labour party, and, most importantly of all, the Clinton Democrats in the United States. On the other hand, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no detectable enthusiasm for a centrally planned economy like that of the former Soviet Union or Mao\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China. Communism is a distant and discredited memory, even for those old enough to recall the days when it seemed like a possible alternative. As it is used today, the term socialism does not reflect a well-worked ideology. Rather it conveys an attitude that could be described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unapologetic social democracy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or, in the US context, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liberalism with a spine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expressed in support for proposals that break with the cautious incrementalism of the past, and are in some cases frankly utopian: universal basic income, free post-school education, large increases in minimum wages, and so on. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important, but a real alternative needs more than attitude and a grab-bag of policy ideas. After decades in which the focus has been on critiquing neoliberalism, the task of thinking about positive alternatives is urgent, but efforts in this direction are only just beginning. Discussion of economic policy in socialist terms is confined to a handful of small publications, such as Jacobin, a US magazine edited by Bhaskar Sunkara, with notable contributors including Seth Ackerman, Peter Frase and Noam Chomsky. Equally significant has been the resurgence of the left in mainstream economics, represented by Paul Krugman, Thomas Piketty and Joseph Stiglitz. While not explicitly socialist (Krugman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog is called The Conscience of a Liberal) these economists have focused attention on issues of inequality and unemployment, and on progressive policy responses. These are, however, only first steps. To develop a serious socialist alternative, we need both to look backwards to the social democratic moment of the 50s and 60s, and forwards to the prospects for a genuine sharing economy based on the internet and other technological advances. The middle of the 20th century was a unique period of sustained economic growth and broadly shared prosperity in developed market economies. The crucial feature underpinning this success was full employment, guaranteed by Keynesian macroeconomic management. In an economy with full employment, workers are no longer dependent on the goodwill of individual employers or the confidence of business as a whole. If one job does not suit, there is always another. In these circumstances, the distribution of market income between wages and profits, and among wage-earners, tends naturally towards greater equality. Conversely, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen since the 70s, when governments are driven by the need to please financial markets, ever-growing inequality is the inevitable result. The most striking evidence is the rising share of income going to the top 1%, as documented by Piketty and others. The success of Keynesian stimulus in the immediate aftermath of the GFC and the disastrous outcomes from the shift to austerity after 2010 show that Keynesian economic management is as vital as ever. Going beyond crisis management, socialist governments would reinstate the commitment to full employment, and solidify it through policies such as a jobs guarantee, ensuring the availability of a full-time job for anyone who has been unemployed for some minimum period. However, the technological and social changes that have taken place over the past 60 years mean that the traditional notion of full employment, focused on full-time jobs for male breadwinners, is no longer adequate. We need a more flexible approach, accommodating the more diverse patterns of life and work of the 21st century. In this context, the idea of a universal basic income set at a level comparable to the age pension has considerable appeal. The ultimate goal would be to provide an unconditional payment lower than the return from working but sufficient to sustain decent living standards. An interim step, proposed by the late Tony Atkinson in his final book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, would be a participation income available to people who undertook voluntary work to benefit the community. The combination of a job guarantee and a universal basic income would free workers from dependence on employers. But this would only be feasible if society could ensure adequate production of crucial goods and services, without dependence on the wishes of big business. The first step in this regard is to revive a term that was widely used and is still relevant to describe the economy of the mid-20th century: the mixed economy.

The process of privatisation and marketisation was far from complete by the time of the GFC, and large areas of public provision continued. The privatisation movement has produced some successes. Although it was built up under public ownership, Qantas has prospered as a private firm. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious need for a national flag carrier in a competitive airline market. These successes have been more than outweighed by disastrous failures. Recent, but by no means exceptional, Australian examples include the disaster of for-profit vocational education and the comprehensive failure of the national electricity market. The most common outcome of privatisation has been somewhere in between the handful of successes and spectacular failures such as those mentioned. In essence, public monopolies have been replaced by regulated private monopolies and oligopolies. Investors and top managers have done well out of this process, while workers and consumers have lost. The public has long since lost faith in the promise of privatisation and is in fact supportive of re-nationalisation. Yet, as with the labour market, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply revive the mid-20th century economy. First, technological change has radically changed the structure of the economy and society. The central role in the industrial economy of the mid-20th century was played by manufacturing, which took the resources produced by mining and agriculture and transformed them into goods to be distributed through transport, wholesale and retail trade systems to consumers. By contrast, the 21st century economy is dominated by services including health, education and telecommunications, which require different forms of economic organisation. Second, the mid-20th century was a period when economic activity (work for governments or businesses, undertaken for pay or profit in factories, shops and offices) was sharply distinguished from non-economic activity (housework, voluntary activity and non-government organisations). These sharp distinctions are no longer tenable. Thanks to mobile phones and the internet, much paid work is done at home. More importantly, the economic value of the internet as a whole depends entirely on its content, much of which (Facebook and blog posts, Twitter, personal and group websites and so on) is produced by users rather than for economic return. To reimagine a 21st century socialist economy we need to consider a much broader mix of forms of economic activity than those of the 20th century mixed economy. These include: big business small business government businesses public non-market provision not-for profits and NGOs household production Under financial capitalism, the standard way of providing goods and services is through big business: large corporations, with an associated network of subsidiaries and dependent contractors. Big business has grown at the expense of the public sector through privatisation and at the expense of independent small businesses through increased market concentration. At the same time, labour market reforms have reduced the bargaining power of workers and increased that of employers. The combined effects have included increasingly concentrated wealth and power, wage stagnation and slow economic growth. Even the OECD has recognised this. A socialist program would allocate much less economic activity to big business, and more to other forms of organisation.

In part this would imply reversing the neoliberal program of privatisation and marketisation. Large-scale capital intensive activities with limited scope for competition, such as the provision of infrastructure, would be returned to public ownership. We are already seeing the beginnings of this process, with a notable example in the South Australian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment in electricity generation. The Turnbull government denounced South Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies as those of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socialist paradise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, sure to lead to economic disaster. In very short order, however, Turnbull was announcing his own interventions, with the expansion of Snowy Hydro and restrictions on gas exports. We have even seen the suggestion that the commonwealthmight buy the Liddell power station (recently privatised by its state counterparts) to extend its operating life. This is a nonsensical idea, but it illustrates the extent to which the taboo on government intervention has lost its power. Similarly, we are seeing some attempts to reconstruct the public Tafe system after the fiasco of for-profit vocational training and the Fee-Help system. The Victorian government in particular has taken some positive steps. A socialist program in the 21st century needs to involve much more than a reversal of neoliberalism. The internet and the information economy have broken the link between productive activity and market returns. Information is a pure public good, which can be shared again and again with no additional costs. So the production of information (ranging from scientific research to Instagram pictures) has potentially huge social value. On the other hand, the market value of internet activity depends, almost entirely, on the ease with which it can be packaged up with commercial advertising \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning access is artificially constrained. The fact that information is naturally a public good creates a huge potential for economic and social benefits of which we have realised only a small fraction. The combination of strong intellectual property laws and reliance on advertising to finance internet content mean that our access to information is artificially constrained. Governments could address this problem, providing vastly increased access to resources of all kinds, from artistic and cultural content to designs to be used in 3-D printers. But the policies of neoliberal austerity have pushed us in the opposite direction, cutting budgets and pushing public institutions of all kinds towards more reliance on user pricing and advertising. There is also much more room for voluntary and non-government activity. The neoliberal state, through contracting, competitive tendering and the audit culture, has sought to turn voluntary work and non-government organisations into low-cost providers of government services. In the process, much of the creative potential of civil society has been lost. Expanding the scope for voluntary social initiatives would fit naturally with a socialist program, and this is already beginning with the rise of social enterprises. The idea of a socialist economy with unconditional access to basic incomes and greatly expanded provision of free services might seem utopian. But in the aftermath of neoliberal failure, utopian vision is what is needed. To re-engage people with democratic politics, we need to move beyond culture wars and arguments over marginal adjustments to tax rates and budget allocations, necessary as these may be in the short term. Socialists have always seen short-term political struggles as part of a long-term project of transforming society for the better. It is this fact which explains why conservatives have always used the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socialist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a bogeyman. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also why the term has retained its appeal through decades of neoliberal retrenchment. Social democratic and liberal parties, compromised by their acquiescence in, or embrace of, neoliberalism, need to make a decisive break with the recent past. An explicit embrace of socialism would make that break clear.",

                "bodyText":"The Adani Group has promoted a bizarre video advertisement on Facebook, in which the Indian company responds to revelations its Australian coal operations face growing financial risks. The video, targeting people in Melbourne, flashes up text on the screen, backed by fast and upbeat percussive music. It displays \u00e2\u20ac\u0153allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which are labelled as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, followed by attempts to set the record straight. It also misspells \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abott point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, its coal terminal. The video was uploaded along with a long post that contains strange defences of its operation, including the false claim that the entire allegations about the company are based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just one screenshot of random text\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Facebook post had more than 580,000 views on the video statistics at the time of writing. Tim Buckley, a financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, made many of the allegations Adani was attempting to refute. Aired in an episode of ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Four Corners program, the institute claimed Adani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in Australia were unprofitable and required the Carmichael mine to bail them out. Buckley described the video as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153desperate attempt to try and counter some of the facts with loud music and flashing lights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a sign that the campaign against Adani in Australia is having an impact. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In one respect it shows that Adani is taking it seriously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Buckley said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole campaign in Australia is doing enormous damage to the social licence to operate of Adani.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ad has been uncovered by a Guardian Australia and ProPublica collaboration to track political advertising on Facebook. Facebook ads are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sponsored\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posts that an advertiser has paid to push into the news feed of a specifically targeted pool of people. Unless the ad appears in your feed, there is no easy way to determine that a post has been sponsored. This makes it difficult to keep track of political advertising on the social network. Facebook advertising is considered effective because it allows messaging to be fed to a very specific audience based on demographics and interests. In this case, the Adani ad was aimed at targeting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people ages 18 and older who live or were recently near Melbourne, Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The video was posted on 17 October, about two weeks after Four Corners aired a report about the escalating financial risks of Adani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in Australia, including the Abbot Point coal terminal, and the proposed Carmichael coalmine. Much of the Four Corners story was based on a detailed report by the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (Ieefa), which said the push to develop the Carmichael mine appeared to be a desperate attempt by Adani to save its unprofitable and debt-ridden Abbot Point coal terminal. It also revisited the allegations of financial and environmental crimes committed by the Adani Group and its senior executives, including those allegations revealed by the Guardian. Adani says the post was a response to a GetUp video, which itself was a summary of the Ieefa and Four Corners reports. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The entire baseless accusation on Adani is based on just one screenshot of random text with no mention of its origins or reference.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the Ieefa report is publicly available, and contains a long list of references, also available to anyone. The allegations of tax avoidance are based on many documents, including a leaked investigation from the Indian directorate of revenue intelligence, which the Guardian has published. One key part of the Ieefa and Four Corners report was the fact that the existing Abbot Point coal terminal had been operating at only 50% capacity, adding to evidence the port\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s viability was tied to the successful development of the Carmichael coal mine, which will fill the rest of its throughput. The Facebook post says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Abbot Point Coal Terminal has consistently delivered 100% of supply-driven throughout and is not a low utilisation of Asset.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, government data from the North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c collated in the Ieefa report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shows the port has averaged just over 50% utilisation since the beginning of 2015. The advertisement attacks the idea that Abbot Point is unprofitable by making an unusual claim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The capital structure of Abbot point is rated by rating agencies and has investment grade rating from S&amp;P (BBB-),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it says. However, BBB- is the lowest investment grade rating, below which assets become known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153junk bonds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Buckley and one of the authors of the Ieefa report said that particular company (Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd) with the poor rating was the only publicly listed company in the Adani group, and the only one in the group that had a credit rating at all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That listed company is totally removed from the operations in Australia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Buckley said, adding that if any other group company had a credit rating, it would be even lower. At the end of Adani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post, it makes a passing reference to GetUp, suggesting the post was also motivated by one of their videos. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The analysis of the nos. from the balance sheet by Getup is not correct. In fact, the whole video is a bundle of lies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the post says. GetUp posted several videos after the Four Corners story, including one that summarised the findings of the Ieefa report. A spokesman for Adani told the Guardian the video was a response to a GetUp video, which included \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a non-sourced frame of allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest Brexit dashboard, showing the state of the UK economy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a very cheery picture this month: And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A quiet day in the City ended with the FTSE 100 up just 20 points. Mining firms had a good day, led by Antofagasta which gained 2.8%. Whitbread led the fallers, though, after the slowdown at its Costa Coffee chain disappointed analysts. Some were also concerned that the occupancy rate at its Premier Inn hotel chain had slowed. The pound has also lost ground, and is now down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.3128. Bad news 2: World wine production has dropped to a 50 year low, after spring frosts and summer heatwaves ravaged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tender vines. Bad news 1: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountain of consumer debt is reaching dangerous levels, according to credit rating agency S&amp;P. Back to gender equality in the City, or rather the lack of it. My colleague Jill Treanor reports that two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks - Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan- haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet signup to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new charter aimed at addressing the issue.... Newsflash from America: US companies are growing at a faster rate this month. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity at US factories, has jumped to 54.5 in October, from 53.1 last month. The services sector also picked up pace, with its PMI rising to 55.9 from 55.3. That implies that the US economy continues to grow at a healthy rate. Over in Moscow Cyprus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 head of state Nikos Anastasiades is holding talks with president Vladimir Putin on the second day of an official visit aimed at strengthening economic ties between the two countries. Cyprus is without doubt Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friendliest EU member state and this afternoon the Greek Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades went out of his way to make the point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I may say that this visit is in the framework of those fine relations between the Republic of Cyprus and the Russian Federation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anastasiades making his third visit to Moscow since becoming president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to inform the Russian leadership about recent developments in the Cyprus issues, discuss issues related to ties with the European Union and Russia, essential regional issues and the possible role of Cyprus in solving them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek Cypriot leader is expected to sign a number of treaties with Putin raising the total number of bilateral agreements to 67. A joint action plan for the period 2018-2020 will seek to reinforce, political, economic, defence and energy ties between the two with ministers from both countries signing pacts on maritime and road transport, communications and information technology. The Cypriot government is also seeking to raise the number of Russian tourists from 900,000 to one million over the coming year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are constantly striving towards improving air connectivity between our two countries, which in principle is one of the major priorities of my government, and also focusing on enhancing the experience for Russian tourists by offering more and more qualiuty services,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anastasiades said. More than 40,000 Russian citizens live permanently on Cyprus, prompting the community to field a Russian party in presidential elections due early next year. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results have helped to send the US stock market to fresh record highs, once again.... Caterpillar, the machinery and construction giant, has smashed Wall Street forecasts. The firm, famous for its yellow diggers, hiked its profit forecasts and announced that revenues had surged by 25% to $11.4bn in the last quarter. Caterpillar, which is a good barometer for the global economy, reported growing strength in a number of areas, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector and North America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil and gas industry. Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones &amp; Co, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Results were better than expected across the board, with construction, mining, energy all strong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This has sent the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares up by over 6%, to a new all-time high. John Mann MP has now issued a statement, criticising the Bank of England for not appointing more women to top jobs (an issue raised earlier). He argues that the BoE should widen its recruitment pool - perhaps even adding a trades union leader such as Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady to the monetary policy committee.... Mann says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last week, the appointment of Sir Dave Ramsden to the Deputy Governorship at the Bank of England was confirmed. It is shameful that when so many talented women are at the forefront of the private sector, the trade union movement and the academic world, institutions like the Treasury and the Bank of England keep turning to the same group of men to fill their appointments. I hope to see an increasingly diverse range of nominees come before the Treasury Committee as new vacancies arise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, it has appointed several women to the MPC in recent years, such as Kristin Forbes and Minouche Shafik. Both have since left, though, leaving the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top committees looking terribly male (apart from the newly appointed Silvana Tenreyro, of course). Speaking of Greece.... the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout review began in earnest today. And, for once, the visit by international monitors appears to have got off to a good start! Helena Smith reports from Athens. A first round of talks between inspectors representing debt-stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international creditors and finance ministry officials has begun in optimistic mood. A senior finance ministry source said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected primary surplus would well exceed 1.75% of GDP in 2017. That would underline how fiscal indicators have improved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and boosts hopes that the review will be wrapped up without negotiations becoming tortuous or prolonged. Greek government sources have welcomed the European Stability Mechanism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that a decision will finally be made on Thursday as to whether Athens should receive a remaining bailout disbursement of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800m in aid. Release of the funds will ultimately depend on progress the Greek state had made in clearing arrears. Late Monday the normally acerbic Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem echoed the optimism telling an audience in Ireland that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme was back on track and that fellow eurozone members were prepared to do more to manage the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt mountain if called for. Dijsselbloem declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have managed to help the debt burden, a lot has been done there. We stand ready, if they do their part, to do more if necessary. At the end of the programme in the summer next year, we will look again at how sustainable the debt is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has formally stepped down as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister and taken up a new position as president of the Bundestag. And to mark the occasion, hundreds of finance ministry staff assembled themselves into a big fat zero for a photo which was presented to Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble last night. That may sound like a curious move - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a tribute to Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to balance Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and deliver a zero deficit. Countries who suffered badly during the eurozone crisis might feel a different send-off is in order, given Schauble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to Greece getting debt relief. Marcus Walker of the Wall Street Journal reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hidden meaning behind the photo. Sir Jon Cunliffe isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only BoE policymaker sounding wary of raising interest rates next month. Last week, fellow deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden revealed that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the majority of MPC members who felt, in September, that a rate rise was close. The Bank, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raised interest rates for a decade, will remember the experience of the European Central Bank; it hiked, prematurely, in 2011, and was later forced to cut into negative territory to stimulate the economy. But, having insisted several times that a rate hike is coming, can governor Mark Carney really fail to deliver? He already has a reputation as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, having abandoned his earlier forward guidance on when rates would go up. As Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Goodman puts it: Carney also has to worry about credibility. He has previously come under fire for hinting at rate increases that never arrived, with one lawmaker branding him an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2014. That label has stuck with him ever since, and, even though he has stuck resolutely to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd language in recent comments, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under pressure to deliver this time. Sterling has fallen a little this morning, following BoE deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words about interest rates. The pound has lost a quarter of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.317, and a similar amount against the euro to below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. Traders are taking note of Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that he might not vote to raise borrowing costs at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, as UK growth is weak and real wages are falling. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, says Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have put the pound under pressure: Analysts have typically favoured the pound as the likelihood of a rate rise increases, and so any signals to the contrary could weigh on sterling. Incidentally, this chart shows how the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum caused a spike in inflation, and a long-term impact on prices too.... Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia also told the Treasury committee about how sexism used to be rife in the financial sector. She explained that during her time at Royal Bank of Scotland.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a very male culture and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked previously about part of that being the sort of win-lose culture. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Undoubtedly there was a pervading sexism where I remember a very senior woman being very upset one day telling me that she was expected to sleep with her boss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That sort of thing of course means that there are issues for women in progressing through financial services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC has more details. Jayne-Anne Gadhia also suggested there was no excuse for the Bank of England not to have a decent number of women in senior positions. Currently the Financial Policy Committee is entirely male, while Silvana Tenreyro is the only woman on the Monetary Policy Committee. But, Gadhia tells the Treasury Committee, women such as (IMF chief) Christine Lagarde and (Fed chair) Janet Yellen have proved that gender is no barrier. John Mann MP agrees.... Over in parliament, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money, has been discussing how to tackle gender imbalances in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. She told the Treasury committee that Virgin Money have used blind recruitment processes to give all applicants a fair chance, and training to help staff avoid their own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunconscious biases\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She argues that a senior manager, such as the chief executive, needs to be held accountable for helping address gender imbalances, and pay disparities. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her four-part plan: A clear strategy for tackling workplace inequality Make it measurable Make someone responsible for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at 70% of firms it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the CEO Attach someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus to it Gadhia says that she asks for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced recruitment lists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for senior positions, to give a roughly equal number of men and women to choose between. Gadhia adds that the companies who are tackling gender inequality best are those who treat it as a business issue, not simply an HR one - and implement policies such as flexible working. This is an important issue for Gadhia, who was appointed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender diversity Champion last year. She says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pleased that the Bank of England has just signed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Women in Finance Charter. Some major firms still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the list, though, she adds.... Newsflash: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective government debt pile has shrunk, as a percentage of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Eurozone government debt was equal to 89.1% of GDP at the end of June, down from 89.2% in the first quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite a rise in the annual deficit in the second quarter of the year: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers report shows that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is still strong, says economist Rupert Seggins: Jon Ferro of Bloombeg points out that manufacturing is leading the way: But the team at Sigma Squawk are concerned that the service sector slowed this month: Newsflash: Companies across the eurozone are growing at a slower rate than expected this month. The Composite Purchasing Managers Index has dropped to 55.9, down from 56.7 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a weaker reading than expected, but still shows solid expansion (anything over 50 shows growth). Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is having a good month - with the manufacturing PMI accelerating to 58.6, from 58.1. That suggests that activity is rattling along. But the services PMI dropped to 54.9, from 55.8 - a weaker reading than forecast. Markit reports that Germany and France were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth drivers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while peripheral countries lagged behind. Whitbread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Britain is entering a third wave of coffee drinking, and happy to pay more for more complicated brews, might amuse their rivals at McDonalds..... Whitbread shares have fallen by over 4% in early trading, as traders react to the slowdown in sales and falling profits at its Costa Coffee chain. Like-for-like sales at Costa only rose by 0.1% in the three months to 31 August, in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the company reported this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty sharp slowdown -- sales grew by 1.1% in the previous quarter. And it hit the bottom line -- statutory pre-tax profit at Costa fell by almost 10% in the last six months, from \u00c2\u00a365m to \u00c2\u00a359m. This has sent Whitbread sliding the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, despite reporting a 7% rise in underlying profits across its business (which includes Premier Inn hotels). Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Whitbread is suffering from rising cost pressures and a slowing economy: Whitbread will be well aware of the pressures facing the purses of UK consumers. Weaker like-for-like numbers this time round will add to worries that customers are feeling the pinch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love affair with coffee (yum yum!) fading? Not according to Whitbread; they reckon we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthird wave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is... a period in which consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences for coffee become more sophisticated and are willing to spend more per cup for higher quality and innovative drinks.

Sign up here. Sir Jon Cunliffe also warned European cities that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knock London off its perch as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre, despite Brexit. He told the Western Mail that some City banks will move operations over the Channel, or even the Atlantic, once Britain leaves the European Union. That could be bad news for jobs and tax receipts down the line. But this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin can supersede London, Cunlifee argues: We have an expertise in financial services and we have a critical mass of talent and deep knowledge and those sort of big economic agglomerations and economic activity exist because they add value and they reduce costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may be that some activities that are carried out in London have to move to the continent. And maybe some activities carried out in London no longer become efficient, and rather than moving to the continent, they just go back to New York or somewhere else, or maybe they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen at all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see London as a financial centre being replicated on the continent anytime soon as it takes an awful lot of critical mass of expertise and knowledge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top policymakers has cautioned against assuming that UK interest rates will rise next month. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor at the BoE, says that with the UK economy suffering weak growth it is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open question\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whether the Bank will raise borrowing costs in November. Speaking on a trip to Wales, Cunliffe told the Western Mail that UK workers are suffering falling real wages (due to the spike in inflation since the Brexit vote). And while interest rates are certain, in his view, to be higher in three years time - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no guarantee that the first hike in a decade is imminent. Mr Cunliffe told the Western Mail that the UK economy has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly slowed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that any rate rises will be gradual. As he put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our August forecast we forecast that rate of growth [GDP] of about 1.5% a year, and it is going to continue for the next two to three years. And pay is going to gradually pick up from around 2% to around 3.5% by the end [three year forecast period]. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that is going to put some domestic pressure on inflation, as the imported inflation eases off. Now if that forecast comes to pass over the forecast period, interest rates will need to go up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They will not need to go up by as far and as fast as they did before the crisis, but over the forecast period of three years rates will need to rise. The exact timing of when that starts? Well, that for me is a more open question.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting is on November 2nd. Back in the summer, we got several hints that the MPC was close to voting to raise rates from their record low of 0.25%. But, with Brexit uncertainty weighing on companies, and wages only rising by 2.1% per year (compared to inflation at 3%), perhaps the committee is having second thoughts.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get our first insight into how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing this quarter, with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey of purchasing managers at companies across the eurozone. City analysts expect to learn that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and service sector companies are still expanding steadily this month. The headline eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at 56.5 for October, down slightly on September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 56.7, but still showing strong growth. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada explain: The PMIs ended the second quarter higher than they begun it, suggesting some pick-up in momentum toward the quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end and the continued strength of new orders in both the manufacturing and services sectors suggests that should continue into the third quarter. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee is holding an inquiry into women in finance (why there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more of them, and why more don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise to the top). Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money, will give her insight.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed higher - but Spain has bucked the trend as the Catalan crisis escalates further. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is still under negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Far from being a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ceiling of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1bn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would characterize last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amazon September results as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPicasso-like quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, as it shows America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the last quarter came from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rate hike is fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Kohl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad sales. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Corporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s durables release). Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet day... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.15am BST: Peter Praet, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, speaks a a conference on financial market policy in Frankfurt. 1.30pm BST: US GDP report released.",

Sky and BT, which own billions of pounds of rights to sport including Premier League and Champions League football, made the top 10 list of claimants with 14 cases between them. Sky, which paid more than \u00c2\u00a34bn for the rights to air the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of Premier League matches in the UK, has been particularly aggressive in seeking to make an example of pirates to deter others. In two recent cases, Sky won damages against an individual who illegally streamed the Anthony Joshua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hugely popular world title fights against Wladimir Klitschko on Facebook, which attracted 600,000 viewers, and in another case against a Bristol man who illegally streamed Sky Sports on a pirate blog. Andrew Griffith, the group chief operating officer at Sky, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are in the middle of a significant shift in tackling this type of piracy, a fightback that is making it harder and harder for people to stream content illegally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Premier League won an injunction earlier this year that called on internet service providers such as Sky, BT and Virgin Media to block live football streams.

She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a country that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-property\">taxes British residents</a>, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">overheated housing market</a>. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police\">holds UK property in offshore companies</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/egregious-loophole-property-capital-gains-tax-close-foreign-owners-commercial\">This egregious tax loophole costs the UK \u00c2\u00a38bn every year.

These problems are continuing.</li> </ul> <p>Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing<br></p> <ul> <li>The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly.</li> <li>Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment.</li> <li>The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc.</li> <li>We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast.

This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income.</p> <p>Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding).

                "bodyText":"In an uncertain day ahead of a busy week, the Spanish stock market bucked the trend and jumped sharply on hopes that the Catalan independence crisis could be resolved. A positive set of GDP numbers for the country also helped sentiment. Elswhere the FTSE 100 slipped lower, as its overseas earners reacted badly to a stronger pound, which moved higher ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting where the first interest rise in a decade is widely expected. On Wall Street the latest developments in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election saw markets slip back. There was also talk that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long awaited tax reforms may only be gradual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00c2\u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00c2\u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10% of our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including most high value property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmonth/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153head for the exits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial price declines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primary driver of inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally, a chart showing why \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccash for clunkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery weak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit by \u00c2\u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent growth figures this morning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00c2\u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00c2\u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00c2\u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpreadsheet Phil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 and 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u201c08, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchypothecated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given all the current pressures and uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the policy action that these might require \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasingly intense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very tricky hand indeed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. The \u00c2\u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00c2\u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00c2\u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00c2\u00a370 billion) in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c22 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00c2\u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit is on track to still be \u00c2\u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as much as the \u00c2\u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwriggle room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",
