                "bodyText":"Apple is considering moving into the studio famous for films such as Gone With The Wind and The Matrix as it vies to become a major player in TV and film. The tech company plans to invest $1bn on original TV programming over the next year and is reportedly in discussions with the Culver Studios, close to the Culver City offices of Beats, which it acquired from co-founders Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine for $3bn two years ago. The studio, which has been owned by RKO, Howard Hughes and Cecil B DeMille, has more than a dozen soundstages for TV and film work. However, Apple is mainly looking for office space, according to the Financial Times. Moving the management of its original content division to such a status symbol location would mark Apple\u2019s latest signal that it is to ramp up its challenge to streaming giants Netflix and Amazon as well as traditional TV broadcasters. Apple made no comment on the talks and Culver Studios was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. In June, Apple recruited Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony as its new TV chiefs. The pair have been responsible for striking a \u00a3100m co-production deal with Netflix to make The Crown, and have overseen production of hit shows including Breaking Bad and The Black List. Apple has so far only dipped its toe in original programming, striking a deal to spin James Corden\u2019s popular Carpool Karaoke segment from his late night TV show in the US into a 16-episode series featuring stars such as Will Smith. There was also Planet of the Apps \u2013 a sort of Dragon\u2019s Den featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am, Jessica Alba and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk on a panel that sees app developers competing for funding \u2013 which Apple Music made available in June. In development are documentaries about Sean \u201cP Diddy\u201d Combs and Clive Davis, as well as a six-part series on Dr Dre. Given Apple\u2019s huge resources \u2013 it has a stock value of $815bn, almost twice Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon ($474bn), five times Disney ($168bn), and more than 10 times Netflix ($77bn) \u2013 its intent to enter original programming makes it a serious new player in the TV market. Netflix has committed $6.6bn to buying and creating TV programmes and it makes about 1,000 hours of its owns shows annually; HBO, the Game of Thrones and Sopranos maker, spends about $2bn a year. Amazon, which paid up to \u00a3150m to lure former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, is estimated to spend about $4.5bn annually on its Prime Video service. Analysts had speculated that Apple could buy Disney to bolster its content strategy.",

                "body":"<p>Apple\u2019s stock market value is heading towards a new milestone and its latest product launch on 12 September could push the tech giant closer to becoming the first ever $1tn (\u00a3760bn) company.</p> <p>At the end of last week, the company\u2019s market capitalisation hovered around $830bn, continuing a 10-year run that has generally headed upwards since a low of $69bn in January 2009, during the financial crisis. Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations.</p> <p>But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming.</p> <h2><strong>iPhone</strong></h2> <p>The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone&#xa0;8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success.</p> <p>Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently.</p> <p>But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\" data-alt=\"Apple's share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\">Apple's share price</a> </figure>  <p>The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d</p> <p>The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply. Apple needs to avoid that happening again, says Dawson: \u201cIt has to supply the new premium phone in high enough numbers so that if there\u2019s a big demand shift from the standard models to the new one, it doesn\u2019t end up depressing overall sales while there are supply constraints.\u201d</p> <p>Apple seems confident. For the current quarter, it has forecast revenues of $49bn-$52bn, which would represent growth of between 4% and 11% from a year ago, and bring its performance back to 2015 levels. Dawson expects that iPhone sales will grow year-on-year in the October-December and January-March quarters: \u201cMuch of the timing of that growth will depend on the supply constraints.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wearables</strong></h2> <p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/25/apple-watch-spring-launch-wearable-technology\" title=\"\">\u201cwearables\u201d \u2013 the market sector dominated by digital watches and Fitbits \u2013 were seen as the next technology hit</a>. But the first Apple Watch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-review-smartwatch-iphone-taptic-siri\" title=\"\">released in April 2015</a>, underwhelmed many reviewers.</p> <p>None the less, early adopters liked it; the research company IDC reckons 28.8m had sold by the end of July this year. Though Apple doesn\u2019t release unit sales or revenues, it is definitely the world\u2019s most popular smartwatch, while Google\u2019s rival Android Wear business has failed to take off.</p> <p>Now Apple is readying a version that can use 4G phone networks. It means those who have bought an Apple Watch for fitness reasons \u2013 the watch\u2019s biggest customer base \u2013 can stream music or podcasts while they run and work out, as well as making FaceTime video or audio calls, getting map directions, and receiving and replying to messages. According to Bloomberg, the 4G version will be on sale at the four US mobile carriers, and possibly through European networks too.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s wearables strategy doesn\u2019t stop at the Watch: its wireless in-ear AirPods headphones, which have been in short supply since their launch last year, have delighted those who managed to get their hands on them. With supply improving, they could be a Christmas hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81eacf54ed2890cca350c40a37501a80f7c0fd4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81eacf54ed2890cca350c40a37501a80f7c0fd4c/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Apple Watch: liked by its owners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apple Watch: liked by its owners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Home</strong></h2> <p>With the smartphone market now well established, the home is the new battlefield for the big tech companies. A few years ago most people expected that Microsoft would be a serious contender because its Xbox console was installed in millions of living rooms.</p> <p>But instead Amazon has taken a lead, having sold an estimated 15 million of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/amazon-echo-review-the-best-combined-speaker-and-voice-assistant-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">voice-controlled Echo and Dot devices</a>, which can provide weather, news and traffic reports and play music, as well as controlling digitally connected lights and similar devices around the home. Google joined in last year with its Google Home device. Now Apple is pitching in with HomePod, a high-quality music speaker controlled by its Siri voice assistant. As you might guess, it\u2019s pricey, with a reported cost of around \u00a3349 in the UK.</p> <p>Also expected is an update to Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box, to allow it to stream higher definition pictures. On its own, that might not sound much. But the company has big ambitions in the US market, where millions of homes are abandoning expensive monthly cable-TV contracts and opting for cheaper services such as Netflix. Apple always wants to get ahead of those broader digital trends. Now it aims to become an alternative TV service, offering a la carte programming if you buy its hardware.</p> <p>However, TV networks won\u2019t license their programmes cheaply because they want to retain the viewers who in turn watch the adverts that provide their revenues. So Apple is having to make its own. Eddy Cue, the executive behind this drive, is well-armed for the fight. As well as hiring TV and film executives, he has bought the rights to James Corden\u2019s <em>Carpool Karaoke</em> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/apple-said-to-plan-1-billion-investment-in-tv-shows-and-films\" title=\"\">has a $1bn warchest</a> for producing original content. Although that\u2019s a long way from Netflix\u2019s $6bn annual spending, or Amazon\u2019s estimated $4.5bn, Apple is ambitious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a1a7243f12bd9af1210b3497e60745fc43bc972\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a1a7243f12bd9af1210b3497e60745fc43bc972/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook: leading Apple into film and TV production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Software</strong></h2> <p>A new iPhone means a new version of Apple\u2019s iOS software, which will update about 500m existing devices as well as running on the new products. With iOS 11, iPhone and iPads will be able to run \u201caugmented reality\u201d (AR) apps, which can overlay <em>Star Wars</em> spaceships, or map directions, or geolocated information, on to a live camera view on the screen. AR apps are forecast to spark a new app boom; some of them will struggle, but it only takes one success to validate the entire field. And Apple will have an advantage over Android, where AR will only work on a few million devices by the end of the year.</p> <h2><strong>Services</strong></h2> <p>For the past seven quarters, and 12 of the past 19, the fastest-growing part of Apple has been its \u201cservices\u201d. Most recently generating $7.2bn \u2013 more than either iPad or Mac sales \u2013 it includes Apple Music fees, the 30% cut of payments and subscriptions on millions of apps in the App Store, and payment for iCloud storage (where only the first 5GB is free).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/09/apple-dash-content-from-handsets-to-hollywood\">From handsets to Hollywood: Apple joins the dash for content</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly pointed out to analysts that, on its own, the services segment generates enough revenue to enter the Fortune 100 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. As the iPhone user base grows, and people buy more apps, the services segment keeps growing. And if the Apple TV ploy succeeds, it could really take off. What Wall Street really likes about services, though, is its promise of recurring revenue, separate from hardware sales. If Apple grows its user base, the Services segment grows too; thus it also provides an indicator of the overall health of the company\u2019s ecosystem of hardware, software, users and developers. Suddenly, a $1tn valuation looks attainable \u2013 and sustainable.</p> <h2>Surprises</h2> <p>What else is Apple working on? The company\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cProject Titan\u201d, appears to have been scaled down and the firm will no longer build self-driving vehicles: according to reports, it will concentrate on the software behind autonomous cars instead. More likely to arrive sooner are \u201cAR glasses\u201d for putting augmented reality right in front of you. In March the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac83150-10db-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d\" title=\"\">reported that Apple is working on such glasses</a>; what\u2019s unclear, as ever, is the timescale. Months? Years? We can\u2019t be sure until Tim Cook shows it off on stage.</p>",

Software A new iPhone means a new version of Apple\u2019s iOS software, which will update about 500m existing devices as well as running on the new products. With iOS 11, iPhone and iPads will be able to run \u201caugmented reality\u201d (AR) apps, which can overlay Star Wars spaceships, or map directions, or geolocated information, on to a live camera view on the screen. AR apps are forecast to spark a new app boom; some of them will struggle, but it only takes one success to validate the entire field. And Apple will have an advantage over Android, where AR will only work on a few million devices by the end of the year. Services For the past seven quarters, and 12 of the past 19, the fastest-growing part of Apple has been its \u201cservices\u201d. Most recently generating $7.2bn \u2013 more than either iPad or Mac sales \u2013 it includes Apple Music fees, the 30% cut of payments and subscriptions on millions of apps in the App Store, and payment for iCloud storage (where only the first 5GB is free). Chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly pointed out to analysts that, on its own, the services segment generates enough revenue to enter the Fortune 100 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. As the iPhone user base grows, and people buy more apps, the services segment keeps growing. And if the Apple TV ploy succeeds, it could really take off. What Wall Street really likes about services, though, is its promise of recurring revenue, separate from hardware sales. If Apple grows its user base, the Services segment grows too; thus it also provides an indicator of the overall health of the company\u2019s ecosystem of hardware, software, users and developers. Suddenly, a $1tn valuation looks attainable \u2013 and sustainable. Surprises What else is Apple working on? The company\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cProject Titan\u201d, appears to have been scaled down and the firm will no longer build self-driving vehicles: according to reports, it will concentrate on the software behind autonomous cars instead. More likely to arrive sooner are \u201cAR glasses\u201d for putting augmented reality right in front of you. In March the Financial Times reported that Apple is working on such glasses; what\u2019s unclear, as ever, is the timescale. Months? Years? We can\u2019t be sure until Tim Cook shows it off on stage.",
