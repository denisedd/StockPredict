                "bodyText":"Production at US factories in August grew at the weakest rate since June 2016 according to the latest manufacturing PMI report from IHS Markit. The headline index slipped to 52.8 in August, from 53.3 in July (where anything above 50 signals growth). Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: Although still above the 50 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno change\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level, the decline in the PMI shows signs of a renewed stuttering of the manufacturing economy during August. The latest reading indicates one of the weakest improvements in the overall health of the sector seen over the past year, and translates into disappointing signals for comparable official data. The survey brings more encouraging signs of improved domestic demand, however, with orders for both consumer goods and investment goods such as plant and machinery on the rise, boding well for the wider economy to continue to expand as we move through the second half of 2017. And on that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM The opening bell has been rung on Wall Street and here is how it looks: Dow Jones: +0.2% at 21,984 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,476 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 6,444 European markets have also stayed in positive territory, although the FTSE 100 is now up just 7 points or 0.1% at 7,437. The dollar has broadly recovered after a sharp fall immediately after the weak non-farm payrolls report was published. The dollar index is down just 0.1% now, but the pound has held on to its gains against the US currency at $1.2987. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital: The US dollar was driven down and then snapped back to trade almost flat after a weaker-than-expected jobs report left traders searching for direction. Although a miss it looks like this print isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing anything to alter projections for what the Federal Reserve will do later this month or for the rest of the year. The labour market remains in fine health, wage growth is AWOL and inflation lacklustre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing has changed today. One swallow doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a summer and one August jobs miss doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make for a weakening labour market. Markets have already decided the Fed probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike again this year. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, takes the view that the weak jobs report will make the Fed more reluctant to raise interest rates again before the end of the year. If Federal Reserve policy makers were already starting to question the need for another rate hike this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the pace thereafter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have made them feel any more comfortable. Anyone hoping for a signal this month that the Fed is on track for another rate hike this year may well be disappointed. The downward revision to July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls number was the icing on the cake. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that while the numbers are disappointing, the labor market is still performing very well, but when inflation data is lacking, the Fed is relying on the employment data to justify more rate hikes. The jobs report will be seen as a blow to Fed chances of another rate hike this year, as well as to Donald Trump who I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure would have loved nothing more than a reason to post something positive on Twitter. I feel this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report may not make the Twitter cut. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says that while the non-farm payrolls report was gloomy, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad enough to have an impact on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decisions. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report was disappointing across the board but, given the potential seasonal problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with weak initial readings in August subsequently revised higher in previous years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to have any meaningful impact on the Fed. With the survey evidence still strong and third-quarter economic growth on course for another decent gain after the second, there is no reason to believe that the modest drop-off in employment growth is the start of a more serious downturn. Nevertheless, since the September figures could be affected by Hurricane Harvey, the Fed might be waiting until the October data are released in early November before confirming that the labour market remains in good health. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.5% following the weak payrolls report from the Labor Department. The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss is the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gain, with sterling now up 0.4% at $1.2986. The detail of the non-farm payrolls report showed a surprise uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in August, from 4.3% in July. Earnings growth was unchanged at 2.5%, disappointing expectations of a pick-up to 2.6%. Breaking: US non-farm payrolls have come in well below expectations, with 156,000 jobs added in August. The consensus among economists was 180,000 jobs. The number for July was also revised down to 189,000 from 209,000 previously. More soon... Over in Greece, the government said the economy is finally moving on from the crisis, after a second consecutive quarter of growth between April and June. A statement released by the office of prime minister Alexis Tsipras said: Without any doubt the Greek economy has turned a page. We are continuing our efforts for just growth, one in which workers ate protected, and building a new productive model. The leftist-led coalition added that even at the height of tortuous negotiations to unlock emergency funding from creditors and keep debt-stricken Greece afloat, the economy exhibited signs of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dynamic recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Opposition parties contend that because of bungled negotiations under former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, the punishing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout package Athens was forced to sign up to - in the form of a third rescue - was much harsher than necessary. Time for a look again at European markets, which have extended gains this afternoon ahead of the US non-farm payrolls at 13.30. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,456 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.9% at 12,165 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +1% at 5,134 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 21,841 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,356 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 376 Some positive news on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, which grew for a second successive quarter between April and June. GDP grew by 0.5% in the second quarter, maintaining the pace of first-quarter growth. Annual growth picked up to 0.8% from 0.4%. The main driver of growth in the second quarter was exports, which increased by 3.8%. The pound is roughly stable today against both the dollar and the euro, at $1.2926 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0847 respectively. But Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says the pound is in for a tough time as uncertainty grows: Sterling has had a rough month, particularly against the euro. A big part of that has been driven by euro strength ... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the fact that recent data suggests the Brexit chickens may finally be coming home to roost for the economy, with lukewarm consumer spending and flat business investment. It all adds up to a lot of uncertainty, which of course translates to rich pickings for sterling bears. Politics and growth remain the two key considerations for the rest of the year. How quickly Brexit negotiations move from divorce terms to the future relationship between the EU and UK stands out as a key issue, as delays risk further dents to business investment. High frequency data, especially retail sales, will also be worth picking apart with a fine-tooth comb as the last couple of months have shown some recovery, but real wages remain in contraction and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear how consumers will respond. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, says the US non-farm payrolls number would have to come in a lot higher than expected to give the dollar a major boost. (Economists are forecasting a headline figure of 180,000 jobs.) It will require a big beat on the headline jobs number today for the dollar to get another leg up from these levels. With EURUSD holding below 1.19 and USJPY above 110 there does not much scope to the upside unless the non-farm payrolls (NFP) over deliver in a big way. The dollar was looking a touch oversold but has found its feet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just needs some more direction but the NFP will only provide that if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly stronger than expected or undershoots. On hopes for the NFP, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about whether this print is strong enough to get the market talking up another hike this year, which is currently a 1-in-3 chance right now. Shares in drugs group Indivior are down almost 40% after it lost a US patent ruling that could pave the way for the launch of rivals to its Suboxone Film heroin substitute. The shares plunge made it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 and wiped more than \u00c2\u00a31bn off the value of the company. Read our full story here: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, the national statistics bureau ISTAT confirmed. It matched first-quarter growth and left the annual growth rate for Q2 unchanged at 1.5%. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing trade body, EEF, says that the UK PMI suggests the sector is in store for a better second half of the year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data confirm that UK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home. The raft of decent survey data from the sector suggest manufacturing output growth should look better in the second half of this year than it did in the first, but longer term the continued robustness of demand in the rest of the world and the right investment decisions at home to capitalise on it will be key to sustaining this picture. The UK manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high in August. Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says that while the survey signals strong growth, manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook. The pickup in the PMI brings tentative hope that the recent decline in the official manufacturing output data will be reversed swiftly. The manufacturing sector, however, should be doing even better, given sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge depreciation and the emergence of a strong recovery in the eurozone. Indeed, the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI remained below the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the fourth consecutive month. In addition, manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 optimism regarding future production growth only edged up in August to its five-year average, suggesting that they will invest only cautiously in extra capacity. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories were going full steam ahead in August according to the IHS Markit UK manufacturing PMI. The headline index combining factory output, orders and employment, rose to a four-month high of 56.9, from 55.3 in July. It comfortably beat economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of 55. Demand was chiefly driven by domestic customers, but customers also reported new export orders from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector was performing well despite Brexit uncertainty: The key question is whether this positive start to the second half of the year can be sustained. This is looking increasingly likely during the near-term, given the breadth of the expansion. At the moment, the survey data suggest that the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support on-going growth in the economy in the third quarter, which will add fuel to hawkish policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 calls for higher interest rates. Eurozone factories enjoyed strong demand in August, with output growing at a faster pace than in July. The headline index on the IHS Markit manufacturing PMI rose to 57.4, from 56.6 in July (any number above 50 indicates growth). Domestic and export orders were both strong, and expansion was led by Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. Here is how individual countries performed: Austria: 61.1 (78-month high) Netherlands: 59.7 (78-month high) Germany: 59.3 (2-month high) Italy: 56.3 (78-month high) Ireland: 56.1 (25-month high) France: 55.8 (76-month high) Spain: 52.4 (11-month low) Greece: 52.2 (108-month high) Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the August survey suggested a positive start to the third quarter for the eurozone economy. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive manufacturing upturn regained momentum in August, with a summer surge in factory activity suggesting rising goods production will support another strong GDP reading in the third quarter. The survey indicates that euro area manufacturing output is growing at an annual rate of approximately 4%. Producers across the region are benefitting from rising domestic demand as economic recoveries gain momentum, as well as surging export sales. The FTSE 100 is up 15 points this morning, as major markets across Europe rise for a third day. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,446 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.3% at 12,090 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.6% at 5,118 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 21,750 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,336 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 375 China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s August Caixin manufacturing PMI has come in ahead of expectations, picking up to 51.6 from 51.1 in July (where anything above 50 signals growth). It supports the official PMI survey published on Thursday, which also signalled stronger-than-expected growth in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. However Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy: Stronger manufacturing PMI readings for August suggest that industrial output remains resilient. However, momentum elsewhere in the economy has weakened. We suspect that it is speculation over future capacity cuts that has pushed up metal prices and industrial production, rather than stronger underlying demand. Indeed, investment growth has cooled recently and we anticipate a further slowdown as the impact of tighter monetary conditions continue to feed through. If we are right, then the current strength of industrial activity can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sustained for long. Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC, says that it would be wrong to place too much emphasis on the strong ADP jobs report from earlier in the week. US August payrolls dominate the day ahead. Expectations are probably for a firmer reading than the published consensus of a 180K increase after the ADP survey, though we would note that the ADP survey has a very patchy track record and does not consistently improve the accuracy of consensus forecasts. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that time again: non-farm payrolls day. At 13.30 BST we will get the August report on employment and wages, giving the latest snapshot of how well the US jobs market and wider economy are doing. The official consensus among economists is for a 180,000 increase in jobs, following a 209,000 rise in July. Wage growth is expected to edge up to 2.6% from 2.5% previously. However, a stronger-than-expected ADP jobs report earlier in the week is raising speculation the payrolls report could surprise on the upside. If that was the case, investors would be more willing to bet that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson: A decent payrolls number today would be the icing on the cake in a week that has seen some positive signs that the US economy may be in better shape that was previously thought prior to Jackson Hole. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US employment report is expected to see 180k jobs added in August, down from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 209k, however this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper ADP report has seen some estimates for today revised higher. Of more importance will be how strong the wages numbers come in, given an unemployment rate of 4.3%. Annual hourly wage growth is currently 2.5%, a little on the weak side for an economy supposedly at full employment so a strong number here could increase the odds of another rate rise this year, most likely in December. Of course a stronger report is not a foregone conclusion: The other major focus of the day will be manufacturing PMIs from the eurozone and UK, providing the latest clues on the health of those economies: 09.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing PMI (August) 09.00 BST Italian GDP, final estimate (Q2) 09.30 BST UK manufacturing PMI (August)",

                "bodyText":"With the US closed for Labor Day, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a recap. World stock markets have begun the week on the back foot after North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear test on Sunday. European equities are all in the red this afternoon, with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 currently down 26 points or 0.35% at 7411. Asia also suffered, with South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kopsi closing down 1.2% and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei losing almost 1%. Gold continues to benefit from the nervousness, trading at their highest levels since autumn 2016. Investors haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken much comfort from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments, including China criticising US president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to break of trade links with countries who deal with North Korea. Although the City hopes that the crisis can be defused, there is concern that tensions could continue to rise - with South Korea carrying out a simulated attack on North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear test site. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says: Another week, another provocation, as North Korea re-emerges as the key driver of market sentiment this morning. Weakness for Asian markets were provided a predictable precursor to a negative session in Europe, with the FTSE losing ground once more. Unfortunately there is unlikely to be any end in sight for this current standoff with North Korea, with few options seemingly on the table to demilitarise the regime. One thing is for sure, with North Korea testing increasingly threatening weapons, the growing threat of a nuclear war is going to continue bolstering gold prices, which today hit an almost one-year high. Meanwhile in the UK, we have seen more signs that Brexit has hit investment in the building sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, showing growth at a one-month low, suggests that growth prospects have weakened -- with commercial construction showing a sharp decline in August. Tomorrow, we get a flurry of service sector surveys from across the globe, which will show whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services firms also had a tough August. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The boss of one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket chains has warned that food could be left to rot at the UK border after Brexit. Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, told the Press Association that it was important that supply chains kept running smoothly once Britain has left the European Union. Otherwise, new custom checks could cause delays which drive costs up -- and make it harder to get products onto the shelves. Coupe said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you take our fresh produce supply chains, for example, we put things on a lorry in Spain and it will arrive in a distribution centre somewhere in England, and it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have gone through any border checks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything that encumbers that has two effects: it adds cost, and it also has a detrimental effect on freshness - if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re shipping fresh produce from a long distance, even a few hours of delay can make a material impact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Staff from the McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast food chain have held a rally outside parliament today, to mark the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first ever UK strike. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo from the scene.... ...and one from the McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s store in Crayford, in London, where staff walked out this morning (alongside staff from Cambridge). The strikers are demanding that McDonalds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stops using zero-hours contracts by the end of the year, and raises its minimum wage to \u00c2\u00a310 per hour. The company insists that it already pays more than the national living wage (\u00c2\u00a37.50 per hour for those over 25), and will offer all staff the option of a permanent contract by teh end of 2017. But although the strike only affects two stores, it could be a sign that discontent among McDonalds is bubbling up. Dr Jonathan Lord, Lecturer in employment law at the University of Salford Business School, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is no coincidence that the 4th September is Labor day in the US and that for the first time McDonalds employees in the UK will take industrial action in a dispute over pay and contracted hours. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strike has been coordinated on Labor Day in solidarity with other workers who are in dispute against fast food giants around the world. The publicity garnered from the strike, on an important date in the US companies calendar, will signify that McDonalds can no longer guarantee peaceful industrial relations with their workers who are determined to improve conditions not only in the two stores on strike but for the rest of their allies in the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153McDonalds themselves do not seem to be concerned about the industrial action, highlighting that only a small number of their employees who represent less than 0.01% of the workforce are intending to strike in two of their 1,270 UK restaurants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is dangerous rhetoric though, as we have seen from previous industrial disputes in sectors where they would not normally occur as they can manifest into potential problems for organisations if they are not addressed swiftly and satisfactorily. Industrial action has severely declined over the last 100 years with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlighting that only 322,000 working days were lost to strikes in 2016 compared to 29 million in 1979. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report shows that the UK building sector risks sliding into recession, warns Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics. More here, by my colleague Richard Partington.

Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barometer of investor morale beat forecasts by rising to 28.2 for September, suggesting that Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing much angst across the Channel. Robert Grigg, managing director of Property Finance at Hampshire Trust Bank, blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ongoing economic and political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Grigg adds: Though today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows residential housebuilding has bucked the trend, we still need to ensure SME housebuilders are given both government and financial support in order to build their businesses and increase the number of homes in the UK - which is essential to solving the ongoing housing crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector may be a warning signal for the wider economy, says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In stark contrast to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sentiment numbers, the construction industry is looking very down in the mouth as a result of slowing government spending, uncertainty over Brexit and risks to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic landscape. While imprecise, this could be used as a microcosm of the UK investment picture in a post-EU referendum atmosphere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [Reminder: the UK factory PMI rose strongly in August, according to data released on Friday] Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector is now feeling the impact of drop in orders last year, says Noble Francis of the Construction Products Association. Simon French of City firm Panmure Gordon also points out that new construction orders have been sliding for many months. Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, believes Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK construction sector. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sector hit a roadblock this month as purchasing activity slowed for the third month and new business wins were hard to come by. Reduced Government spending, economic uncertainty and Brexit-delayed decision-making among clients were largely to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The struggling commercial sector drove this disappointment, languishing under the pressure with the fastest drop in activity in over a year. Job creation was nothing to shout about and showed signs of a slowdown, as companies reined back additional spending. However, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by housebuilders has helped avoid a sharper slowdown. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial building sector is shrinking at its fastest pace since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying sign, suggesting that companies are cutting back on spending. Breaking! Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sector has fallen to its lowest level in a year. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, just released, has dropped to 51.1 in August - down from 51.9 in July. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worryingly close to the 50 point mark that shows stagnation, and the weakest reading since August 2016. Commercial construction had a particularly bad month, while residential house building was stronger. Markit says that worries over the strength of the UK economy are hurting the sector. Civil engineering activity was close to stagnation and commercial work dropped at the fastest pace since July 2016. Reports from survey respondents widely suggested that concerns about the UK economic outlook had weighed on the commercial development sector, with clients opting to delay spending decisions and, in some cases, scale back planned projects. More to follow.... Although equities are down around the globe, and gold is up, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking at a major rout in the markets (yet, anyway). Investors may be calculating that diplomacy might yet carry the day and military conflict can be avoided. Also, nuclear war is such a terrible outcome to consider \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpricing in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so traders will obviously hope it can be avoided. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, suspects that the markets may rebound soon, even though Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear test is the biggest one yet recorded by North Korea. Sayed says: The markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction seems similar to when missile launches have taken place in the past; investors sell stock, rush to safe havens, assess the situation, and then buy the dips as tension eases. While stocks fell in Asia, the selloff was not massive, mainly because the nuclear test occurred over the weekend and there was enough time to digest the news. An H-bomb is undeniably different from the previous missile launches or nuclear tests; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a game changer for North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deterrent strategy. However, the biggest question to investors remains - what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? Will the tensions lead to negotiations, or war? Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are defying the selloff. Both companies are up 2% this morning in London, following the jump in the gold price to a 10-month high. European stock markets have all fallen at the start of trading, as traders worry about North Korea. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is leading the selloff, down 0.66%. Although there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of immediate military action, the rising tensions are creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood in the markets this morning. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: North Korea has further escalated the geopolitical tensions over the weekend and the US has called for an emergency meeting of the U.N council. For investors, this does not present a stable environment for investing. North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest missile test is overshadowing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest gathering of leading emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia and India. That will surely irritate China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Xi Jinping, as the Brics summit is a key platform for Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international ambitions. Yesterday, Xi warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incessant conflicts in some parts of the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were threatening global piece. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the timing underlines Kim Jong Un\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 defiance, and could provoke a response from China. Whilst he knows the US will no doubt implement further economic sanctions, this time he risks the wrath of China, the only county that could potentially strangle North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. North Korea carried out the nuclear test on Sunday with full knowledge that it would enrage Beijing, with the timing threatening to overshadow the BRIC summit hosted by Chinese President Xi. Yet the rogue state paid little regard to this, which is concerning as it means there appears to be little preventing Kim Jong escalating the tension further. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details on the Brics summit: My colleagues around the world are live-blogging the latest developments in North Korea here. The gold price has hit its highest level in almost a year, as North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest weapons test drives investors into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assets. Bullion is changing hands at $1,337 per ounce, its highest level since last November - when Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock election win rattled the markets. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says gold is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major beneficiary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from rising tensions in the Korean peninsula. Expect North Korean rhetoric to heavily influence the safe haven asset throughout the day as global leaders react to the latest provocations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to school in the UK after the summer break. But City workers are back to fretting about North Korea after it tested what it claimed was a powerful nuclear bomb on Sunday. Pyongyang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest provocation comes just a few days after it fired a missile over Japan. So with the US threatening a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmassive military response\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and South Korea simulating its own reaction, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to worry investors this morning. As Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, puts it: Financial markets are back in risk aversion mode on Monday after the latest nuclear test from North Korea on Sunday triggered the usual safe haven rush. Asian markets have already been hit; Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei dropped by almost 1% as nervous traders drove up the value of the yen. European stock markets are also expected to follow suit too, with falls of around 0.5% expected. Rob Carnell, ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of Asian research, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like a bad horror movie, the North Korea saga intersperses moments of calm, with occasional action to jolt you out of your chair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Carnell reckons it could be a good buying opportunity for investors - unless the situation really does deteriorate (via Reuters). US traders won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to react today, though, as New York is closed for the Labor Day holidays. Investors are also awaiting a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI is expected to remain close to July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11-month low of 51.9 in August. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching McDonalds, where workers at two stores are protesting about the fast food chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low pay and zero-hours contracts.

                "bodyText":"And finally... US factories have posted their biggest drop in orders in three years - giving traders another excuse to kick the dollar. Reuters has the details: New orders for U.S.-made goods recorded their biggest drop in nearly three years in July,but orders for capital goods were stronger than previously reported, pointing to robust business spending at the start of the third quarter. Factory goods orders tumbled 3.3 percent amid a slump in demand for transportation equipment, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That was the biggest drop since August 2014. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data was revised to show orders rising 3.2 percent instead of the previously reported 3.0 percent surge. The dollar has now dropped to a new one-week low against the yen, below \u00c2\u00a5109. And the pound has now risen above $1.30 for the first time since mid-August. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that time of year when Greece returns to the headlines with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister discussing bailout progress with the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici this afternoon. Helena Smith reports from Athens The meeting at 4:30pm Brussels time effectively kicks off yet another bailout review between Greece and the international lenders keeping the debt-stricken nation afloat. One week before technical teams return to Athens, Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister and his deputy Giorgos Houliarakis, will attempt to gauge the mood of creditors with Moscovici. The negotiations, which begin in earnest next month, will focus on around 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or reforms, Athens will have to implement if it is to exit its third, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout by August next year. The leftist-led government is hoping the review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the third since the last financial rescue program was agreed in August 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be completed by December enabling it to return to international markets to finance its debt in 2018. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting comes against the background of controversy caused by Moscovici\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial rescue was far from democratic. Speaking to Corriere della Sera, the EU commissioner said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a scandal in terms of democratic processes, not because the decisions were scandalous, but because the fate of a nation was decided in this way, with the imposition of detailed decisions on pensions and the labour market ... I am talking about the basic details of the life of a country that were decided by a body, behind closed doors, whose work is prepared by technocrats ... without the minimum control of a parliament, without the media really knowing what is being said.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Film fans will remember that concentrated orange juice futures play a key role in classic movie Trading Places. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also in the news today for more serious reasons - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re surging as America prepares for its next hurricane to arrive. Hurricane Irma is strengthening, and heading towards Florida and Puerto Rico. So while local authorities prepare for major disruption, traders are anticipating that Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fruit-producing economy will take a hit. The price of frozen orange juice futures has already jumped by 6% in heavy trading: Over in New York, the US stock market has opened in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 0.3%, or 71 points, in early trading to 21,916 points. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also lost ground, as traders got back to work after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labor Day break, and a weekend dominated by North Korea. Dollar drops as Brainard gives dovish speech Over in America, a key central bank policymaker has argued that US interest rates could rise more slowly than expected. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard says that her colleagues should be cautious before voting to increase borrowing costs again, as underlying inflation pressures are low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that Brainard may not be keen to raise borrowing costs at the next Fed meeting, later this month. She told the Economic Club of New York that strong unemployment figures don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell the full story... There is a notable disconnect between signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment and a string of lower-than-projected inflation readings, especially since inflation has come in stubbornly below target for five years\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Brainard also hints that raising borrowing costs too fast can be dangerous; if it slows growth too much, then the Fed might be forced to cut rates again. Sustainably achieving our inflation objective is especially important, given the apparent persistently low level of the neutral rate and the resulting limited room for maneuver above the effective lower bound. Brainard is known as one of the more dovish Fed members anyway, but these comments have still knocked the dollar to a one-week low against the yen. Drama has been in short supply across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets so far today. The French and German indices are up a bit, while London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped slightly into the red. The pound has recovered a little ground against the US dollar to $1.295, from $1.293, despite the slowdown in the service sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Surprisingly sterling wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bothered about the dip, instead rising 0.2% against both the dollar, weakened by the North Korea issue, and the euro, which is facing the uncertainty of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting. This meant the FTSE lost whatever meagre momentum it had after the bell, the index slipping 0.1% to loiter just above 7400. But....what happened to those worries over North Korea that everyone was talking about yesterday? Well, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been nothing (yet) today to raise the risk of nuclear destruction, so traders have taken their minds off it. David Madden of CMC Markets cautions that this situation may not last long... We have seen this scenario before where tensions rise and stocks fall, followed by no new developments, and then equities bounce back. The situation is still ongoing, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive move could be down to short covering and a bit of bargain hunting. In tense times while these, not many investors would buy into the market for the long haul. Obviously it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news that British service sector companies took on more staff in August (as mentioned earlier). But, it also highlights a wider problem. Unless this hiring creates extra growth, then the UK economy will simply become more unproductive (as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more people cranking out the same amount of output). Economist Rupert Seggins predicts that productivity will actually fall this quarter: So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? The suspicion is that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector is relying on low-paid, insecure workers for growth, rather than splashing on expensive new equipment. This map shows how little capital is invested per worker in the UK, compared to say Germany: City economists are in agreement - the slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector last month is a worry. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unlike the manufacturing PMI which beat expectations, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI dropped to an 11-month low, with respondents noting the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook weighing on growth. The numbers are consistent with the economy continuing to make modest progress in the current quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The most interesting aspect of the report was the reference to cost pressure and the outlook for hiring which accelerated for the third consecutive month. As unemployment is already low, this adds to the concerns that labour shortages could start to push wages higher in the months ahead. With this in mind, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures could make the Monetary Policy Committee sit up and take note. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Together with manufacturing and construction PMIs, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services number indicates a quarterly UK GDP rate of 0.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and slowing all the time. Brexit uncertainty, higher costs and lower investment are slowing UK output to a chronic crawl. The summer months may have been warm but the recessional risks for the UK economy are only increasing as we move into Autumn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector continues to expand, August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading suggests it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing so at a worryingly slow pace. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen such sluggish growth since last September and, although the services sector may not have the potential to dampen GDP as much as manufacturing could, Q3 looks in trouble of coming in below expectations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business conditions remain fragile and unpredictable. As inflationary pressures and slow wage growth intensify, consumer-facing businesses are likely to have felt a drastic slide in trade over the last few months and that spells tougher times ahead for the UK. Andy Bruce of Reuters has tweeted a nice chart, showing how the UK services PMI is too low to justify an interest rate hike. The yellow line shows the services PMI, while the green spikes are interest rate hikes or cuts. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2920, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector PMI. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders are dialling back their expectations for future interest rate rises. The services PMI data has shown that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is losing its steam and this means that the Bank of England would have to continue its support. The services PMI data fell short of forecast and traders have pushed the sell button on the back of this.... The Brexit negotiations are going nowhere and this is weighing on the economy and momentum is gradually losing its strength. The UK urgently needs a credible \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransition plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for life after Brexit to restore confidence among companies, tweets Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, warns that some UK services companies were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paralysed by economic hesitancy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in August. Others, though, shrugged off the uncertainty and pressed on with new product launches. Brock saus August was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A slowdown month as the services sector comes off the boil, challenged by a general unwillingness to spend and invest, alongside fragility in confidence amongst consumers as a result of Brexit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad news, though. UK service sector companies created more jobs for the third month running in August, at the fastest rate since the start of 2016. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector report, combined with earlier (strong) manufacturing and (weak) construction data for August, suggests that the UK economy will only grow by 0.3% this quarter. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A summer slowdown was evident in the economy as the August PMI surveys showed slower rates of expansion in services and construction offsetting an improved performance in the manufacturing sector. The resulting overall expansion was the weakest for six months. Although the latest two months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data put the economy on course for another 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, momentum is being gradually lost. Williamson also warns that uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting confidence: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust manufacturing growth means the economy may be rebalancing towards goods production, aided by the weaker pound, but the slowdowns in services and construction send warning signals about the health of the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The overall level of optimism also remained subdued, mainly linked to Brexit uncertainty, close to levels that have previously been indicative of the economy stalling or even contracting. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI suggested that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are close to recession, but Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI hit a seven-month high. Customer-facing companies such as hotels, restaurants, cinemas, hairdressers and gyms suffered the weakest growth last month, Markit says. Breaking! In another blow to the UK economy, growth in its dominant services sector has fallen to its lowest rate in almost a year. Data firm Markit reports that business activity in August rose at the weakest rate since last September. Firms blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued client demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and rising uncertainty about the UK economic outlook after seeing growth slow this year. New order growth also slowed, with nervous clients holding back on spending decisions. This pulled the UK services PMI down to 53.2, from 53.8 in July. Any reading over 50 shows growth. More to follow.... Chris Bosworth, director of strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says the drop in UK car sales in August isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big surprise. August is a notoriously testing month for new car registrations as consumers divert their spending toward family activities and holidays, so these figures shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come as a complete shock to the industry. However, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is also casting a shadow over the sector, Bosworth adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Brexit negotiations well underway and the government announcing radical changes to the sale of fossil fuelled cars, the motor industry is entering a wave of prolonged uncertainty. This will likely have an impact on consumer spending habits. The Bank of England has already announced that car finance deals have eased as a result. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, 5.5 million British motorists say Brexit has already had a direct impact on their car purchasing plans and has made them more likely to purchase a used car or to hold off their purchase altogether \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of which can have a knock-on effect on the industry and the wider economy. That said, now that the new car registration plates have been released, we expect consumers will splash out on new cars over the next month, keeping in line with the annual trend.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Diesel bore the brunt of the sales decline in August, the SMMT says: Demand for petrol hybrid and pure electric battery powered cars increased substantially, up 74.9% and 62.5%, while plug-in hybrid registrations rose 38.5%. Conventional petrols grew 3.8% and diesels fell -21.3%. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered its fifth monthly fall in sales. New car registrations shrank by 6.4% in August, extending a sales decline that began in April and has fuelled worries over the UK economy. It means that sales in 2017 are 2.4% lower than a year ago, with 1,640,241 new cars joining British roads since January. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which compiled the report, reckons drivers are waiting for the latest number plates to arrive this month. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, August is typically a quiet month for the new car market as consumers and businesses delay purchases until the arrival of the new number plate in September. With the new 67-plate now available and a range of new models in showrooms, we anticipate the continuation of what are historically high levels of demand. Just in: Growth across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has hit a seven-month low, but remains robust. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro-area services PMI has come in at 54.7, down from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.4, and below the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash reading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 54.9 released in late August. Growth picked up in Ireland and Germany, but slowed in Italy, France and Spain. Lego says its overall performance in the first half of 2017 was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, explaining why it is cutting so many jobs. Revenues declined in established markets such as the United States and in parts of Europe, but it achieved double-digit growth in China Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the topline: Revenue down 5 percent to DKK 14.9 billion compared with DKK 15.7 billion Operating profit down 6 percent to DKK 4.4 billion compared with DKK 4.7 billion Net profit down 3 percent at DKK 3.4 billion compared with DKK 3.5 billion Crumbs. Lego is planning to cut around 1,400 jobs, after suffering a 5% drop in revenues this year. In a statement, LEGO Group Chairman J\u00c3\u00b8rgen Vig Knudstorp says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this. Those steps include sweeping job cuts, that will reduce its global workforce of 18,200 by around 8%. Most of the 1,400 positions will be cut before the end of the year. Knudstorp adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are very sorry to make changes which may interfere with the lives of many of our colleagues. Our colleagues put so much passion into their work every day and we are deeply grateful for that. Unfortunately, it is essential for us to make these tough decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bad news from the bricks economy.... Enigmatically, Lego adds: The Group now prepares to reset the company to deliver on its long-term ambition to reach more children all over the world with LEGO\u00c2\u00ae experiences. Oh dear. Reuters is reporting that UK car sales took another fall in August. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve crunched through some \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpreliminary data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and report demand declined for the fifth month in a row.: British new car sales fell by between 6 and 7 percent year-on-year in August, according to preliminary data released by an industry body on Tuesday. New car registrations have fallen year-on-year in April, May, June and July, the longest run of declines since 2011, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers andTraders (SMMT). The SMMT will publish full data for the month of August at 0800 GMT [9am BST]. August was a rough month for Indian companies, it appears. New tax changes and the controversial demonetization policy both hurt growth, according to the latest PMI reports. The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index hit 47.5 in August, up from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 45.9, but still showing a contraction. Markit, which compiles the survey, says India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Goods and Services Tax (GST) - which replaced a swath of local taxes - hurt spending. Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit warns; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The underlying trend for services is one of uncertainty. Businesses are holding back on investment, leading to falls in employment. At the same time, input costs are increasing and firms are unable to fully pass these on due to competitive pressures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all doom and gloom, however, as activity, new business and employment showed much slower rates of reduction than those noted in the prior survey period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in six months, according to new data released overnight. Data firm Caixin reported that, in August, Chinese business activity expanded at the fastest rate since February. Factories and service sector firms both reported a pick-up in demand, thanks to improving market conditions and a rise in new orders. It may mean that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to avoid a sharp slowdown are paying off. Caixin reports that: Services activity growth strengthens to three-month high, while manufacturing output grows modestly New orders increase at faster pace at both service providers and goods producers Inflationary pressures build further And this pushed its Composite Output Index up to 52.4, up from 51.9 in July. Dr Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group warns, though, that firms are facing higher costs: The recovery in both manufacturing and services has led the economic outlook to continue to improve. But we need to closely watch whether the recent rises in input costs will weigh on corporate profits and fuel inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a flurry of service data from around the world will show how the global economy fared last month. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector contributes around 80% of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output, so the UK services PMI will be closely watched. Economists predict that growth held up OK in August, although after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak construction data (growth at a one-year low!) a negative surprise can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out. The City is confident that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI will beat the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In July we saw a nice uptick to 53.8, after a bit of a slowdown in June, and it is expected that we might see some softening in August back to 53.5, though it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a surprise if we did outperform, particularly in areas that support travel, leisure and tourism. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector is likely to notch up another strong month of growth, with the eurozone PMI expected to hit 54.9. We also get new UK car sales this morning, for August. Sales have fallen for the last four months, and there are fears they could still be dropping.... The markets look quiet this morning, after dipping yesterday amid worries over North Korea. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to rise by a modest 8 points, with traders hopeful that military action can be avoided. Americans will be getting back to work (and pushing their white outfits to the back of the closet) after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labor Day holiday. Several Federal Reserve policy makers are due to speak, and may give hints on when US interest rates may next rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI for August 9am BST: UK car sales for August 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI for August 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for August 3pm BST: US factory orders for July",

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. The future of the US Federal Reserve has been thrown into fresh uncertainty after vice chair Stanley Fischer suddenly resigned. Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early departure may help Trump to reshape the Fed, and could be a sign that chair Janet Yellen won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be reappointed next year. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has surprised the markets with its second interest rate rise in as many months. The BoC raised borrowing costs from 0.75% to 1%, citing the strengthening Canadian economy. Nicholas Wall, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, says the BoC is showing its confidence in the business cycle. Canada has been experiencing a period of above-trend growth, underlined by 4.5% annualised GDP expansion in the second quarter, with more timely data suggesting that economic momentum remains strong. The BoC sees the composition of growth as broad-based and self-sustaining, despite some cooling in the housing market. This backdrop appears to have strengthened the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the output gap has all but closed, meaning it was prepared to tighten policy despite core inflation running about 0.5% below its target.The move sent the Canadian dollar up by over 1.4% to a two-year high. Pressure is mounting on the European Central Bank to cut its bond-buying stimulus programme, following hard-hitting comments from Germany today. John Cryan, the head of Deutsche Bank, warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheap money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is fuelling financial bubbles, while finance minister Wolfgang Schauble said policy should be normalised as the European economy has recovered. Something for the ECB to chew on tonight, ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting.... In the UK, the chairman of Sports Direct has clung onto his job. Only 45% of shareholders opposed Keith Hellawell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-election, despite City concerns over the way the retailer operates. The day began with a surprise fall in German factory orders. They fell by 0.3% in July, due to falling demand from domestic customers and other eurozone members. It may be a sign that the German economy slowed over the summer. European stock markets have ended the day in a mixed position; Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 lost 18 points, or 0.25%, but there were gains in Germany, France and Italy. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the day: It seems clear that risk appetite is struggling to gain a foothold as the market deals with hurricanes, North Korea, administrative struggles in Washington and the surprise resignation of the deputy Fed chair. Flight to safety in government bonds has driven yields lower, and when combined with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish comments from Fed policymaker Brainard, the result has been to put severe pressure on bank stocks. A rate hike from the Bank of Canada has provided the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmove of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the USDCAD exchange rates slumps to its lowest level in over two years. Having been the poster-boy for tighter policy earlier in the year, the Fed is losing ground to others. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting will give us clues as to whether Draghi is about to burnish the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish credentials. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Intriguingly, Stanley Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation comes a few weeks after he criticised efforts to roll back financial regulations. He told the FT that there are worrying signs of a return to the status quo that preceded the financial crisis of 2008. Fischer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took almost 80 years after 1930 to have another financial crisis that could have been of that magnitude. And now after 10 years everybody wants to go back to a status quo before the great financial crisis. And I find that really, extremely dangerous and extremely short-sighted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One can understand the political dynamics of this thing, but one cannot understand why grown intelligent people reach the conclusion that [you should] get rid of all the things you have put in place in the last 10 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US dollar has hit an eight-day low following Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, and the Canadian rate hike. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has paid Stanley Fischer a rather lovely tribute: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been an extraordinary privilege \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and exceptionally good fortune \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for me to have worked closely with Stan Fischer. The combination of his encyclopaedic knowledge of economics, outstanding judgment, quiet leadership and his perennial good humour has helped policymakers around the world to navigate one of the most challenging periods in the global economy. In the years ahead, students and practitioners of macroeconomic policy will continue to draw inspiration from Stan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions at the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Israel, his earlier stellar career at the IMF and his many and varied academic contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Stanley Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation has sent a ripple of excitement through the financial markets. Johan Javeus, chief strategist at SEB Group, says Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement will be significant for monetary policy: Danske Bank points out that the vacancies are piling up at the Fed..... This is from investor Axel Merk. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal points out how influential Fischer has been during his long career: Newsflash! Stanley Fischer, the vice chair of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve central bank, has tendered his resignation. In an unexpected move, Fischer will leave the Fed in mid-October. His term officially expired next June. Fischer cites \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal reasons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in a letter to president Donald Trump. He also says it has been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great pleasure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to serve alongside chair Janet Yellen. Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision means that he certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be succeeding Yellen when her term ends next year (not that this was very likely....). It also gives Trump more control over the Fed, as a new vice chair must now be appointed. Fischer is a highly respected economist and central banker. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously served as chief economist of the World Bank, and governor of the Bank of Israel. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dutch Bank ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap take: With back to back 25bp rate hikes, the Bank of Canada has fully reversed the 2015 policy easing that was spurred by the downturn in commodity prices. How quickly times change. It was just three months ago the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s officials were sounding relaxed about the monetary policy stance, suggesting that there was no hurry to raise rates. But a swift change of tone was followed by a July rate hike and they have now decided to follow up with a further 25bp hike, taking the policy rate back to 1%. ING expect the BoC will leave rates on hold until the end of the year, and raise them twice in 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explanation of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Canadian rate hike: The Bank of Canada is trying to strike a balance between bringing interest rates up to more normal levels amid the strongest growth spurt in more than a decade, and acknowledging the persistence of low inflation and subdued wage pressures. It may also be attempting to restrain market expectations it will get too far ahead of the Federal Reserve. Futures trading suggests investors were anticipating -- before Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decision -- as many as three hikes from the Bank of Canada by the end of 2018, versus one more for the Federal Reserve. The Canadian \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloonie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (so named for the bird that adorns the coin) surged by 1.5% against the US dollar after the rate hike was announced. It hit a high of C$1.2134 against the US dollar, from C$1.241. This is the second Canadian interest rate rate in under two months, and comes after Canada posted its strongest growth in 17 years. In a statement, the Bank of Canada says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent economic data have been stronger than expected, supporting the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that growth in Canada is becoming more broadly based and self-sustaining.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That growth is broad-based, the BoC adds. It cites \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd consumer spending, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd job and income growth, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in exports. But...it could send a shiver though the Canadian housing market. After a long boom, there are signs that the sector is now cooling. In Toronto, prices have fallen by a fifth since April, according to a new survey. Boom! Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has voted to hike interest rates to 1%, from 0.75%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise move, which has sent the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLoonie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or Canadian dollar, soaring against the US. The BoC says it is withdrawing some of its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconsiderable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stimulus, due to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than expected economic performance recently. Given Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing strongly, and house prices have accelerated, there are decent arguments for an interest rate hike. But still, this is a surprise to investors. It will also bring pain to borrowers. In a statement, the BoC says it will pay close attention to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensitivity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the economy to higher interest rates given \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elevated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd household indebtedness. Over in America, the trade gap has widened slightly, and the deficit with China has hit an 11-month high. The Commerce Department has reported that the difference between US imports and exports rose by 0.3% in July to $43.7bn, from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $43.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller rise than expected, with exports dropping by 0.3% and imports by 0.2%. The politically sensitive US-China trade deficit climbed by 3.0% to $33.6 billion in July, the highest level since August 2016. That might normally attract fresh criticism from Donald Trump, but he may be too busy handling North Korea and a stream of hurricanes..... Despite this pressure from Germany, the European Central Bank will be reluctant to trim its bond purchase programme at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. But....waiting too long has its own dangers, and could allow the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbubbles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which John Cryan warned about to get even larger. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at FOREX.com argues that the ECB should take a decision on QE this week, so the markets know what will happen beyond 2017. He writes: In July, the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said that the Governing Council would discuss the future of its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion monthly purchases programme in the autumn. Technically, autumn in the Northern Hemisphere will not start until Friday September 22, so there is a possibility that the topic of QE tapering may not be discussed at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. However, many analysts reckon that an announcement would be made a bit early at this meeting because it coincides with the new ECB staff forecasts. There are a number of reasons why the ECB would want to reduce QE purchases, not least because of bond scarcity. But more importantly, the consequences of acting too late could be very damaging as inflation could spiral out of control. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian King has a good explanation of why the ECB is under fire from Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, and one of its top bankers, today: Pressure is building on the European Central Bank (ECB) to bring Quantitative Easing (QE) to an end - with one of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent bankers today adding to the calls. In an attempt to stimulate demand in the single currency area, the ECB began buying assets in March 2015 at the rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month, paying for it with newly-created electronic money. It raised its purchases to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month in March last year before bringing the figure back down to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn in March this year. At the time the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Mario Draghi, pledged to continue the programme until the end of 2017. However, with the eurozone now enjoying solid growth in most countries and the ECB having bought more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2tn worth of assets, there are growing calls for the programme to be wound up early on the grounds that the job has been done.

Around 53.2% of independent shareholders backed Keith Hellawell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reappointment, with 46.7% opposing it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a narrow result, and even narrower if you note that some shareholders abstained. This vote doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large stake in SPD (last year - Ashley used his vote to save Hellawell from a rebellion). Presumably Hellawell (a former chief constable of West Yorkshire and government drugs tsar) will now carry on at Sports Direct, despite City concerns over its corporate governance. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employers have been falling over each other to criticise the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaked immigration plans. The proposals, reported by the Guardian yesterday, would dramatically cut the number of low-skilled migrants after Brexit by only allowing them to stay for two years. The Food and Drink industry has warned of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccatastrophe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with firms unable to fill posts, while the CBI has called for an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen but managed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 migration system. More here: Over in parliament, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Corbyn has asked prime minister Theresa May to condemn Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to end zero hours contracts. She rather ducked the question, though, pointing out that the Conservatives have taken action against unfair use of zero hours contracts in the past. More here: Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM has wrapped up - now we wait for the results of the shareholder vote. Crucially, chairman Keith Hellawell has promised to step down if a majority of investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back him today. Heads-up! Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has backed John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for an interest rate hike in the eurozone. Speaking (via satellite) at the banking conference in Frankfurt, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble took another swipe at the current ultra-loose monetary policy. He urged the European Central Bank to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy as soon as possible - ie, end its money-printing QE programme and raise borrowing costs. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble said: Unusual monetary policy implies it is not usual or normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we should get back to a normal monetary policy. We have come back to a normal situation much quicker than people thought. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has fired a broadside at the ECB, and its president Mario Draghi. But it does put a little more pressure on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Could it embolden hawkish members to push to tighten policy? City economists are divided on whether the ECB will make a decision to curb its bond-buying programme this month, or delay until October. So it will certainly be an exciting meeting.... We have another no-show at the Sports Direct AGM -- senior independent director Simon Bentley. So chairman Keith Hellawell has faced the music alone -- and rejected a call for an independent review of SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work practices John Cryan has also warned that many bank jobs will be lost as the industry embraces automation. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laura Noonan has the details: Alas, Sports Direct founder and chief executive Mike Ashley isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gracing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM with his presence. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not against the rules -- handling the shareholders is the responsibility of the chairman. SPD has blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conflicting demands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time.... Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Cryan also took a swipe at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of charging negative interest rates on commercial bank deposits. This policy was introduced in Jun 2014; Cryan argues that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone on quite long enough, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be forever that deposit taking is a loss making\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Derbyshire, unions are protesting outside Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholder AGM. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pointing out that SPD hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delivered on the promises made after its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVictorian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working practices were revealed. My colleague Sarah Butler is there, and tweeted these photos: One of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bankers has urged policymakers to end the era of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheap money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and start raising interest rates. John Cryan, CEO of Deutsche Bank, warned that the European Central Bank is helping to fuel a dangerous bubble in the financial markets. He wants the ECB to tighten policy now; it is currently pumping \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new money into the economy each month, and hitting banks with negative interest rates to encourage them to offer credit. Speaking to fellow bankers in Frankfurt this morning, Cryan declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The era of cheap money in Europe should come to an end - despite the strong euro.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This cheap money is driving asset prices to unsustainable levels, he added: We are now seeing signs of bubbles in more and more parts of the capital market. As this chart shows, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet has swelled to record levels thanks to its bond-purchase programme. That QE programme has also driven bond prices to record highs. Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention comes a day before the EBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council sets monetary policy. Economists expect the ECB to hold off tightening policy until October. He also argued that City banks who quit London because of Brexit should head to Germany, as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is only one European city which can fulfil these requirements and that city is Frankfurt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City traders are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to the North Korean crisis, says David Madden of CMC Markets. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running scared, but they are a touch on the nervous side, and while the situation keeps rumbling on, dealers could be reluctant to start a fresh round of buying. Russian president Valdimir Putin has now weighed in, saying fresh sanctions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the answer and would only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153push Pyongyang into a corner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now this is more encouraging. German shoppers boosted their spending in August, suggesting that consumer confidence is still robust. The monthly Retail PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, jumped to 53.0 last month from 50.7 in July. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak factory orders and the North Korean crisis worry investors. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has lost 25 points, or 0.33%, with similar falls in France and Germany following the selloff in Asia. Fears that Pyongyang could be preparing another missile test are pushing shares down, and keeping gold near a one-year high. North Korean ambassador Han Tae Song added to concerns yesterday, by warning that the US could receive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more gift packages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. European bank shares are leading the selloff, reflecting caution ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank policy meeting. Attention, travellers! Budget airline Ryanair has shaken up its luggage policy in a bid to deter customers from taking two bags onto their flight. Angela Monaghan explains: Ryanair customers will have to pay \u00c2\u00a35 for priority boarding from 1 November if they want to carry a wheelie bag on board, as the airline attempts to reduce boarding and flight delays caused by a shortage of overhead cabin space. Priority boarders will still be able to carry on two bags, but all other passengers will only be allowed to take one smaller bag on board the aircraft. A second, larger, wheelie bag will have to be placed in the hold free of charge at the boarding gate, to be collected at baggage reclaim on arrival... Is it just an attempt to raise money? Apparently not - Ryanair say the policy will cost them \u00c2\u00a350m, but hopefully speed things up. More here: Sports Direct has reiterated its bold pledge to become the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Selfridges of Sport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retailing. As it prepares for a potentially bruising AGM meeting today, SPD told the City that: The Company is pleased to confirm ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM that trading in our new generation flagship stores continues to exceed our expectations as Sports Direct moves towards the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSelfridges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of sport. I suspect that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop some investors voting against chairman Keith Hellawell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reappointment, though. Several influential shareholders, including Hermes and Fidelity, argue that fresh blood is needed at the top following recent revelations over the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working practices. German consumer goods makers had the toughest July, suffering a 3% drop in new orders. Capital goods (heavy duty machinery) dropped by 0.7%, while intermediate goods orders fell by 0.4%. This is the first drop in German factory orders in three months, as this chart shows: Just in: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories suffered a surprise drop in new orders in July, suggesting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerhouse economy could be running out of steam. New government figures show that factory orders dropped by 0.7% during the month, missing City forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Orders from other eurozone countries fell by 1% during the month. However, orders from other nations rose by 0.6% -- suggesting the recent strength of the euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurting Germany. But....domestic orders declined by 1.6% - perhaps a sign that German companies are taking a breather after a strong few months? Germany factory orders can be volatile, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly what chancellor Angela Merkel would hope to see ahead of this autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. But the economics ministry insists that German manufacturing remains robust, saying: Order activity remains on a very high level.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are jittery again this morning as the North Korea nuclear crisis weighs on the markets. Asian stocks are dropping today, following a nervy session on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow Jones fall 1%. The selloff comes as South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Moon Jae-in, warned that the crisis on the Korean peninsula risks becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncontrollable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking at a bilateral meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Moon declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The global political situation has become very serious due to North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated provocations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd South Korean media are reporting that Moon asked Putin to help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tame\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd North Korea, following last Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear test. More details here: On the economics front, we find out how whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with the rest of the world widened or narrowed, and how its service sector performed in August. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching two annual general meetings, with retailer Sports Direct and housebuilder Berkeley Group facing their shareholders. Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Keith Hellawell, will face a rebellion from investors who believe he should resign. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility that Canadian interest rates could rise today, as the Bank of Canada holds its latest monetary policy meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 1.30pm: US trade balance for July 3pm: Bank of Canada interest rate decision 3pm: US service sector PMI for August",

                "bodyText":"And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always interesting to see which press conference clips the ECB choose to plug over twitter.... How longer might the eurozone experience record low interest rates, currently set at zero percent? Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons they could last for at least another year, and possible rather longer. She writes: The ECB kept its forward guidance on interest rates and asset purchases, namely that interest rates are expected to remain at their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With no changes to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy sequencing (QE vs rates) under discussion, the guidance now means that rates will not be raised until after the end of asset purchases, which is likely to be late 2018 or early 2019 at the earliest. European stock markets have ended the day higher. The FTSE 100 gained 0.6%, or 42 points, at 7,398. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gained 0.67%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC rose by 0.25%. The euro is bobbing around the $1.20 mark too, up almost one euro cent today, following the news that the ECB has started discussing how to tackle its stimulus programme. Joshua Mahony of IG says: Draghi managed to keep the euro gains relatively contained today, with the talk of extremely accommodative policy dampening early gains for the single currency. With Draghi due to set out his stall for how the ECB will embark of its QE tapering in October, the big question is whether tapering will begin in 2017 or 2018. Marilyn Watson, head of global fundamental fixed income strategy at BlackRock, predicts that the ECB will end its QE programme by next December. Given the currency bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improving fundamental backdrop and recent impressive data releases, particularly in Germany, not to mention the shortage of supply of bonds to buy, we believe that the ECB will fully taper its asset purchase programme by the end of 2018. Adrian Hilton, head of global rates and currency at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, says Mario Draghi was more relaxed than some investors expected today: At its present level, at least, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to think the euro threatens the medium term inflation objective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As it is, we think this leaves the ECB on track to taper its asset purchases from the start of next year, although we may have to wait until the October meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or maybe longer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to see the details. Were the euro to push on towards the 1.25 level versus the dollar, however, the bank may find itself trapped between a disinflationary exchange rate and a need to phase out its QE purchases before it runs out of bonds to buy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the euro are significant, says Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi acknowledged that the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explosive strength this year is a source of uncertainty and worth monitoring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The key message from Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference is that the ECB is getting ready to slow its stimulus programme, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in a rush. President Draghi tried to be as vague as possible, while sticking to his pledge to decide the future of its bond-buying programme this autumn. He confirmed that the governing council had begun \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery preliminary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talks about how the quantitative easing programme might be changed; how much longer it might run, and how much it might pump into the euro economy. This was the key statement from the ECB chief: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will announce when we are ready. We think we are going to be ready for much of what we have to decide in October ... if we are not then we postpone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Traders have taken this as a sign that QE will be toned down from its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month pace from January. Crucially, Draghi didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too alarmed by the strength of the euro - claiming at one stage that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know where the single currency was trading today (it peaked at $1.2059 during his press conference). He also stated several times that interest rates will remain at their present record lows for a long time - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to reassure households and businesses. Meanwhile in Athens, French president Emmanuel Macron has begun talks with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras. In his first hour of official contact with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of state, the French leader praised Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 austerity reforms and repeated calls for the indebted country to finally be given debt relief. Meanwhile, anti-austerity groups, including breakaway militants from Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Syriza party, have announced they will defy a ban on demonstrations and take to the streets in protest against the mass sell-off of state assets around which much of the visit will focus. The far leftists, many members of the Popular Unity party, have called the ban - part of draconian security measures in the capital - an insult against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the democratic freedoms of the Greek people and first of all the right of peaceful protest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Popular Unity will not be disciplined by government and police arbitrariness ... Greece is not for sale. Workers are not, and will not, become slaves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The demonstration will take place around 6pm local time - ahead of Macron outlining his vision for Europe in a speech from the ancient Pnyx. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has helpfully fired over this neat list of the key points from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBulk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of QE decisions to be taken at October meeting EZ growth stable and broad based - GDP outlook revised up to 2.2% in 2017, best growth since 2007 Medium-term inflation projections revised lower chiefly due to euro appreciation Measures of underlying inflation have ticked up but remain at very subdued levels Broad \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdissatisfaction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with inflation, but this is tempered by confidence that inflation will eventually converge with target Most members reiterated worries about exchange rate pressures first raised by some policymakers at the last meeting Appreciation of euro has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunquestionably\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 led to tightening of financial conditions ECB monitoring euro exchange rate, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem overly concerned about overshoot at present. (Could change if EURUSD hits $1.25?) Interest rates will remain at present levels well past end of QE finishes; ECB still stands ready to increase the QE programme in terms of size and/or duration No discussions on scarcity of bonds (seems unlikely), Draghi says ECB has repeatedly shown it can cope with scarcity issue Draghi keen to stress that patience is needed, wont \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperiment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with interest rate forecasts Draghi reiterated need for structural reforms to be substantially stepped up ECB not resigned to permanently low inflation, expects convergence with target sooner or later EURUSD rises above 1.20 handle to retest August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 \u00c2\u00bd year highs Wilson adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mission largely accomplished: Mario Draghi successfully guided the market to expect a tapering announcement in October without sounding hawkish. And finally, a question from a journalist from German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. Q: Do you have any information about the negative side effects of the quantitative easing programme that you can share with us? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The negative side effects of the quantitative easing programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd repeats Draghi slowly, perhaps aghast at the very suggestion that his precious scheme might not be an unmitigated triumph. We simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any side-effects, he insists, and any potential side-effects are vastly overwhelmed by the positive effects of the bond-buying scheme. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Q: What decisions do you think will be taken about your QE stimulus scheme in October? We discussed a set of different scenarios today, Draghi replies. They centred on the different lengths and sizes that the bond-buying programme could run at, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrade offs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between those two factors. In other words, the ECB is starting to talk about how much money it might want to pump into the economy from January 2017, and for how much longer it might be needed. Q: Your inflation forecasts only run up until 2019, but what do you think will happen in 2020? I expect we will meet all our targets in 2020, smiles Draghi - without mentioning that his term will have expired by then. Asked about Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans, Draghi says France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market reforms should aim at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elimination of dualism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the issue where new hires have weaker labour rights than long-serving workers, so they are laid off when a recession hits. Q: Why is monetary policy so loose, when the economy is on track to grow much faster than in recent years? Mario Draghi points to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big labour market slack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to justify today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low interest rates. He adds that the ECB doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dual mandate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like the Federal Reserve, so it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider issues like unemployment. It just has to focus on price stability. Q: What does Mr Draghi think of Estonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to launch its own state-backed cryptocurrency? No eurozone country can launch its own currency, Draghi insists. Q: Should we just accept that eurozone inflation won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get back to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target? Not at all, Draghi replies. We just need \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfidence, patience and persistence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 while the recovery in the economy feeds through to prices. Now a question about the future of the eurozone. Q: What powers should any future eurozone finance ministry have? Member states have realised how incomplete our monetary union is, and how it made the eurozone crisis worse than it would have been We should welcome that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomplex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 discussion, says Draghi. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready to help, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not part of it. Q: Are you concerned that the euro is trading above the levels at which your forecasts were drawn up ($1.18)? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how much it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, Draghi replies, before peeking at a note from his communications director, Christine Graeff.... ... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told its $1.20, well OK, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on exchange rate levels anyway. A journalist tries to lure the ECB president into commenting about the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength, by asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessor Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to comment on when a strong currency becomes a problem. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the exchange rate, Draghi replies firmly. I left university a long time ago, longer than I care to remember. Draghi now denies that the eurozone is in a period of high uncertainty while the ECB plots its next move. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re simply discussing what to do next year, when our present programme expires, he adds. Q: What steps must the ECB take to ensure that banks who move from the City to the eurozone after Brexit are supervised properly, as such big banks bring big risks? Draghi volleys this question to his deputy, V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple - we are prepared, Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio replies. The ECB already regulators large investment banks, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no specific difficulties will come from this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Are you worried about bubbles in the financial markets? (an issue raised by Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Cryan yesterday) No, says Draghi. He does single out the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprime commercial real estate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market, saying valuations look stretched. But even here, there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signs that leverage is increasing (higher leverage is a big warning sign that a bubble is forming, as shown in the 1929 crash). Q: Do you take national government issues into account when deciding how and when to taper QE? We act according to our mandate, Mario Draghi replies. Q: So the German elections aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a factor? No. The euro has soared over $1.20, gaining more than 1.2 cents to $1.2040. Speaking of batting balls away.... The bulk of our decisions about our asset purchase programme will be taken in October, Draghi says, in response to another question about QE. Q: So will we get a full roadmap in October, saying how you might reduce the pace of the programme. Have you a personal preference? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, smiles Draghi, batting this ball safely away. Q: And have you discussed the issue of bond scarcity? No, says Draghi, We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shown we can cope with this issue successfully. Onto questions. Q: Did you have any discussions about the future of QE today? And is the euro a problem at its current level? Mario Draghi embarks on a long answer, which threatens to take up the entire press conference. All members of the governing council spoke about three issues today, Draghi replies, growth, inflation and the exchange rate. On growth, there was agreement that the economy was strengthening with six million new jobs created since the crisis. But there must be patience.... On inflation, there was a small downward revision \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdue to the exchange rate appreciation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Draghi says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad dissatisfaction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the inflation rate today. On the exchange rate, although exports are doing well today the euro FX rate will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So there were concerns expressed by a number of members about the euro, and discussion about whether its current value really reflected the strength of the eurozone economy But the exchange rate is not a target, he says firmly (a familiar line from the Central Bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 handbook) Draghi then circles back to the first question -- saying there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very preliminary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discussion about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase scheme, and the pros and cons of different scenarios. We want to see the work from the committees who are tasked to work on this, he adds, before taking any decisions. In conclusion, Draghi repeats the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to leave interest rates at their present or lower rate for an extended period. Putting on his serious voice, Draghi declares that the implementation of structural reforms needs to be stepped up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nudge to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to do their bit. Newsflash: The ECB has raised its growth forecast for 2017, and cut its inflation forecast in 2018 and 2019. Draghi sound cautious on inflation, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore inflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has yet to show a convincing pickup. Headline inflation could turn negative towards the end of the year, he adds. That could be a signal that the ECB is taking a dovish view, and will be reluctant to tighten monetary policy. But the euro is rising...to $1.1992 (up 0.7 of a cent today). Boom! Draghi says that the ECB will decide on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calibration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its policy beyond 2017 later this year. That confirms that the governing council hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made a decision on how to taper its stimulus programme yet. Despite the recovery, the eurozone still needs a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial degree of monetary support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi continues. Hello! Draghi says that ECB is watching the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility carefully, as it is a source of uncertainty. ECB president Mario Draghi begins his press conference by reading out today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement (details here). He says that ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook for the eurozone economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly unchanged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad-based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recovery is underway across all countries and sectors. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mario time.... Reuters correspondent Francesco Canepa reckons the strength of the euro deterred the ECB from tightening monetary policy today.... City traders will now be scrambling for a quick sandwich before the main event of the day, Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference in 30 minutes Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement was unchanged, Draghi could still surprise us when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asked about the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking around its stimulus programme. Plus, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get those new inflation and GDP forecasts. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet bank suspects that Draghi will reveal that ECB staff are working on possible QE changes. Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of investing app Invstr, says the ECB was right to leave interest rates on hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ECB is conscious of lagging inflation rates and will not want to see a further rise in the Euro for fear of stifling economic recovery, which is largely driven by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement from the European Central Bank may sound curiously familiar. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a case of deja vu. The ECB has simply repeated July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, while taking the time to tweak the date. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, the European Central Bank has not made any changes to its stimulus programme. Instead, it is maintaining its promise to buy \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new bonds each month until at least the end of December 2017. And it also promises to boost the programme if needed, to keep inflation on track. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key part of the statement: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB also says that it expects to leave its interest rate at their present levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a change of policy, though. Breaking! The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged across the eurozone, at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing cost remains at 0.0%. And banks will still be charged a negative interest rate, of minus 0.4%, when they leave money in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronic vaults. That is meant to encourage them to lend to consumers and businesses. But what about QE?..... European stock markets are still up, too: With the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision just moments away, the euro is up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.1975. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of what the markets are looking for from the ECB today: 1) What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the QE plan? Traders want to hear clues about how the ECB will handle its bond-buying programme beyond December. Currently it is buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of bonds per month; will we hear plans to taper it in January? 2) Will Draghi express any concern about the strong euro? Famously the exchange rate isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a formal target, but that might not prevent the ECB president pointing out that a higher exchange rate can push down inflation. 3) What are the new staff forecasts? ECB economists have been beavering away for weeks, drawing up new growth and inflation projections. They should influence (but not dictate) how the ECB plots its actions over the next few months. 4) Will it change its QE parameters? Put simply, the ECB is running out of bonds to buy, having energetically stimulating the eurozone economy since early 2015. A rule change could give it more leeway to buy debt from certain countries. Tensions is mounting.... European stock markets are pushing higher, with traders citing relief that America has avoided the danger of a default later this month. Wall Street and the City have been cheered by the (rare) sight of Donald Trump clinching a deal with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, to extend the debt ceiling by three months. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote bank says the deal may show that Trump can get things done after all: The real news was Trump working with Democrats. In rare bipartisan deal, Trump, Republicans and Democrats extended the U.S. debt limit and provided government funding until Dec. 15th. Should the Republican-led Congress pass the bill, the 3-month deal would prevent an extraordinary default on U.S. government debt and keep the government funded for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. This was a massive first step. True, it was tied to relief assistance for victims of Hurricane Harvey, but still, the path towards meaningful tax reform (and potentially other stimulus) just got a little less steep. We were perhaps premature in writing off the Trump pro-growth, reflation story \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift to the center, highlighted by this 3-month extension, could be the start of something real. A unified US government could have profound effects on our market outlook. Emmanuel Macron has touched down in Athens to begin his visit to the Greek capital... Higher still and higher goes the euro.... That means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further to fall if the ECB fails to make any new decisions on its stimulus programme today. Over in Athens, draconian security measures are being taken ahead of the French president Emmanuel Macron making his first official visit to the the country. More than 2,000 police officers have been seconded around the city centre - including 700 special forces - as Greece prepares to lay out red carpet for the leader of the country that he stood by it throughout the euro zone crisis. Helena Smith reports from Athens The French president is due to arrive at Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 international airport, accompanied by his wife Brigitte, his economy and Europe ministers and the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of 40 investment-hungry French companies (from the French energy company Total to small independent start-ups) at 1:30pm local time. A massive security operation, on a par with that put in place when the former US president Barack Obama visited the Greek capital last November, has gone into action - with sirens going off in the Greek capital already. The stepped up measures come as police hunt for the perpetrators of an attack on the French Institute last night. Two men on a motorbike are believed to have thrown black pain at the building late around 10 PM - the second such attack in the last year. The two-day visit is being seen as perhaps the most important trip by a foreign leader to Greece this year with government sources describing it as having huge symbolic capital for both countries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The future of Europe, investment programs, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load and how we can boost growth will all be on the table,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a government source told the Guardian. Macron will become the first foreign leader to give an address from the ancient Pnyx - where Pericles made his famous funeral oration - this evening. The theme will be Europe and his vision for the continent. Meanwhile the French leader has sent a message of support to the country ahead of the visit, in which he has spoken of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to exit its long-running debt crisis. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the euro zone was unthinkable, he told the leading Greek daily Kathimerini. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Greek exit would signal, sooner or later, the end of the euro ... the best way to avoid the exit of any member state is to draw up an ambitious plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery: New figures have confirmed that the eurozone economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of this year. Britain and Portugal were the slowest members, with both economies growing by just 0.3% between April and June. Other countries sparkled, though; the Czech Republic grew by a blistering 2.5% in the quarter, followed by Sweden with 1.7% growth. Eurostat, which compiled the data, reports that household spending rose by 0.5% in the euro area, while investment (or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) rose by 0.9%. Exports rose by 1.1% in the euro area, while imports increased by 0.9%. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, warns that the euro could tumble if Mario Draghi is more cautious than expected today. He writes: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect Mario to come out swinging today, but it may only require a tweak of CPI projections, casual reference of a high Euro or hint that QE normalisation talks are underway which could whip markets into a frenzy. If ECB were to downgrade economic projections, it would be in line with Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doubt that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflationary run remains self-sustainable. Markets would likely take this as strong clue that QE normalisation is pushed well back into 2018 and Euro could find itself under remarkable pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Excitingly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no clear consensus on what the European Central Bank will do at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Several experts think the decision on its stimulus progamme could be delayed until October, while the ECB is also expected to raise its growth forecasts and cut its inflation ones. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets expects Mario Draghi to confirm that the governing council discussed how to trim, or taper, its bond purchasing scheme. We have less than four months left before the ECB asset purchase program ends, and the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi is reticent about the future path of the monetary policy. Month after month, the tapering process has been delayed while the recovery in the Eurozone has strengthened. The patient is not sick and there is no need for the lifeline.... Forget about pulling a rabbit out of the hat, when it comes to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting on Thursday, I expect the statement to be immensely tailor-made. It is widely expected that the ECB would say that they have officially discussed the process of tapering in the light of their latest economic projections. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi predicts that the ECB will delay the big decision on slowing its stimulus programme until next month. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, says the ECB could pull the trigger on QE today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ECB president Mario Draghi will give his most keenly awaited speech for a while this lunchtime as traders bet whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll finally confirm plans to cool the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the eurozone economy growing consistently and inflation higher, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly a strong argument to reduce monthly bond-buying from the current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion. However, with the euro still firmly above $1.19, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong feeling that Draghi will delay any decision until October at the earliest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics predicts that the ECB will cut its inflation forecasts -- which seems plausible, as the euro has strengthened since June. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says the strengthening euro has complicated the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dilemma: The crucial question facing the ECB is whether Mario Draghi will announce the date of cutting bond purchases. The decision to taper asset purchases was widely expected to occur in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, after Mr. Draghi hinted on 20 July that the discussion on tapering assets should take place in Autumn. Since then, the Euro has appreciated by more than 4.8% against the dollar, but declined slightly after peaking at $1.2069. Technically, the Autumn season starts towards the end of September, so even if Mr. Draghi decided to delay the announcement of tapering the asset purchase program, this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect his credibility. However, the day of the announcement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only key driver of the Euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the game plan going forward. The euro is continuing to rise against the US dollar, as traders wonder whether the ECB will take a decision on tapering its stimulus programme today. Surprise! British house prices rose by a positively perky 1.1% in August, according to the Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading in eight months. However, prices are still only 0.1% higher over the last quarter as a whole, following a decline in June. The annual rate (a better measure) came at +2.6%, compared to 2.1% a month ago. It touched 10% back in 2016, before tailing off recently. Newsflash from Sweden: The Riksbank has left interest rates unchanged at their current record low of -0.5%. European stock markets have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 gaining 11 points or 0.15%. The euro is creeping higher in early trading, up 0.2% to $1.1935, as traders await news from the ECB. This table from ING shows how the euro could react to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for the eurozone, as the European Central Bank meets to set monetary policy. Top of the agenda - how, and when, to end the stimulus programme that is pumping more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 trillion into the euro economy. Back in July, ECB president Mario Draghi promised us a decision on its quantitative easing programme \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin the fall, or in the autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And with the nights drawing in, the issue needs to be tackled soon. Currently, the ECB is committed to buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of government and corporate bonds each month with newly created money, until the end of 2017. So economists and traders are eager to know what will happen when the clock ticks past midnight on December 31. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the ECB will decide to trim the pace of the programme, perhaps to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn per month from January, in an attempt to wean the markets off its stimulus without causing a crash. BUT... we might not get the big decision today. The ECB could defer the decision until its October meeting, leaving us in suspense for a few more weeks. Draghi may also take the opportunity to talk about the strength of the euro, which hit an eight-year high against the pound last month. Konstantinos Anthis in the ADS Securities research team reckons Draghi has three options. The first is that the ECB will announce a full-scale tapering of their purchases by 50 billion which would give a massive push to the Euro that will rally towards $1.21 and also change its outlook to clearly positive. The second option is that the ECB will announce a smaller scale reduction of their program - possibly by 20 billion or so - which would be positive for the single currency, and could send the euro above $1.20 but the mixed reaction from the market would mean that gains would be capped; and finally the third possibility would be the ECB postpones the tapering for a month or more which would be clearly negative for the euro and would send it tumbling towards or even below $1.18. So we can expect plenty of volatility when the ECB shows its hand. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance that the governing council will raise interest rates from their current record lows, despite Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO calling for the end of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheap money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yesterday. The ECB will also publish its new growth and inflation forecasts today, for the first time since June. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatter that it could raise its growth predictions a little, but trim its inflation outlook. The financial markets look calm this morning, with some relief that a short-term deal has been hammered out on the US debt ceiling  . We also get a new survey of UK house prices this morning, which could show if the market is cooling. Plus, updated eurozone growth figures which will probably confirm that the region expanded by a punchy 0.6% in the April to June quarter.

Muscular common sense and a sound grasp of markets, which are all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really required of a financial regulator, have returned. But if Bailey wants to keep this better image for the FCA he will have to find a way to abandon the proposal to rewrite the listing rules to make it easier for Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-owned oil company, Aramco, to float in London. The investment community hates the idea and the heat on the FCA will intensify now that the chairs of the Treasury and business select committees are asking pointed questions about ministerial interference. Naturally, the FCA doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe its idea as a sop to the Saudis. In its view, its work is all about updating the rules and keeping London competitive. Aramco isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even mentioned in the paper. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that almost nobody else sees this as a bland technical exercise. Furious fund managers sense a bad case of a regulator planning to lower standards to suit ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 short-term desire to persuade Aramco to float in London rather than New York. The investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 objection is straightforward: why on earth would we want to create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd listing category for state-owned companies while not enforcing normal investor protections? Under the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, the likes of Aramco would be allowed to ignore some basic principles. They would not have to get approval from outside shareholders for transactions with the state. They would not have to give independent shareholders a vote on who should serve as independent directors. There clearly could be a place for such companies in London, but you would hardly award \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status, a label that is meant to indicate the highest governance protections. The regulatory regime would look like a pushover, which may succeed in drumming up some short-term business but could seriously damage London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a good place to invest. Bailey and the FCA should read the mood. Resistance to the proposal is deep and wide, and rightly so. There is room to backtrack since only a consultation paper has been issued so far. The sooner the U-turn happens, the better. What goes up must come down \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 surely? When the government in February lowered the Ogden rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a discount formula used to calculate compensation payments for victims of serious injuries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 2.5% to minus 0.75%, the chief executive of one large insurance company called the decision the worst piece of policymaking he had seen in his career. He was not a disinterested observer since the rejig threatened to cost insurers (and also the NHS, which is exposed to claims for medical errors) a lot of money in the form of substantially higher payouts to victims who need lifetime support. But he had a point. A negative Ogden rate implied recipients could expect to receive negative returns on their lump sums. Even in a low-interest world, that defied common sense. The culprit, explained Liz Truss, the justice secretary at the time, was low long-term gilt yields. Her hands were tied by a long-established formula for setting Ogden. Her successor, David Lidington, thinks his hands are freer. He proposes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new framework based on how claimants actually invest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That seems reasonable, especially if, as the government suggests, the new calculation produces a suitably conservative figure between 0% and 1%. The insurance companies, when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stopped celebrating, should tell us by how much car insurance premiums will fall. They screamed blue murder in February and used Ogden to justify rises in premiums, especially for young drivers. Cuts in premiums must now be seen to arrive. Two choices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one bad luck, one duff It is sweet and commendable of the fund manager Neil Woodford to apologise to his followers for his miserable investment performance of late. Most of his breed would sit in a bunker. Hiding would be tricky in Woodford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, of course. Not only is he the most famous (rightly so) retail fund manager in the land, but he has also been at the scene of too many stock market accidents recently, notably FTSE 100 firms AstraZeneca and Provident Financial. That does require an explanation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that Woodford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is odd. While conceding that heavy falls at both companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two of his largest exposures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have not helped,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he delivered a sermon about how the stock market is currently obsessed by stocks with exposure to China. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting theme (as is the statistic that just eight big stocks account for half the gains in the FTSE all share index this year) but his UK focus hardly explains the rotten run. Everybody knew AstraZeneca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were bound to move 10% or more, up or down, depending on the result of the Mystic lung cancer trial. As for Provident Financial, surely nobody expects a quiet life from a doorstep lender making high-interest loans. Call it one piece of bad luck and one duff, or over-aggressive, stock pick. It happens.",

Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpain and suffering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the insurance costs of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come. Florida is also a key supplier of agricultural produce to the US and wider market, not least orange-juice.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that the overall impact of the hurricane season will negatively affect US Q3 GDP, but boost Q4 and Q1 as the rebuilding effort gets into full swing. On the flip side, near-term inflation is likely to rise, not least as a result of higher gasoline prices. The combination of these two contrasting impacts leaves the Federal Reserve with an interesting dilemma over the remaining months of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-11T09:17:20.869Z\">at 10.17am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59b64bbbe4b0e3ccf89ec6ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-11T08:50:12.771Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bailout monitors return to Greece as PM charms China</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc7c9552d859cfac87ad50ffd4639e5fc41433a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efc7c9552d859cfac87ad50ffd4639e5fc41433a/0_205_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bunch of balloons are tied to a gate next to a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk in central Athens yesterday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bunch of balloons are tied to a gate next to a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk in central Athens yesterday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over in Greece technical teams of auditors representing the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are flying in to prepare the ground for what officials are hoping will be a last and problem-free bailout review.</p> <h2>Helena Smith reports from Athens</h2> <p>What amounts to the beginning of a third bailout review begins on a very different note.</p> <p>The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants the compliance audit to be wrapped up imminently, telling delegates attending the international Thessaloniki trade fair this weekend that his leftist-led administration wants it completed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with great speed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In his annual speech outlining the economic policies his government will adopt, Tsipras emphasised what he had repeatedly said during the French president Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Athens last week: that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is turning a page\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with growth and development after seven years of recession.</p> <p>Tsipras insisted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - ejection from the eurozone - had been replaced by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grinvest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as investor interest, the key to combatting unemployment, had surged.</p> <p>It is a far cry from the days when the young leftist firebrand vowed to stop the sell-off of Greece. </p> <p>China was the guest of honour at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thessaloniki fair, with more than 160 Chinese firms represented. Tsipras opened his speech saying Chinese investors were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Greece. </p> <p>Foreign investment, he said, was vital to tackling joblessness, with youth unemployment still running at 40% in Greece.

                "bodyText":"A late PS: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 index has closed at a new all-time high tonight. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1%, or 26 points, to 2,488.11 points, led by insurers, other financial firms, and tech stocks. The Dow Jones posted its biggest one-day jump since March. The rally was driven by relief that Hurricane Irma appears to have caused less damage than the worst-case scenarios. Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Barbara Kollmeyer sums up the day: Wall Street optimism was underpinned by Hurricane Irma delivering a less forceful hit on Florida than expected and North Korea failing to conduct another nuclear missile test over the weekend, reviving investor appetite for assets perceived as risky, such as equities. But...Irma has still caused terrible damage to areas such as the Florida Keys, where homes have been destroyed and people are left without power and water. In Miami, roads have been turned into rivers, even though the eye of the storm missed the City. And we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the final death toll. Associated Press reports that 41 people have been killed since Irma first struck the Caribbean. And finally, European stock markets have closed in a flurry of green electronic ink, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief rally runs its course. Every major indices has risen today, thanks to two factors; the absence of fresh missile tests from North Korea, and signs that Hurricane Irma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total damage will come in below forecasts. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 0.5% higher at 7413, a one-week high, up 35 points. In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 233 points, or just over 1%, at 22,033. That means world markets, as measured by MSCI, are at all time highs as London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector winds down for the day. Insurance companies continued to recover today - with Lancashire Holdings jumping by 10% in the City, and larger firms also recovering. David Madden of CMC Markets credits the latest news from Florida: The timing of Hurricane Irma wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great seeing as it quickly followed the tropical storm Harvey. Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm, and even though it has caused a considerable amount of destruction, it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been as bad the markets were expecting. This also added to the bullish sentiment today, since the cost of the clean-up will be less than expected. Insurers like Aviva, Prudential and Legal &amp; General are all higher today as the payouts relating to Irma are likely to be below initial estimates. The situation in Florida remains very serious, of course, with some officials warning of a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153humanitarian crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following the massive hurricane. But in the financial markets, orange juice and cotton future prices are recovering on hopes that the economic damage will be containable.. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buying frenzy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - although London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally was held back because the pound has rallied 0.5% agains the euro. Beauchamp adds: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action marks a step change from a week ago, when fears of conflict on the Korean peninsula drove equities lower. Now normal service has apparently resumed, with triple digit gains on the Dow and the Dax. The FTSE is making heavy going of it, however, as sterling continues to gain ground versus the US dollar. The pound shows little nervousness so far ahead of a big week for UK data, and even the prospect of voting on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU withdrawal bill has not deterred the buyers. The debate around that bill is raging now: So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The rally on the US stock market has legs; every sector on the S&amp;P 500 index is now up on the day, with insurance firms leading the charge. Orange juice futures contracts are dropping, as traders respond to signs that Irma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause as much damage to Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s citrus industry as feared. OJ futures are down 3% today, but that still means they are 9% more expensive than a week ago. Florida is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest orange producer, so the hurricane damage to crops will have a knock-on impact on prices. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is pushing world stock levels to fresh record highs. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All Country World Index is now up 0.75% today at 483.12 points, a fresh record level. The All Country World Index tracks around 2,400 stocks traded in 47 countries, so is a good gauge of equity levels around the world. After a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence to mark 9/11, trading is underway on Wall Street. And shares are rallying, matching today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones index has gained 163 points, or 0.75%, with nearly every share rising. Travel firms such as Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival are among the top risers, reflecting hopes that Hurricane Irma will not be quite as severe as feared. Financial stocks and tech companies are also leading the way higher. The US dollar is also in favour, gaining almost 0.5% against other currencies today. Newsflash: Google has launched an appeal against the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn fine imposed by the European Union in June for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market. More here. The uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit form the EU hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shaken London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a financial powerhouse, according to a new report: The British pound is creeping higher this morning, as traders prepare for an influx of data later this week - and an interest rate decision. Sterling has nudged $1.321 against the US dollar, close to a five-week high. Tomorrow, the UK inflation rate is expected to rise to 2.8%, from 2.6% in July. That might refocus minds at the Bank of England about the possibility of raising borrowing costs from their current record low. The BoE meets on Thursday; the City doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a hike, but policymakers could hint that rates will rise faster than economists expect. Shares are expected to rally in New York, when trading begins in 90 minutes time. Rising share prices seems like an odd reaction to the devastation caused by Irma in the Caribbean and in Florida. But Wall Street had been bracing for even more damage. Our Hurricane Irma liveblog explains that Florida dodged a bullet: Florida can thank Cuba, where it did hit as a Category 5 storm, said Maue and Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground. Irma would probably have hit Florida as a Category 5 hurricane if it had missed Cuba, Masters said. The storm briefly trekked over Cuba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low populated coast Friday evening through Saturday afternoon. That weakened Irma enough that when upper level winds from the west eroded some of the storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top and also blew in dry air, it had the combined of effect of making Irma more ragged, Masters said. It was at that point, he said, that Irma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southwest eyewall sort of came apart, no longer a perfect circle on satellite imagery. Slightly weakened from Cuba, the storm got caught up in competing weather systems a little longer, delaying its northward right turn into Florida. And that delay pushed the track further west, making it more of a threat to Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s west coast than its east. Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate, BGC Partners, are holding their annual Charity Day, raising money for a wide range of good causes. The Charity Day was set up to remember the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald workers, and 61 employees of Eurobrokers employees, who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 16 years ago today. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York headquarters was based in the North tower of the World Trade Centre. Cantor and BGC distribute 100% of their global revenues on Charity Day to the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and dozens of charities around the world. Over in Canary Wharf, a steady stream of celebrities - and the Mayor of London - have been raising money by trying their hand at trading.... The latest word from Florida is that 5.78 million homes are currently without power, or almost 60% of the state. But despite this disruption, there is relief that Irma has weakened since making landfall, and may not wreck as much havoc as some experts estimated. Daiwa Capital Markets strategist Chris Scicluna said (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The good news was that the eye of Hurricane Irma took a path west of Miami and has since weakened to a Category 1 storm so that damage in Florida \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whilst still severe... appears not to be quite as catastrophic as had been feared last week. And thankfully there was no bad weekend news out of North Korea either.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest: North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president can take the credit for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market rally, says Joshua Mahony of City firm IG: On a day that is largely devoid of any major economic releases of note, it is Kim Jong-Un who provides the unlikely source of bullish sentiment evident throughout global markets this morning. With North Korea celebrating the anniversary of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formation over the weekend, it has come as a surprise that we did not see a third consecutive weekend test from Kim Jong-Un. But this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism could be tempered by a meeting of the United Nations later today, when the UN will vote on whether to impose new sanctions on North Korea. Mahony explains: Given that North Korea has provided one of the main drivers of volatility in recent weeks, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UN meeting over the potential implementation of further sanctions on the country will be crucial in gauging how likely we are to see further tests in the near future. With the US pushing for an oil embargo on North Korea, the Chinese and Russian decisions will be key, where their cooperation would be a kick in the teeth for Pyongyang leadership, sparking a likely military response. Newsflash: World stock markets have just hit a record high. Shares are continuing to climb in Asia and Europe, on relief that North Korea didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t conduct another missile test last weekend. Hopes that Hurricane Irma will be less devastating than feared are also pushing equities higher, with insurance companies among the top risers today (as mentioned earlier). Munich Re, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest reinsurance firms, are up over 4% this morning. The All Country World Share Index calculated by data firm MSCI has gained 0.35% to 481.25 points, helped by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains in Asia and Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 53 points at 7431, a one-week high. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at Interactive Investor, says the City is less worried about North Korea as economists try to assess the full impact of the hurricane season. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdEquity markets are staging a relief rally after a less painful weekend than feared. Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpain and suffering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the insurance costs of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come. Florida is also a key supplier of agricultural produce to the US and wider market, not least orange-juice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that the overall impact of the hurricane season will negatively affect US Q3 GDP, but boost Q4 and Q1 as the rebuilding effort gets into full swing. On the flip side, near-term inflation is likely to rise, not least as a result of higher gasoline prices. The combination of these two contrasting impacts leaves the Federal Reserve with an interesting dilemma over the remaining months of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Greece technical teams of auditors representing the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are flying in to prepare the ground for what officials are hoping will be a last and problem-free bailout review. Helena Smith reports from Athens What amounts to the beginning of a third bailout review begins on a very different note. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants the compliance audit to be wrapped up imminently, telling delegates attending the international Thessaloniki trade fair this weekend that his leftist-led administration wants it completed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with great speed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In his annual speech outlining the economic policies his government will adopt, Tsipras emphasised what he had repeatedly said during the French president Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Athens last week: that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is turning a page\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with growth and development after seven years of recession. Tsipras insisted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - ejection from the eurozone - had been replaced by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grinvest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as investor interest, the key to combatting unemployment, had surged. It is a far cry from the days when the young leftist firebrand vowed to stop the sell-off of Greece. China was the guest of honour at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thessaloniki fair, with more than 160 Chinese firms represented. Tsipras opened his speech saying Chinese investors were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Greece. Foreign investment, he said, was vital to tackling joblessness, with youth unemployment still running at 40% in Greece. It could also help ameliorate the brain drain that had seen the best minds leave since the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great economic crisis began. The government hopes that the latest review will be concluded by December so that Athens can successfully exit its current bailout program on time next August. In private, however, officials are voicing fears that creditor demands may get in the way. Troubled construction company Carillion has suffered fresh upheaval; Zafar Khan, its group finance director, has left the Company with immediate effect. Shares in Carillion are down almost 5%. Khan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure comes two months after Carillion shocked the City with a big profits warning, partly due to problems with three public-private partnerships. Gold has lost its appeal this morning, as traders pile into riskier assets. Bullion has dropped by around 1%, or $20 per ounce, to $1,335. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risk-on mood is also giving the US dollar a lift. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group writes: The US dollar rebounded at the open. The greenback gained against all of its G10 counterparts, except the Canadian dollar, as Hurricane Irma weakened after hitting Florida over the weekend. Greenpeace says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offshore wind auction is a historic moment for green energy Emma Pinchbeck of Renewable UK, a trade body, has also hailed the low price of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offshore wind farms: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early, but the renewable energy industry may be tempted to crack open the champagne. A new UK government auction has just shown that the price of producing offshore wind power has dropped dramatically, bolstering the case for investing in green energy rather than nuclear. Wind developers bid aggressively for the latest government subsidies in the auction, with the winning bidders committing to building new windfarms for as low as \u00c2\u00a357.50 per MWh. In comparison, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new nuclear power station at Hinkley point will cost \u00c2\u00a392.50 per MWh, and take two years longer to build. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: As well as a major boost for renewables in the UK, which have suffered from government subsidy cuts in recent years, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auction will fuel a debate over whether ministers should rethink their commitment to new nuclear power to meet the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon targets. The Green party said the results should sound the death knell for Hinkley Point C,which is currently being built by EDF in Somerset. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity markets are all comfortably higher this morning, as geopolitical worries ease. City investors are hoping that Hurricane Irma may not cause quite as much economic destruction as feared. Insurance company shares are rising in early trading. Bermuda-based Lancashire Holdings has jumped by 6.7%, while Beazley (which runs several syndicates at Lloyds of London) are up 5.7%. Before the storm hit Florida, insurance companies were bracing for bills of up to \u00c2\u00a3150bn. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: Investors are feeling somewhat relieved today after the most dire predictions in terms of a disaster caused by Hurricane Irma have evaporated. The damage caused by Hurricane Irma is still colossal as streets have been changed into rivers and nearly 3 million people are without any power. However, thankfully, the overall impact of Irma is falling short of prediction. It is important to keep in mind that the full damage picture will still be colossal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are rising this morning, on relief that last weekend passed without another provocation from North Korea. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has popped back over the 7,400 mark for the first time in a week, up 35 points in early trading. Other European equity indices are rising too, following a solid session of gains in Asia. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei jumped by almost 1.5%, with Hong Kong and South Korea close behind: Fears that North Korea would mark its 69th anniversary with another nuclear test proved unfounded ; instead Pyongyang restricted itself to more traditional celebrations. Associated Press explains: North Koreans observed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 69th founding anniversary with celebrations that included laying flowers and bowing at statues and portraits of past leaders. But Pyongyang did not carry out another test of its developmental intercontinental ballistic missile, as South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government had warned it might do. Attention now moves to the United Nations, where the United States has called for a vote later Monday on new sanctions. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have regained their risk appetite. There is a positive start to the new trading week after North Korea avoided further provocation during its Founding Day celebrations (despite US calls for a ban on selling it oil/gas, a clear attempt to get China to help more).... Also coming up today Insurance companies will be starting to count the cost of Hurricane Irma, as the mega storm continues to blast its way through Florida. Irma is currently heading for Tampa Bay, leaving more than three million US homes without power behind it. Experts fear that a storm surge at high tide could bring even more damage. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching disgraced PR firm Bell Pottinger, which could drop into administration this week following the scandal of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic apartheid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd campaign in South Africa.",

                "bodyText":"Right, time for a recap. The cost of living squeeze in Britain just became more uncomfortable, after inflation unexpectedly rose in August. The consumer prices index spiked to 2.9% in last month, from 2.6%, equalling May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-year high. Shoppers suffered a big jump in clothing prices, particularly for womenswear, plus pricier petrol at the pumps. Economists blamed the weak pound, which has made imports pricier. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, its highest level since 2011, putting more pressure on the Bank of England to consider an interest rate hike. Speculation that the BoE could raise borrowing costs sent the pound soaring. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently trading at a one-year high against the US dollar, at $1.327, and a six-week high against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.11. As this chat from the Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G shows, inflation is almost a whole percentage point over the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Unions have renewed their calls for the public sector pay cap to be abolished for all workers; otherwise staff such as nurses and teachers will continue to suffer a significant real wage cut. The jump in the pound pulled shares down in London (as it could hurt exporters). But other markets have continued to rally, sending global markets to their highest ever levels. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The markets remained dominated by the reaction to the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK inflation reading, with a bit of North Korea/Hurricane Irma relief thrown in for good measure. That relief has sent the MSCI All Country World Index to a new alltime high this afternoon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest inflation news story: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next budget will be delivered on 22nd November. This will be chancellor Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opportunity to announce new tax and spending plans, perhaps tear up the public sector pay cap, and try to guide the economy through the Brexit process. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting, though, that police and prison staff only make up 6% of the total public sector work force. Plus, the pay increases announced today are unfunded, so savings or cuts must be made elsewhere to pay for them. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another depressing, and informative, chart from the Resolution Foundation, showing how public sector workers have suffered falling real wages for much of the last decade. In the last hour, the government has announced that the 1% pay cap will be lifted for the police and prison workers. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get pay rises of 2% and 1% respectively -- still not enough to keep up with inflation. Trade unions have already warned that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough. Depressingly, the rise in UK inflation will fall particularly hard on poorer families. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because they spend a greater proportion of their income on food, clothes and housing, where prices have risen above average this year. Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted the details: Important media news: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take control of Sky has hit a potentially serious hurdle. Culture secretary Karen Bradley has just announced that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcminded\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to refer the bid to the competition authorities on the grounds of broadcasting standards (basically, whether Fox is a fit owner). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new development; Bradley is also planning to refer the bid on the grounds of media plurality. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by almost 3%, to their lowest level since Murdoch made his bid last December, as traders digest this new development. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures will be high on the agenda when the Bank of England meets later this week to set interest rates. Last month, the MPC voted 6-2 to leave borrowing costs unchanged, with the majority judging that the economy was too weak to justify a hike. On Thursday, the committee will be up to full strength of nine policymakers as new deputy governor Dave Ramsden joins the throng. So could policymakers decide \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenough is enough!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%? City experts are divided on this issue. Emanuele Canegrati of BlackPearlFX argues that the BoE should use the levers of monetary policy to get inflation down to its 2% target, and ease the cost of living squeeze. Ben Lord of M&amp;G predicts that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, will vote for a rate hike on Thursday, resulting in a 6-3 split but no rate rise. Lord believes that the Bank should sit tight, as inflation may peak soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Increased disagreement on the MPC will likely lead to some sterling strength, in the short term at least... But if we are a month or so away from peak inflation, to hike rates and strengthen the pound....would be overly myopic and pro-cyclical in my view. Kathleen Brooks of City Index points out that the City believes there is a greater chance of a rate rise before Christmas. The Overnight Index Swaps market has already rushed to price in a greater probability of a rate hike from the BOE by year end. The market now expects a 30% chance of a hike in December, this compares with 20% a week ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late for most British holidaymakers, but the pound is rallying against the euro this morning, as well as the dollar, Sterling has gained 1% against the European single currency to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.112, the highest level since the start of August. That means one euro is worth 89.9p, having hit 93p at the end of last month. We also have fresh evidence that the housing boom in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital is faltering. London house prices rose by just 2.8% in the 12 months to July 2017, much slower than the national average of 5.1%. Indeed, that makes the London the slowest region in England. London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00c2\u00a3489,000, followed by the South East, at \u00c2\u00a3321,000, and the East of England, at \u00c2\u00a3290,000 respectively. Public sector workers will see their real wages shrink by around 2% this year, unless the pay cap is dropped. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable says Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government needs to act urgently: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising inflation shows how urgent it is to address the sense of unfairness around the pay cap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With these numbers our nurses, teachers and other public sector workers will experience a 2% pay cut in the coming year. This will only aggravate the recruitment and retention crisis we are facing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must take urgent steps to lift the pay cap for all public sector workers, and increase wages in line with inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Sentance of PwC (and a former Bank of England interest-rate setter) fears that inflation will keep rising as the full impact of the weak pound ripples through the economy. He predicts that the consumer prices index will rise over 3% later this year, weakening growth. With very well-developed and complex supply chains, it can take a number of years for a decline in the exchange rate, which raises import prices, to feed through fully to consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This suggests that the recent squeeze on consumer spending from higher inflation will continue to dampen growth in the UK economy in the second half of this year and next year. There is not much sign yet that consumers will get any early relief from the surge in inflation following the Brexit vote last summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has now clawed back half of the losses suffered after the Brexit vote, but is still worth 10% less than in June 2016. Britain is now suffering its SECOND cost of living squeeze in a decade. As thus chart shows, inflation (in pink) outpaced wage growth once the financial crisis began in 2008. Real wages didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn positive until 2014, but have been shrinking since early 2017. The Treasury have sent a comment over, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal whether the public sector pay cap is being axed.... \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe know some families have concerns with their day to day cost of living. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we are boosting take home pay with tax cuts for over 30 million people and a National Living Wage that is giving the lowest earners their fastest pay rise for 20 years.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smashed expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is why the pound spiked to one-year high. He fears that it will hurt consumer spending in the coming months (which will be bad for growth). Berich adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The breadth of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation surprise is striking. All of the headline price indices, including Core CPI, PPI and RPI printed higher than median forecasts. The record 4.6% increase in clothing and footwear indicates that retailers are passing cost increases straight to consumers. On the whole, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures highlight just how hard inflation is continuing to bite into real wages, although it will be interesting to see how nominal wages perform in tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market data. As real wages fall, consumer spending is likely to come under further pressure this year, after a wobble in the first quarter. City economists are concerned to see that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inflation rate has hit a six-year high, at 2.7%. Core inflation strips out volatile factors like petrol and food, and is meant to give a better picture of economic pressures. Andreas Wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m of Nordea Markets predicts that this makes an early interest rate rise more likely. Economist Rupert Seggins agrees that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee will be concerned. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted a chart, showing how core inflation typically lags behind the exchange rate by about two years. If that relationship holds, the Brexit impact hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrived yet.... Edward Hardy, economist at currency firm WorldFirst, blames bad weather and geopolitical worries for driving inflation up. Hardy says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Petrol prices have come back to bite: after two months of stagnant energy costs, weather disruption in the Gulf of Mexico twinned with geopolitical tensions on the Korean peninsula have lit a fire under commodity prices . The recent recovery in the eurozone is also a factor. The euro hit an eight-year high against the pound in August, which makes imports from Europe more expensive. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has been driven up by the slump in the pound in the summer of 2016, after the Brexit vote. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK inflation may now be peaking. The public will hope he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, as wages are certainly not keeping pace with the cost of living. Brettell says: Inflation ticked up again in August, with increased petrol and diesel prices contributing to a year-on-year figure of 2.9%, up from 2.6% in July and matching May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-year high. This will inevitably raise questions about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing cost of living squeeze. Data released tomorrow is expected to show pay increasing at 2.2% in the three months to July, meaning wages are still shrinking in real terms. Yet it looks likely that inflation will fall back in the coming months, as the effect of Brexit-induced sterling weakness falls out of the year-on-year calculation. Trade unions say the UK government must now drop its pay cap on public sector workers, to give them more protection against inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost of living squeeze continues, with rising inflation outpacing wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to get a grip and get pay rising across the economy. A good start would be to scrap the pay cap for all public sector workers. There is speculation that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is preparing to lift the cap, for police officers and prison workers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough, though, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our dedicated public servants are a team. A pick and mix approach, that rewards some and not others, would be cynical and plain unfair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boom! The pound has hit a one-year high against the US dollar, following the spike in the cost of living. Sterling has gained a whole cent against the dollar to hit $1.3280, the strongest level since mid-September 2016. Traders are calculating that August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation surge means the Bank of England is more likely to raise interest rates soon. On an annual basis, clothing and footwear inflation in Britain has hit 4.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since the last days of the Thatcher administration, according to City economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon. Buying clothes became rather pricier last month.... Clothing and travel costs drove the cost of living up in August. Average clothing prices jumped by 2.4% between July and August 2017, with women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing becoming particularly pricier. Fuel costs also rose -- with petrol prices jumping by 1.8 pence per litre. Air fares rose as usual between July and August, by 10.9% (because it is peak holiday time...) This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) has risen sharply over the last year - back to levels seen in May this year, and in June 2013. BREAKING: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. That equals the four-year high struck in May this year. It means British households are still facing a cost of living squeeze, as wages are currently rising by around 2.1%. More to follow! The pound just hit a four-week against the euro, at 90.605p..... Economist Marc Br\u00c3\u00bctsch of Swiss Life predicts that UK inflation spiked to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. Royal Bank of Scotland predict that the Consumer Prices Index rose by 2.8%, but will spike over 3% this autumn. Just 15 minutes to wait.... Expectations that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate rose in August are pushing sterling higher this morning. The pound is up almost half a cent at $1.321 against the US dollar. A high inflation reading puts more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from the record lows (making it more lucrative to hold money in pounds). It says something about the financial markets that shares can rally on the back of a devastating storm that was only slightly less awful than feared. But what? Analysts at ING told clients this morning that investors are remarkably relaxed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether that equity reaction is Panglossian complacency or a sign of wonderful underlying fundamentals remains open to question. Even Category 5 storms can now be added to the list of things that \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Really Matter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If in doubt, blame the media..... European stock markets are pushing higher in early trading, as the momentum from Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally ripples back to the City. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders have regained their appetite for riskier assets. Investors are surely feeling less concerned about the potential hurricane damage cost. This has brought back the traditional risk on trade. The new (and watered down) sanctions on North Korea agreed by the United Nations last night are also boosting the markets today, says Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. World stock markets are at record highs this morning, thanks to relief that the economic cost of hurricane Irma will probably be lower than feared. Last night, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 index finished at its highest ever level, with insurance firms surging. Asian stocks have hit a 10-year high today, and European markets are also up in early trading. This has driven the MSCI All Country World Index - a broad measure of stocks around the globe - up to a new alltime peak of 484.12 points. Overnight, most powerful storm in Atlantic history has been downgraded to a tropical depression after causing terrible damage in the Caribbean, and in the Florida Keys region. The repair bill will run into many tens of billions, but is likely to miss the worst-case estimates - because Irma changed course and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strike a direct hit on the cities of Miama and Tampa. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief for the insurance industry, who were looking at a \u00c2\u00a3150bn bill for Irma at one stage. But traders should remember that 10 fatalities have been reported in the US, and another 37 in the Caribbean. Irma has still been a monster. US officials are warning of a possible humanitarian crisis unless power and water can be restored, and the clean-up job will be huge. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis will rear up again this morning, when new inflation figures are released. Economists predict that inflation jumped to around 2.8% per year in August, up from 2.6% in July. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the four-year high of 2.9% which the consumer prices index struck in May. If so, that would mean that the average Briton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real pay is falling. Earnings only rose by 2.1% in the three months to June (we get new figures tomorrow), meaning inflation is more than eroding any wage increases. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a particular blow for nurses, doctors and other public sector workers, thanks to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1% pay cap. The weak pound is driving inflation higher, by making imports more expensive. Higher fuel prices are also pushing the cost of living up, according to James Brown of consultancy firm Simon-Kucher: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For road users, petrol prices are up after the respite given by lower prices over the summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Driving to work cost 5% more in August and early September than last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Separate house price figures will show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing sector performed in July. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for the car industry too, as the Frankfurt Motor Show kicks off.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze has intensified, after wages again failed to keep pace with inflation. Average earnings only rose by 2.1% in May to July, meaning real wages actually shrank by 0.4%. Economists have warned that households are at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breaking point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and blamed the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote for making imports pricier. Low productivity, technological changes and the rise of the Gig economy are all also weighing on household incomes. The government, though, has hailed news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new 42-year low of 4.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because an extra 379,000 people joined the labour force in the last year. Employment minister Damian Hind says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strength of the economy is helping people of all ages find work, from someone starting their first job after leaving education, to those who might be starting a new career later in life. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment success is largely about a growth in full-time and permanent work, as employers invest in Britain and offer quality job opportunities that put more money into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there is more to do, and we will continue to build on our achievements through our employment programmes and the work of Jobcentre Plus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the surprisingly weak earnings figures has hit the pound, which has fallen back from a one-year high against the US dollar. City experts believe the poor wage figures will make it harder to raise interest rates, with one think tank estimating that workers are \u00c2\u00a3309 worse off than a year ago. The Bank of England meets tomorrow, and could be split 6-3 over whether to hold borrowing costs or raise them. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says the economy looks fragile: With consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real incomes falling, they are becoming more cautious and spending less. This is reflected in the increasing number of retailers with profit warnings or expressing cautious outlooks. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting! GW After a series of record highs, shares have dipped on Wall Street at the start of trading. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen 1%, following the unveiling of its latest products - including the iPhone X - last night. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment and wage figures: Anger in the streets if Athens boiled over this morning with police firing tear gas at protesting workers from the Canadian-owned Eldorado Gold mine company. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Police fired off rounds of tear gas at an estimated 100 workers protesting against potential job losses outside the energy ministry. Officers said they took the unexpected action after demonstrators attempted to storm the building shouting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave until workers permits are handed out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tensions have mounted since the Vancouver-based company threatened to pull out of Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u201c effectively dismantling the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest foreign investment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because of endless delays in procuring permits. George Burns, Eldorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, announced that operations would be halted on Monday only hours after prime minister Alexis Tsipras said his leftist-led government would do everything it could to welcome foreign investment. Under his personal stewardship, he said, a task-force dedicated to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grinvestment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would replace fears of Grexit. Around 2,000 people are employed by Eldorado which says its Skouries and Olympias projects in northern Greece have the potential to make Greece a leading European gold producer. Environmental concerns have prompted violent protests in what has become a test case of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve to attract foreign investors. And in the last few minutes, the government appears to have caved in and said it will be issuing licenses for Eldorado to press ahead with investments in northern Greece. The energy minister Giorgos Stathakis said necessary paperwork \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be concluded in the coming days, today and tomorrow. Three permits will be issues ... allowing Olympias to be fully operational.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bitcoin is having a bad day, following Jamie Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on the crypocurrency as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fraud\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will blow up. One Bitcoin now costs $3,830, down 8% today, and a fifth less than two weeks ago. Anyone who bought Bitcoin back in 2012, when it traded at just $11, is still sitting on a massive profit though. Other digital currencies are also falling sharply too: But some Bitcoin supporters appear to be shrugging off Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only useful for drug dealers, murderers and people living in North Korea. (OH = overheard) The Social Market Foundation thinktank has calculated that the average worker is \u00c2\u00a3309 per year worse off than a year ago, due to the drop in real wages. SMF chief economist Scott Corfe points out that private and public sector workers are suffering alike. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After adjusting for inflation, workers are significantly worse off than they were a year ago. In part this reflects the increase in the cost of living as a weak currency has pushed up the price of imported goods. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it also reflects weak earnings growth which remains stubbornly stuck in the doldrums. Improving productivity to boost pay is absolutely critical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With total pay growth lower in the private sector than the public sector in July, the government will be under more pressure to boost the pay of all workers in the economy. Lifting the public sector pay cap benefits less than a fifth of the workforce. Curiously, agriculture workers got a pay rise, even after inflation, in the last quarter. That could be a sign that farmers are having to pay more to attract and regain staff, now that Brexit and the fall in the pound has put off workers from the EU. Estate agents suffered one of the biggest drops in real income, though: The minister for employment, Damian Hinds, says we should celebrate Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in creating jobs - while conceding that things could be better. Hinds says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strength of the economy is helping people of all ages find work, from someone starting their first job after leaving education, to those who might be starting a new career later in life. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment success is largely about a growth in full-time and permanent work, as employers invest in Britain and offer quality job opportunities that put more money into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there is more to do, and we will continue to build on our achievements through our employment programmes and the work of Jobcentre Plus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Elsewhere, former chancellor Lord Alastair Darling has been reliving the Run on Northern Rock 10 years ago this week. My colleague Jill Treanor reports: The Resolution Foundation has held a conference \u00e2\u20ac\u0153between a rock and a hard place: 10 years on from the Northern Rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the chancellor of the time Alistair Darling and the new chair of the Treasury select committee Nicky Morgan. Darling has admitted that the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for several days this time 10 years ago when customers started queuing up around branches of the Newcastle-based lender. He also says the impact is being felt even now, arguing that: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Brexit would have happened if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been for the political and economic events of the preceding 10 years. people were disillusioned. they felt badly treated, they felt squeezed. The policies that were embarked upon by governments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c afterwards of austerity are also to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump would never have been elected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. And the continuation of electronic money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quantitative easing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is also a problem. It was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never intended to be the economic weapon of choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Morgan, in her first public appearance since being elected to chair the select committee, has said that when canvassing on doorsteps she felt the public wondered how money had been found to bailt out banks but not for other things. She had indicated that the select committee intends to take more evidence from the financial policy committee at the Bank of England \u00e2\u20ac\u201c set up to look for the next problem in the system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and champion the cause of consumers. Some small business customer she said were still avoiding dealing with banks because of the way they had been treated. Asked about whether bankers should be punished, Darling said that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to criminalise bad judgements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, says you can see a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market: The more competitive exchange rate has given a boost to manufacturing jobs, up 34,000 in the second quarter, but there are signs of weakness in the real estate sector where the number of jobs fell by 34,000. The consequences of the real wage squeeze for consumer spending may also be putting pressure on the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which shed 30,000 jobs in the quarter. This kind of mirror image effect could be an early pointer to a post Brexit future of winners and losers in the UK job market.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Also, of course, the plunge in the pound after the Brexit vote is the main reason inflation has risen sharply to 2.9%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector has shrunk to its smallest level since at least the start of the millennium. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report says: For June 2017, 16.9% of all people in work were employed in the public sector (the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999) and the remaining 83.1% worked in the private sector. This latest fall in real wages means that British workers still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recovered the earnings lost after the financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation has calculated that average earnings are \u00c2\u00a316 per week below their peak in 2007. That means workers are around \u00c2\u00a3830 per year worse off. Public sector workers have been hit harder, though, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthanks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1% pay cap: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, is also worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak productivity: The Bank of England predicts wage growth will rise to 3% next year, while inflation falls back towards the 2% target. The first part of that equation looks optimistic to me. The only sustainable driver of real wage growth is increasing productivity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in this respect the UK continues to lag behind its developed-world counterparts, notably the US and Germany. Unless a solution to this productivity puzzle is found, a meaningful improvement in living standards could be some way off. Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, can see the rise of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. He says: There have been particularly large gains in accommodation and food services (consistent with the boost to domestic tourism provided by the weak pound) and also in information and communication services. Employment in real estate activities and in professional, scientific and technical services has declined over the quarter. He also fears that UK wage growth will remain elusive: Indeed the rapid rise in employment suggests that productivity growth remains hard to come by, and this will continue to put limits on pay growth. The number of employees increased by 292,000 to 27.10 million over the last 12 months, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. But the number of self-employed people also rose, by 88,000 to 4.85 million. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm WorldFirst, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t celebrate the fall in the UK unemployment rate to a 42-year low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are more people in work than there have been for over 40 years, yet those people are only getting poorer due to wages that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep up with inflation. Pay increases are simply not coming for a multitude of reasons. Low productivity, Brexit fears over the future of individual sectors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade relationships and margins cut by higher import costs have all been referenced by companies large and small so far in 2017. This is now the nature of the UK business landscape: multi-decade lows in joblessness are not something to celebrated. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak wage growth is leaving consumers struggling to cope, warns Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Monk calls today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bitter pill to swallow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK CPI figures showed that inflation had jumped to 2.9% which means that wages are falling further behind the price we pay for goods and services. As a result UK households will continue to have their finances stretched to breaking point. Fidelity also sent over this chart, showing how wages (in red) are failing to keep pace with inflation (blue). So, Monk expect the Bank of England to leave interest rates at their record lows of just 0.25%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lagging wages makes it more likely the Bank of England will look through rising inflation when it decides on interest rates this week. Prices are rising above target, which creates the case for raising rates, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage data suggests all is still not right in the economy. Ouch! The pound has fallen back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-year high, following the disappointing wage growth figures. Sterling is back below $1.33; traders are concluding that the cost of living squeeze will deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the BoW won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd consumers, adding: The UK wage growth data was as bad as it can get. At 4.3%, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been this low since March to May 1975, when Harold Wilson was prime minister: But this recovery simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delivering solid pay gains. Instead, wage growth was stubbornly unmoved at 2.1%, both including and excluding bonuses. Here are more details from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report: There were 32.14 million people in work, 181,000 more than for February to April 2017 and 379,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 75.3%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.46 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 75,000 fewer than for February to April 2017 and 175,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to a new 42-year low of 4.3%, in the three months to July. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 4.4% a month ago, and the lowest since 1975. But real wages are still falling. Average weekly earnings only rose by 2.1% per year in the quarter, weaker than expected, and the same as last month. That means that the cost of living squeeze is getting worse, as inflation has jumped from 2.6% to 2.9%. More to follow! The boss of JP Morgan has weighed in on the cryptocurrency debate, declaring that Bitcoin is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a fraud\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will end in tears. Jamie Dimon told a banking conference in the US that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d fire any staff caught trading Bitcoin, arguing that: The currency isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to work. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea or a bunch of parts like that, or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars. So there may be a market for that, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be a limited market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A decade after the run on Northern Rock, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector is unprepared to handle another crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a new report by the Adam Smith Institute, the right-wing thinktank, which argues that the Bank of England is failing to police the banks properly. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some good charts to get us up to speed, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report. They shows how real wages (adjusted for inflation) have been falling for several months, even as the unemployment rate hits its lowest since the 1970s. The strength of the pound is pulling shares down in London this morning. The FTSE 100 has shed 58 points, or 0.8%, to 7354. Mining giants, oil companies and major exporters, such as pharmaceutical group Shire and drinks firm Diageo, are among the fallers. A stronger currency means their overseas earnings are worth less in sterling terms. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The miners have all moved lower, while BP and Shell are both down half a percent. However, the main reason for the UK index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline was the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest climb. The British pound has seen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous strength this week\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets, adding: If you want to see a currency which is having one of the best runs this week, then look no further. Sterling has also risen against the euro, gaining 0.2% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1124. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has hit a new one-year high this morning, as the City braces for a new health-check on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market. Sterling has risen to $1.332 against the dollar, the highest level in exactly a year. That means it has clawed back around half its losses after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally follows yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected jump in inflation to 2.9%, which is fuelling expectations that interest rates could rise sooner than previously thought. But... is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy really strong enough to handle a rate rise? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a clue at 9.30am when the latest labour market statistics are released. The City expects that the UK economy continued to create jobs in the last quarter, leaving the unemployment rate at just 4.4%, its lowest in over 40 years. But this jobs recovery hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been feeding through to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, are expected to have risen by 2.2% per year in the three months to July. That would be an improvement on last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, but well below inflation. As Royal Bank of Canada put it: For average earnings the story continues to be disappointing. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why most economists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates until 2018. But...the BoE meets to set interest rates tomorrow, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatter in the City that chief economist Andy Haldane could become the third policymaker to vote for a hike. Michael Hewson of CMC Capital Markets explains: A solid wages number could shift the calculus on the MPC further towards a rate rise with chief economist Andrew Haldane likely to join the other two hawks Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty in pushing for a rate rise, given recent comments he made during the summer, when inflation ticked up to the same level it is now. Also coming up... City traders will also be remembering the events of 10 years ago, when Northern Rock was forced to seek help from the Bank of England - triggering the first UK bank run in over a century. The Resolution Foundation is holding an events in London with former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling this morning, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an ear out. European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, with the FTSE 100 being called down around 18 points or 0.25%. We also get new eurozone unemployment and factory output statistics.

But things have started to turn round, with the latest annualised growth numbers showing the eurozone growing at 2.3% compared with 2.2% for the US. Structural reforms, painful and slow as they may have been, are finally beginning to bear fruit. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy holding up Despite fears of a slowdown in China, which would have a dramatic knock-on effect on world growth, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appears to be holding up. Granted, a number of indicators including industrial production and retail sales proved disappointing in August and below the previous month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level. But analysts suggest the figures show that China was still growing at an annualised rate of about 5%, and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency remains strong.",

Down 0.26% earlier, sterling has now fallen 0.54% against the dollar to $1.3518. Against the euro the pound is down 0.65% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1302. Carney said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, and to be consistent with monetary policy continuing to provide substantial support to the economy. </p> <p>There remain considerable risks to the UK outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to these developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. </p> </blockquote> <p>On Brexit, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Carney, making a speech at the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Washington, said the process of globalisation that has led to deeper integration in the world economy in recent decades had pushed down price growth.</p> <p>But Brexit represented the opposite for Britain, at least in the short term, as less openness to foreign markets and workers was likely to push up inflation and reduce productivity, he said.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153On balance, the de-integration effects of Brexit can be expected to ... be inflationary,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At present, the main question concerns the extent to which this adjustment has been brought forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>...In his speech on Monday, Carney also said Britain was unlikely to immediately offset any weakening of trade ties with its EU partners by striking new trade agreements with other countries.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153But Brexit is an example of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreculer pour mieux sauter,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said, using a French expression which means stepping back in order to jump better</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T15:13:48.647Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59bfdf34e4b08e19a9efc1cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T15:00:06.592Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney is set to give the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, and it can be <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Events/2017-michel-camdessus-central-banking-lecture\">viewed live here</a> now.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bfd90be4b07c06ffc86289\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T14:33:13.021Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets continue to fly higher:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/909778440458469376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MondayMotivation?src=hash\">#MondayMotivation</a><br>S&amp;P: All-Time High<br>Dow: All-Time High<br>Nasdaq: All-Time High<br>NYSE: All-Time High<br>Global Dow: All-Time High <a href=\"https://t.co/ynBGMwMtTj\">pic.twitter.com/ynBGMwMtTj</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/909778440458469376\">September 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bfd544e4b07c06ffc86276\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T14:20:01.064Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has slipped back against the dollar after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rises in the wake of suggestions of a UK interest rate rise in November.</p> <p>Part of this is due to an uptick in the dollar ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Federal Reserve meeting, and part to new concerns over Brexit. Sterling is currently 0.26% lower at $1.3556. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has moved lower against its peers ...following its surge on Friday. The pound remained strong over the weekend, still buoyed by investor anticipation of an interest rate rise later this year, but has cooled off as traders turn their attention to Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Europe, this Friday. Despite slipping against the dollar this morning, sterling is still much stronger than the weak levels seen in recent weeks.</p> <p>The pound may have also been weighed down slightly by the renewed political controversy over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBritain will have \u00c2\u00a3350m a week more to spend outside the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claim from Foreign secretary Boris Johnson over the weekend. In the months since the election, political disunity has made traders cautious, therefore any suggestion of dissent within the government could slow the gains the pound could make off of the prospect of a rate rise.

As you can see, it has more than doubled since 2009, when the financial crisis triggered a global recession.</p> <p>So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind the recovery, and can it last? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few thoughts</p> <p><strong>1) Easy Money. </strong>Central banks fired up their electronic money printing presses when the crisis broke, creating hundreds of billions of new euros, dollars and pounds to buy assets and support the economy. The idea was to make encourage commercial banks to lend, and buy riskier assets, but these asset purchase schemes ended up driving bond and share prices to record levels.</p> <p>The European Central Bank (which started later) is still expanding its balance sheet, while the Bank of England isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close to unwinding QE.</p> <p>America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve is further along the path to ending easy money, having started raising interest rates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting is so important, as it will signal how quickly or slowly it will proceed along this path.</p> <p><strong>Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, </strong>head of investment at<strong> Interactive Investor,</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks have underpinned equity market valuations since the financial crisis, with excess liquidity and low interest rates both providing the stimulus and the foundations for higher valuations.</p> <p>What global central banks and in particular the Federal Reserve does next is therefore hugely important for investors. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) Eurozone crisis fades from memory</strong>. Although Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still struggling, the prospect of European monetary union fracturing has receded over the last two years. </p> <p>S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to upgrade Portugal back to investment grade highlights how the eurozone economy, if not exactly booming, is looking much healthier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/909687403589324800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PORTUGUESE BOND YIELDS SET FOR BIGGEST DAILY FALL SINCE FEB 2016, DOWN 22 BASIS POINTS <a href=\"https://t.co/qVasgEegIA\">pic.twitter.com/qVasgEegIA</a></p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaOne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/909687403589324800\">September 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>3) China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered a hard landing (yet). </strong>Economists have been warning for years that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is riddled with bad debt, and that its shadow banking sector is going to implode. Beijing, though, seems to be succeeding in curbing the worst excesses <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-gdp-grows-6-9-in-q2-beats-expectations/articleshow/59625960.cms\">without hurting growth</a>. </p> <p><strong>4) Global economy is still growing. </strong>Despite shocks such as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, and the Brexit vote, the world economy is still managing steady if unspectacular growth.</p> <p>The IMF predicts that global gross domestic product would rise by 3.5% this year, and by 3.6%. That should support corporate profits, and thus share prices (which ought to reflect a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings potential).</p> <p><strong>5) Geopolitical worries recede.</strong> Markets have notoriously short memories, so the recent dialling down of rhetoric between North Korea and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@RealDonaldTrump</a> is also helping to nudge shares higher. </p> <p>Yesterday. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said American hopes that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peaceful pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd campaign will succeed in denuclearizing North Korea. That sort of diplomatic jaw-jaw tends to reassure investors....</p> <p>So, 10 years after the financial crisis, what should we worry about?</p> <p><strong>BIS, the organisation for central bankers, gave us a clue last night</strong>. It warned that global growth could stumble once interest rates start to rise.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets have begun the week on a positive note, as investors shrugged off any lingering worries about geopolitical tensions and central bank actions. They seemed reassured that there were no further developments in the North Korea situation over the weekend, presumably on the basis that no news is good news. And despite the recent hints from the Bank of England that a UK rate rise could come as soon as November, new comments from Bank governor Mark Carney that any increases were likely to be gradual and limited saw the pound come of its recent highs. This in turn helped lift the FTSE 100, given that a weaker pound benefits exporters. European markets were also caught up in the optimism, while on on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hit new record highs ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 37.81 points or 0.52% at 7253.28 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,559.39 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.3% to 5229.32 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,364.74 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 10,338.4 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.99% to 760.79 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.34% at 22,344 having earlier hit a new peak of 22,355. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A sharp fall in migrant workers coming to Britain as a consequence of Brexit could push up wages and cause a spike in inflation in the short term, according to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, writes my colleague Richard Partington. Setting out his view on inflation days after the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate setting panel indicated it could raise the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade, the governor said the rapid deceleration of migrant labour could lead to shortages for employers, pushing up wage growth and inflation in the short term. However, in the long-term, higher levels of immigration do not have an impact on wages or inflation, he said. In a speech in Washington, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the longer-term, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit could therefore ultimately have only a modest impact on prices in general equilibrium.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney also warned that a fall in immigration in the wake of Brexit could push up wages and inflation: Abrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures. In addition, the ease with which UK employers have been able to source labour from abroad and move operations offshore as a result of globalisation may have weighed on wage growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though the size of such contestability effects is difficult to judge. Brexit is likely to push up inflation, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said, as he repeated his view that interest rates were likely to rise in the coming months. But in his 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington, he suggested rises would be limited, and he warned of risks to the UK economy. These comments have seen the pound slip back further against the dollar. Down 0.26% earlier, sterling has now fallen 0.54% against the dollar to $1.3518. Against the euro the pound is down 0.65% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1302. Carney said: Any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, and to be consistent with monetary policy continuing to provide substantial support to the economy. There remain considerable risks to the UK outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to these developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. On Brexit, Reuters reports: Carney, making a speech at the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Washington, said the process of globalisation that has led to deeper integration in the world economy in recent decades had pushed down price growth. But Brexit represented the opposite for Britain, at least in the short term, as less openness to foreign markets and workers was likely to push up inflation and reduce productivity, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On balance, the de-integration effects of Brexit can be expected to ... be inflationary,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At present, the main question concerns the extent to which this adjustment has been brought forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ...In his speech on Monday, Carney also said Britain was unlikely to immediately offset any weakening of trade ties with its EU partners by striking new trade agreements with other countries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But Brexit is an example of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreculer pour mieux sauter,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said, using a French expression which means stepping back in order to jump better Bank of England governor Mark Carney is set to give the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, and it can be viewed live here now. US markets continue to fly higher: The pound has slipped back against the dollar after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rises in the wake of suggestions of a UK interest rate rise in November. Part of this is due to an uptick in the dollar ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Federal Reserve meeting, and part to new concerns over Brexit. Sterling is currently 0.26% lower at $1.3556. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said: The pound has moved lower against its peers ...following its surge on Friday. The pound remained strong over the weekend, still buoyed by investor anticipation of an interest rate rise later this year, but has cooled off as traders turn their attention to Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Europe, this Friday. Despite slipping against the dollar this morning, sterling is still much stronger than the weak levels seen in recent weeks. The pound may have also been weighed down slightly by the renewed political controversy over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBritain will have \u00c2\u00a3350m a week more to spend outside the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claim from Foreign secretary Boris Johnson over the weekend. In the months since the election, political disunity has made traders cautious, therefore any suggestion of dissent within the government could slow the gains the pound could make off of the prospect of a rate rise. With the Prime Minister in Canada to discuss trade deals, analysts will be looking at more political drivers for the pound this week, in addition to data releases. With investors turning their attention to supposedly riskier assets such as shares, there have been some falls among the traditional havens. Gold fell to a two and a half week low of $1311 an ounce while among equities, there are also falls in defensive stocks like tobacco - Imperial Brands is down 2% - and water companies. Records are indeed being broken on Wall Street in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to a new peak of 22,332, up more than 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.13% to a new high of 2,503. Easing tensions over North Korea are playing a part, while investors are awaiting the latest Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. European markets are holding on to their gains ahead of Wall Street opening shortly. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.25% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.16%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 40 points higher. Over in Washington, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is promising a new crackdown on corruption. Channelling Captain Renault in Casablanca, Lagarde is telling a Brookings Institution event that no-one should be shocked to learn that some public officials accept bribes, and that some companies are keen to offer them. Citing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Panama Papers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd revelations, Lagarde says the IMF can and will do more to tackle corruption. She warns: As we assist our members in fighting public corruption, we also are committed to looking at transnational private actors who influence public officials. Private actors may help generate corruption through direct means such as bribery, but they also can facilitate corruption through indirect means, such as money laundering and tax evasion. The recent example of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Panama Papers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd highlights the importance of these facilitators, and underscores the pernicious way corruption can quietly spread across borders. Increased transparency and accountability can help reduce corruption, Lagarde, adds, along with strengthening legal institutions to tackle wrongdoers.... The oddest story of the day is that tens of thousands of euros have been found the toilet at a Geneva branch of UBS. The discovery, a few months ago, has baffled Swiss prosecutors - especially as more euros were discovered clogging the pipes of near by restaurants too. Bloomberg has more details. The stock markets are increasingly being driven by greed this week, says CNN: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on a series of metrics, including market volatility and demand for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput options\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (a right to sell at a certain price, which would be profitable if shares fell). The US stock market is expected to hit new highs when trading begins in two hours time. The S&amp;P 500 index is called up 0.2%, extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, as anxiety over conflict in the Korean peninsula abates. Charalambos Pissouros, senior analyst at IronFX, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153....as long as the situation does not escalate into military conflict, market participants may continue to place less and less emphasis on North Korean developments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A reminder of how the markets have rallied strongly over the last 18 months..... British arms manufacturer BAE has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this morning, after announcing a big sale to Qatar. BAE is selling 24 Eurofighter Typhoons to Qatar, in a deal which analysts reckon is worth over \u00c2\u00a31bn. Defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon says its a significant move: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an important moment in our defence relationship and the basis for even closer defence co-operation between our two countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an important moment in Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with its neighbours. Three months ago, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt all cut off diplomatic relations, accusing Doha of promoting terrorism. These Middle Eastern tensions could be good for business, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Last month, Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction buy list, citing Saudi Arabian contracts as the reason behind the move, and now they are selling to Qatar too. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the MSCI All Country World Index hit a new record high this morning. The ACWI tracks 2,400 stocks in 47 countries, so gives a gauge of equity valuations around the globe. As you can see, it has more than doubled since 2009, when the financial crisis triggered a global recession. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind the recovery, and can it last? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few thoughts 1) Easy Money. Central banks fired up their electronic money printing presses when the crisis broke, creating hundreds of billions of new euros, dollars and pounds to buy assets and support the economy. The idea was to make encourage commercial banks to lend, and buy riskier assets, but these asset purchase schemes ended up driving bond and share prices to record levels. The European Central Bank (which started later) is still expanding its balance sheet, while the Bank of England isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close to unwinding QE. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve is further along the path to ending easy money, having started raising interest rates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting is so important, as it will signal how quickly or slowly it will proceed along this path. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks have underpinned equity market valuations since the financial crisis, with excess liquidity and low interest rates both providing the stimulus and the foundations for higher valuations. What global central banks and in particular the Federal Reserve does next is therefore hugely important for investors. 2) Eurozone crisis fades from memory. Although Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still struggling, the prospect of European monetary union fracturing has receded over the last two years. S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to upgrade Portugal back to investment grade highlights how the eurozone economy, if not exactly booming, is looking much healthier. 3) China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered a hard landing (yet). Economists have been warning for years that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is riddled with bad debt, and that its shadow banking sector is going to implode. Beijing, though, seems to be succeeding in curbing the worst excesses without hurting growth. 4) Global economy is still growing. Despite shocks such as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, and the Brexit vote, the world economy is still managing steady if unspectacular growth. The IMF predicts that global gross domestic product would rise by 3.5% this year, and by 3.6%. That should support corporate profits, and thus share prices (which ought to reflect a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings potential). 5) Geopolitical worries recede. Markets have notoriously short memories, so the recent dialling down of rhetoric between North Korea and @RealDonaldTrump is also helping to nudge shares higher. Yesterday. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said American hopes that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peaceful pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd campaign will succeed in denuclearizing North Korea. That sort of diplomatic jaw-jaw tends to reassure investors.... So, 10 years after the financial crisis, what should we worry about? BIS, the organisation for central bankers, gave us a clue last night. It warned that global growth could stumble once interest rates start to rise. This is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunch bowl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worry - that the markets are intoxicated on cheap credit, and will slump onto the carpet when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken away. BIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Claudio Borio fears that the world could be caught in a debt trap, saying: Debt service ratios are only so low because interest rates have been falling so much. There is a certain circularity in all this that points to the risk of a debt trap: the protracted decline in interest rates to unusually low levels, regardless of the strength of the underlying economy, creates the conditions that complicate their subsequent return to more normal levels. Just in: Prices across the eurozone rose by 1.5% per year last month, up from 1.3% in July, stats body Eurostat says. That confirms the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reading from two weeks ago, and means inflation is still below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of close to, but below, 2%. Energy prices rose by 4%, while services costs picked by by 1.6% and food prices gained 1.4%. That ripping noise you can hear is HSBC tearing up its sterling forecasts. The bank has ditched its forecast that the pound would have hit $1.20 by the end of 2017, and languished there through 2018. Now it believes sterling will cling onto today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.35, and only slide slightly next year. Quite a change, triggered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signals from the Bank of England that interest rates could rise in November. Meanwhile, the pound is slipping back from Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-year high. Sterling is down almost half a cent at $1.354, having surged last week when the Bank of England dropped several clanging hints that interest rates are going up soon. Traders are looking to prime minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming Europe speech on Friday, for signs that the UK is heading towards a hard or soft Brexit. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also watching the unfolding row between Boris Johnson and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics offices, after the foreign secretary reheated the idea that Britain will have \u00c2\u00a3350m to spend on the NHS every week after Brexit. The markets are also benefitting from optimism that Portugal is putting the eurozone debt crisis behind it. Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond prices have hit a one-year high this morning, after credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upgraded the country back to investment grade. Lisbon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has surged by 1.8%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is also clawing back some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses (triggered by the stronger pound). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 31 points at 7246, having hit a five-month low on Friday. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having been battered in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling super surge, the FTSE is using a quiet Monday morning to claw back some of its losses. Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are the biggest fallers, down around 1%, as traders move into riskier assets. European stock markets have joined the rally, sending the Stoxx 600 index up to a six-week high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that investors are focused on Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. Upbeat U.S. inflation data was not enough to move markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of an interest rate hike in December. The odds for an interest rate hike by the end of year stands at 56%, according to CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FedWatch; whether this is about to change on Wednesday, relies on the Fed dot plot and Chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit a new alltime high this morning, as traders regain their appetite for risky assets. The City is relieved that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen any fresh missile tests from North Korea in recent days, taking the risk of nuclear war off traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds. Investors are also preparing for a crucial US central bank meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and give more guidance on how it will unwind its massive bond-purchase programme. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says some Fed policymakers, such as Lael Brainard, may signal that US interest rates will only rise modestly. Markets anticipate that the Fed will keep rates unchanged (with a December rate hike now seen as 50/50), but announce that it will commence balance sheet reduction at a pace of $10bn per month in Q4. The statement will doubtless keep the option of a December rate hike clearly on the table, but markets will as ever hone in on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with many expecting the likes of Brainard to perhaps adjust their trajectory lower Anything that keep the era of easy money alive is good for share prices. So, the MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All Country World Index has nudged a new peak of 485.82 this morning, as traders pile back into equities. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons the markets may be getting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdesensitised\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the North Korean issue. Short of shots being fired, these tensions are likely to have fairly short term and short lived effects, which helps explain the positive start to the week for Asia shares this morning which in turn is likely to lead to a positive start to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European trading session. Indeed, stock markets in Asia are at their highest level in a decade today. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi closed at a six-week high, led by tech shares, and Thailand is also rallying. European stock markets are following suit, gaining around 0.5% at the start of trading: Traders will also we watching out for updated eurozone inflation figures, and a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this afternoon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 10am BST: The final eurozone inflation reading for August. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to confirm that prices rose by 1.5% last month, up from 1.3% in July, but still below the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just below 2%. 4pm BST: Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivers the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington DC. Investors will be looking for any fresh clues about future UK interest rate rises, but Carney may address an issue with more global appeal....",

                "bodyText":"World markets are continuing their record runs, unperturbed by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric against North Korea at the UN and despite some caution ahead of the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday. The MSCI All Country World Index, a broad measure of global shares, reached a new peak of 487.48, while the Nikkei closed just under 2% higher. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both hit new peaks, while European shares managed to edge higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 21.97 points or 0.3% higher at 7275.25 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.02% to 12,561.79 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.16% to 5237.44 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.27% to 22,425.42 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.39% at 10,378.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.27% to 762.86 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.2% at 22,378, and on track for yet another record close. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The pound has had an uncertain day. Initially sterling slipped back in the wake of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Monday that any rate rises would be gradual and limited. But a report that Boris Johnson could resign as foreign secretary before the weekend if his demands over Brexit were not met - although denied - saw the pound jump half a cent to $1.3535. But as the day progressed the currency drifted back from its best levels and is currently up just 0.01% at $1.3495. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to the UN had a few hair raising moments, including the threat that the US might have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally destroy North Korea.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But markets seem to be fairly unmoved by this and all of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other state of the world comments. Wall Street is off its best levels but still up around 16 points and close to its all time highs. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Wall Street opened this morning at a record high and, despite a few concerns over the contents of his speech, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maiden address to the United Nations hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upset the applecart too much. While the President continued his hard-line stance on North Korea, the threat of war seems less likely than it did a couple of weeks ago. More importantly for traders, Trump again reiterated his desire to again put America first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c continuing the run of confidence in the US market. The next big milestone for traders is the Fed meeting tomorrow to discuss raising interest rates. While a hike doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem on the cards until December, any indication that that might be brought forward could see the bullishness of the markets quickly shaken off. The outlook for global growth is positive, says ratings agency Fitch, but this could be tempered by the withdrawal of central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stimulus measure. In its latest global credit outlook report, Fitch says: Global rating outlooks remain on an improving trend and are on balance less negative that at the start of the year across most rating sectors.... However the improving outlook for global credit quality is underpinned by years of loose central bank monetary policy, including quantitative easing, as well as what are now the strongest world growth conditions since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead in the rating cycle, the most benign credit market conditions in modern history will gradually begin to normalise as central bank assistance is withdrawn and world growth peaks in 2018. This could begin to temper the otherwise upbeat rating outlook trend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Monica Insoll, managing director in Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit market research team. Unwinding QE will pose challenges to both borrowers and lenders, including the many sovereigns with post-2000 high government debt-to-GDP levels. With a number of markets appearing to be approaching cyclical peaks, it may also expose potential asset bubbles, including those in buoyant housing markets such as Australia, Canada and some Nordic countries. The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates and at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, it is expected to set out plans to unwind its balance sheet and begin selling bonds bought as part of QE. The European Central Bank is also likely to set out plans to move away from QE before too long, while the Bank of England has recently been hinting at the prospect of a rate rise as early as November. Ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision from the US Federal Reserve on interest rates and the future of its monetary policy, Wall Street has opened at yet new heights. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.15% at a record 22,366 while the S&amp;P has edged up 0.12% to a new high. Apart from the Fed meeting, the other main event exercising investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds is President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at the United Nations. Some disappointing data from the US, just as the Federal Reserve deliberates on interest rates and monetary policy. The current account deficit - the difference between goods and services flowing into and out of the country - rose from $113.5bn in the first quarter to $123.1bn in the second three months of the year compared to expectations of a figure of $115.1bn. The first quarter figure was revised down from $116.8bn. Import prices jumped by 0.6% in August, up from 0.1% in the previous month, as the cost of petrol jumped and the dollar weakened. And housing starts fell for the second month in a row, down 0.8% in August. Following the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reports on the debt time bomb, with huge borrowings being racked up by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most vulnerable consumers, there are calls for an independent inquiry. Phillip Inman and Jill Treanor write: The chairs of two powerful parliamentary committees have urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the \u00c2\u00a3200bn of credit amassed by households, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis raises alarm among senior MPs. The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Debt is a huge emotional burden for people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unstable personal finances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough. The \u00c2\u00a3200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same levels it reached before the 2008 financial crisis and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that interest rates were likely to rise in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages. Their full report is here: And here are more reports in our series: Sterling has edged higher following a report that Boris Johnson might resign by the weekend if the prime minister does not change her Brexit stance. It is now up 0.25% at $1.3526, after an initial dip. The Foreign Office has no immediate comment on the Telegraph story, and Johnson told the paper he will not resign. But the ripple in the market shows investors are nervous about the whole Brexit situation. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB, said: The rise in sterling since the news is modest compared to recent rallies but it shows nonetheless that the markets are closely watching the latest political developments with a keen eye. Recently economic data and monetary policy have usurped politics in driving the pound, but the latest news is a timely reminder that the political situation can quickly become front and centre once more after what has been, since the Brexit vote at least, a relatively prolonged period on the back-burner. European stock markets are hovering around six-week highs today, as the City awaits tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up around 0.2%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is down a smidgen. City economists are still expecting the Fed to leave US interest rates on hold, perhaps until December. The Fed will also probably outline how it will unwind its huge bond-buying programme. Jack Flaherty, investment director at asset manager GAM explains: The Fed finally looks set to announce the normalisation of its balance sheet and we think the necessary reinvestment tapering will begin in October. It is not likely to change its growth and employment forecasts significantly, though with inflation on the low side of expectations, some of the base line numbers may be adjusted downwards. A rate hike is still on the cards for this year, unless inflation comes in even further below target. I missed this earlier, but German investor confidence has bounced back in August. The ZEW Institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly barometer of financial morale jumped to 17 this month, up from 10 back in August, and much higher than expected. ZEW president Achim Wambach credited: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Solid growth in the second quarter, recent big increases in banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lending business and growing investment from firms and the state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The survey also shows that German investors are concerned about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects: In other news, a new survey has shown that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders cracked on in July. Construction sector production in the EU rose by 0.5% per month in July, and by 0.2% in the eurozone, Eurostat reports. It was driven by an increase in building production (such as building new houses), while civil engineering output dropped. That suggests that construction will provide a positive impact on European growth over the summer, says Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macro. Over the last year, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction output has risen by 3.6%. Britain, though, is lagging behind, as the uncertainty created by Brexit weighs on the economy. Eurostat says: Among Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in production in construction were recorded in Hungary (+22.6%), Sweden (+21.2%), Poland (+19.8%) and Slovakia (+14.7%). Decreases were observed in the United Kingdom (-1.1%) and Italy (-0.4%). Zero-hours contracts are a particular issue for young workers. One third of people on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are aged 16 to 24, compared with 11.4% for all people in employment. Dr Carole Easton OBE, chief executive of the Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust, says this creates insecurity and financial problems for young people, leading to anxiety and mental health issues. Dr Easton explains: Budgeting, paying your bills and planning ahead can be impossible when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how many hours you will be working or how much money you will have coming in each month. For some, an inability to balance precarious shifts with childcare can make working impossible. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard Partington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: The storm of controversy over zero-hours contracts in recent years has forced some employers to ditch them. Instead, people are being hired on contracts that only guarantee a small number of hours each week - which can then be increased as needed. Alan Price, employment law director at Peninsula (a HR and employment law firm), explains: Zero hours contracts have received mass negative publicity regarding their use and the unfair treatment of staff working under these contracts. Large companies, such as McDonalds, have been seeking a move away from these contracts by giving staff the opportunity to request a contract with guaranteed hours, calculated as an average of the hours worked under their previous zero hours contracts. It is likely many other companies are recruiting on similar contracts containing a small number of guaranteed hours and then requesting staff to work extra hours as and when to meet business demands. Moving away from the name \u00e2\u20ac\u02dczero hours contracts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 removes the negative connotations associated with these contracts and improves public perception of the company. It can also make recruitment easier by defining available positions as flexible and guaranteed hours, rather than zero hours. On average, someone on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours contract\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd usually works 26 hours a week, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also more likely to be female. The ONS says: People on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are more likely to be young, part-time, women or in full-time education when compared with other people in employment. The TUC have welcomed the drop in zero-hours contracts, but also wants more action. General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u01531.4 million zero-hour contracts is 1.4 million too many. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good that some employers have ditched them as a result of union campaigning, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretend that life at the sharp end has become easier overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One in ten UK workers remain in insecure jobs. The spread of low-paid self-employment, agency work and short-hours contracts mean millions are struggling to get by The Labour Party says the drop in zero-hours contracts isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough - it wants them banned altogether. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, says all workers deserve to have guaranteed hours: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a national scandal that there are 1.4 million contracts that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee minimum hours, with people stuck in limbo in insecure work, not knowing how much they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll earn from week to week, unable to budget for basic necessities and unsure if they can even pay the rent. The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the broken labour market which is rigged against workers and adopt Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to ban zero hour contracts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows how the number of people on zero-hours contracts appears to have peaked.... ..this chart shows that administration, food, accommodation and healthcare companies use them the most... ..and crucially, this charts shows that people on zero-hours contracts are more likely to want more work than other workers. The number of people on zero hours contracts has fallen to its lowest level since 2014, suggesting demand for these contracts may have peaked. A new report from the Office for National Statistics shows that there were 1.4 million contracts which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee any actual work, down from 1.7m a year earlier. In addition, the number of people working these contracts fell to 883,000 in the three months to June, a drop of 20,000 (as we reported last month). This could be a significant moment, following criticism of the way that some companies use zero-hours contracts. Senior ONS statistician David Freeman says: In May this year there were 1.4m employment contracts in use that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guarantee minimum hours, down from a peak of 2.1m two years previously. Coupled with figures we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen from the Labour Force Survey showing a small fall in the number of people who say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on zero-hours contracts, it seems possible that the trend towards this type of work has begun to unwind. More to follow.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dark morning for Toys R Us. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest toy retailer has been forced to seek bankruptcy protection this morning, in an attempt to tackle its $5bn debt mountain. Analysts are blaming the move towards online shopping and electronic gadgets, which means fewer families trek to their local toy store for a new board game, ball or bike. Back in the 90s, every child with a working TV would regularly be told about the delights of Toys R US; a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153magical place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with millions of toys all under one roof. Happy memories.... There are plenty of issues for investors to watch closely this week, from interest rate decisions to Hurricane Maria as it heads towards the British Virgin Islands. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, explains: With President Trump expected to talk tough on North Korea and Iran during his first U.N. speech today, investors will be keeping a close eye on any repercussions further out. That we also have two Central Bank meetings [in America and Japan] and the all-important Brexit speech from Theresa May to come this week, means economic data is likely to be less pressing for investors. There are mixed feelings over the FOMC meeting too, despite high expectations of balance sheet reduction. Investors are aware that Trump has the potential to change the make-up of the Fed over the coming months, which could potentially pour cold water on any plans unveiled this week. So investors are likely bracing themselves for potential political risk around a central bank which is meant to be politically independent. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accountancy watchdog has ended its probe into KPMG over its auditing of HBOS, the bank which failed during the financial crisis almost a decade ago. The Financial Reporting Council has concluded there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a realistic prospect that a Tribunal would make an Adverse Finding against KPMG. KPMG had been criticised for signing off HBOS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts in early 2008, just eight months before the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds. Subsequently, HBOS was heavily criticised for its reckless lending policies, which led to billions of toxic loans which sank the bank when the economy weakened. The FRC has concluded that KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of the audit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FRC explains. In early 2008 HBOS concluded that its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 should be prepared on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd basis. HBOSdid not expect market conditions to worsen and judged that it would be able to fund itself. The auditor considered and accepted this conclusion. HBOS published its audited financial statements in February 2008 on that basis. The evidence of market conditions at that time did not show this decision of HBOS or the auditor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of it to be unreasonable at the time. KPMG has insisted that it challenged HBOS over its optimistic assumptions, and pushed the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top management to take larger provisions against bad loans (not large enough, though, it turned out) The pound is rallying this morning, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney dropped another hint that interest rates will rise soon. Sterling is up 0.3% against both the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.199, and the dollar at $1.354. Yesterday, Carney told an audience in Washington DC that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That makes it even more likely that the BoE will act in November. Although, as economist Sean Richards tweets, Carney has talked the talk before, but not delivered... MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All Country World Index, a broad measure of global shares, has hit a new record today. It struck 486.95 for the first time, thanks to the Nikkei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street action. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are nudging new all-time highs todays, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of puff. Last night, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s man stocks closed at new records, again, as investors prepared for Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the Federal Reserve. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones ended at new highs, driven by financial stocks. The rally comes ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting, where the US central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it plots a path to unwind its stimulus measures without upsetting the markets. Japan has now joined the rally too. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holiday, the Nikkei surged by almost 2% today. Easing geopolitical worries are pulling down the yen (which is good for Japanese exports and will be welcomed in Tokyo). Speculation that Japanese prime minister Abe might be planning to call a snap election also boosted confidence (not that snap elections always go as planned...). Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popularity has risen in recent months, so he could strengthen his grip on parliament. Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors were worried about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 before, but if he calls a snap election and his ruling party wins, it would strengthen the foundations of his once-weak government base.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure about Abexit either...] European markets are expected to cling onto yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six week highs. CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson explains that investors around the globe are waiting to see what the Fed announces, and says, tomorrow: US stock markets also continued where they left off on Friday posting new record highs as investors geared up for tomorrows Federal Reserve rate meeting and press conference, with the US central bank expected to embark on the first baby steps on the paring down of its balance sheet. Despite recent poor US economic data there still seems to be a belief amongst some in the markets that we could see one more rate hike this year, something that may well be borne out by tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate dot plot projections. Whether the projections survive their exposure to the real world of the hurricane clear up of Harvey and Irma is another matter, not to mention the prospect of further hurricanes with the latest in the form of Maria as it moves towards Puerto Rico. The latest geopolitical situation appears to have settled down for now but with President Trump set to speak at the United Nations later today it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too much of a surprise if North Korea decided to send him a message so to speak, perhaps in the form of another missile test. While the rhetoric appears to have settled down a touch it probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much to set it all off again. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our liveblog on Hurricane Maria, which has just battered Dominica: Traders will also be watching the latest eurozone economic data, to see if Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recover remains on track. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone construction output in July. It was stagnant in June, so a recovery would be welcome. 10am BST: ZEW survey of eurozone confidence. It is expected to improve slightly to 12.3, after sliding to just 10 in August. 1.30pm BST: US housing starts. Economists predict that 1.7% more housebuilding projects began in August, after a drop of 4.8% in July",

Fed chair Janet Yellen said the normalisation process would be gradual and predictable.</p> <p>Policymakers also left US interest rates unchanged, at 1.25% to 1.5%. The Fed committee expects to raise borrowing costs once more time this year, followed by three raises in 2018.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/20/us-federal-reserve-decision-janet-yellen-markets-uk-retail-business-live?page=with:block-59c2b43be4b0c40626e2ec49#block-59c2b43be4b0c40626e2ec49\">During her press conference</a></strong>, Yellen admitted that the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand why inflation hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t returned to target. She also predicted that the US economy would suffer short-term damage from Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria.</p> <p>But there was no new insight into Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future; the Fed chair hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t met with president Trump recently, and refused to say if she wanted to serve a second term once her first stint ends in February 2018.</p> <p>Investors are taking the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions well, with shares finishing a little higher in New York.</p> <p>The US dollar has jumped, while US government debt has weakened, as investors brace for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies to hit the markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/910567318043922432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Banks stocks rally as Fed aims for one more hike in 2017.

                "bodyText":"Right, time to wrap up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary. Almost a decade after the financial world plunged into its biggest crisis in generations, the US Federal Reserve has taken the landmark decision to start unwinding some of the stimulus it created to ward off a second Great Depression. The Fed will start cutting its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, initially by just $10bn per month. Fed chair Janet Yellen said the normalisation process would be gradual and predictable. Policymakers also left US interest rates unchanged, at 1.25% to 1.5%. The Fed committee expects to raise borrowing costs once more time this year, followed by three raises in 2018. During her press conference, Yellen admitted that the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand why inflation hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t returned to target. She also predicted that the US economy would suffer short-term damage from Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria. But there was no new insight into Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future; the Fed chair hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t met with president Trump recently, and refused to say if she wanted to serve a second term once her first stint ends in February 2018. Investors are taking the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions well, with shares finishing a little higher in New York. The US dollar has jumped, while US government debt has weakened, as investors brace for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies to hit the markets. From New York, my colleague Dominic Rushe sums up the day: The Federal Reserve has announced it will begin the great unwinding of the gargantuan stimulus programme it began close to a decade ago in the teeth of the worst recession in living memory. As widely expected, the Fed voted to start reducing its portfolio starting in October, and kept interest rates at a range of 1% to 1.25%. The move, announced after a two-day meeting by Fed officials, will start the gradual reduction of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities, bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The basic message here is that US economic performance has been good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision had been made because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we feel the US economy is performing well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but she added the Fed could reverse course if conditions changed.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW and NF Wall Street has taken today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news in its stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 share indices have both closed slightly higher, at new record highs. But... short-term US government debt continues to sell off. The yield (interest rate) on two-year Treasury bills is pushing higher, following the news that the Fed will trim its balance sheet. Reaction to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement keeps flooding in. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management predicts the Fed will unwind its balance sheet slowly, as it takes a step into the unknown. It has taken a decade for policymakers to begin to understand the effects of quantitative easing and with that debate still raging, markets will need to absorb the impact of its reversal. Because of the uncertainty this could entail, we expect the Fed to adopt a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo no harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. The fact that the Fed is even willing to begin this process indicates their confidence in the direction of the US economy and markets should not be perturbed by any new policy approach. Sophia Ferguson of State Street Global Advisors says the Fed will be watching economic data closely, especially following recent hurricane damage: In spite of record low unemployment and increasingly loose financial conditions, benign wage growth kept hawkish members of the committee grounded, with a downward drift in the longer-run expected policy rate path as represented by the dot plots. With 11 out of 16 participants calling for another rate hike before the end of the year, the decision to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.25% provides a welcome respite for the FOMC to evaluate the economic data over the coming weeks and months; the pause reduces the risk of pre-emptively removing policy accommodation, yet leaves ample fuel in the tank should inflation start to accelerate more aggressively than forecast in the second half of the year. James McCann of Aberdeen Asset Management says the Fed has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fired the starting gun\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on unwinding its QE programme. This is set to be a marathon, rather than a sprint, with a slow-but-steady runoff in Treasury and Mortgage Backed Security holdings to begin in October. This step reflects rising confidence that the recovery is sufficiently durable to withstand a slow withdrawal of emergency policy measures, a full ten years after the financial crisis struck. Nicholas Wall of Old Mutual Global Investors, says the Fed wanted to get its balance sheet reduction underway before the committee is shaken up next year (possibly with a new Fed chair). The strong economy and loose financial conditions also gives the central bank confidence that the market will be able to handle the extra bond issuance. Rick Rieder of asset management giant BlackRock predicts the European Central Bank will slow the pace of its own stimulus programme soon (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same as actually unwinding it, though) Back in the markets, investors now believe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 60% chance of a US interest rate rise in December, to 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 50% before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. And finally, a question that gets to the heart of the matter.... Q: Are you bothered that financial conditions are actually looser than before you raised interest rates four times? Yellen says the Federal Reserve has tightened policy since late 2015 because the US economy has been recovering, and the labor market has strengthened. There are risks on both sides to our objectives, she warns. Tighten too early, and we risk hurting the economy and keeping inflation permanently low. But wait too long, and we risk the economy overheating. That would ultimately force us to raise rates fast, leading to a recession. So the Fed is treading a careful path as we aim to hit our mandate, she concludes. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Reaction to follow..... Yellen expresses concern about the massive cyber attack at credit monitoring agency Equifax. She calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious breach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and urges Americans to carefully monitor their credit reports. Q: What would it take for the Fed to start QE again? Yellen gives a long answer, repeating that the Fed could potentially expand its balance sheet in future if there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the economy, meaning interest rate cuts weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a strong enough responce. Perhaps significantly, she talks about how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153future policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will have to decide this issue. A hint that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be renominated for a second term? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (deservedly) stinging criticism of Wells Fargo: Q: Will you take action against Wells Fargo over its huge misselling scandal? Yellen roasts Wells Fargo, saying its actions are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Egregious and unacceptable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Fed is working very hard to understand the root causes of Well Fargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, and decide the appropriate action. [Background: a year ago, we learned that Wells Fargo staff had created 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 consent, to meet their sales targets] Q: Will there be operational problems when vice-chair Stanley Fischer steps down (early) next month? It will deprive the Federal Reserve of its quorum of four governors. Yellen pays tribute to Fischer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to the Fed, saying she appreciated his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wise council and friendship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She says the Fed can carry out its duties with only three governors, but hopes that Congress will approve some new appointees to the Fed board. Asked about financial regulation, Yellen says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that reforms put in place since the crisis stay put. She adds that regulations could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctailored\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to avoid undue burden on the sector. Ah, the elephant in the room..... Q: Your current term expires in February 2018 - Have you discussed the situation with Donald Trump, or had any thoughts about your plans? Janet Yellen says she intends to serve her current tern, and will not comment on whether she wants to stays on beyond that. She has not had a further meeting with Trump, since one early meeting shortly after he became president. Refreshingly, Janet Yellen says the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why inflation is below target this year. We need to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153figures out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the factors are persistent of transitory, she adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet reduction plan: As expected, the Fed has fleshed out its plans for reining in the size of its balance sheet. This has ballooned since the financial crisis on the back of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive quantitative easing stimulus programme. The balance sheet has expanded to $4.5trn since the financial crisis. The plan is to start reducing it from next month and to progressively accelerate the rate at which bonds are returned to the public market. The Fed hopes that by telegraphing its $1trn to $2trn taper, it can avoid unsettling bond and equity markets. Yellen reminds the press conference that the Fed has now raised interest rates four times in this cycle, and it still thinks the recovery is on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong track\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: The Fed is locked into reducing its balance sheet, and raising interest rates in a gradual fashion. So what will you do if economic conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out as you expect? Yellen denies that the Fed is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclocked in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to a particular path. We are assessing incoming data, and these plans are subject to change. What won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change, though, is our commitment to delivering price stability and full employment, she adds. Yellen says that the Fed could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stop its balance sheet rolloff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in future, if adjusting interest rates is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insufficient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to respond to changes to the economic outlook. Q: Is the Fed concerned that markets are at, or close to, record highs? Yellen replies that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to see how asset prices will affect the economic outlook, but the Fed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking account of asset prices when setting monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Onto questions, and the first one is a zinger. Q: Why the Fed is unwinding its balance sheet when core inflation is consistently below target, and the unemployment rate for Black Americans is 8% (much higher than the 4.4% national average). Yellen replies that it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that inflation is below the 2% target. The Fed still believes it will rise, but will adjust policy if needed. Yellen repeats that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet will be shrunk gradually and predictably. It will start by cutting its holdings by up to $10bn per month this autumn; a small change designed to help the markets adjust. This cap will rise to $50bn per month by next autumn. But....she also flags up that the Fed could adjust its balance sheet in future, if circumstances demanded it. Policy is not on a preset cause, says Yellen - a reminder to the markets that events could yet force the Fed to chance course. On interest rates, Yellen says the Federal Fund Rate won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to rise much further to get back to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral stance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Yellen warns that US economic growth in the current quarter will be hurt by the recent hurricanes that battered Florida and Texas (as well as the Caribbean). Inflation will also be pushed higher, temporarily, because gasoline has become pricier. However, this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153materially\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd affect the long-term path of the economy, she adds. Yellen also expresses sympathy, on behalf of the Fed, for those who have suffered from Irma and Harvey. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has sat down to face the press and explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. She starts by predicting that the US economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will continue to expand over the next few years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accommodative monetary policy stance will help create more jobs. Yellen adds: We expect the job market will strengthen somewhat further\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 She says the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet reduction plan will be gradual and predictable. What does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreducing the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mean in practice? Well... once the financial crisis stuck, the US central bank created more than a trillion of new dollars to buy American government debt, and bonds backed by mortgages. This chart, from Bloomberg, reminds us how the Fed unleashed three quantitative easing programme in an attempt to prop up growth, fight unemployment and keep inflation higher. So now, the Fed is planning to cut back, by cutting the amount of assets on its books. Those QE programmes drove asset prices to record levels, such as bond prices and equities. Kully Samra, UK managing director of Charles Schwab, warns that markets could wobble once the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan gets underway. Robust fundamental data and solid corporate earnings should allow the bull market to continue, but political, fiscal and monetary uncertainties still present risks. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement today to start unwinding the balance sheet has already been priced in by markets, but we continue to believe the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quantitative tightening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be the cause of some heightened volatility, especially as the impact on the real economy remains largely unknown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street has reacted calmly to the news that the Fed will start unwinding its balance sheet in October. The main stock indices have dipped slightly, with the Dow down 0.25% and the S&amp;P 500 losing 0.1%. Cue the sarcasm: Skimming through the Fed statement, it appears that policymakers are still confident that the US economy is recovering. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. The dollar has jumped by 0.4%, reversing its weakness before the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Traders are reacting to the news that the Fed still expects to raise interest rates once more this year, and three times in 2018. In the markets, the yield on short-term US debt has jumped, meaning bond prices have fallen. The Fed also flags up the damage suffered by hurricanes in recent weeks. It predicts inflation could push higher in the short term, but hopes the US economy will bounce back: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship. Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term. Importantly, some Fed committee members have become more dovish about the path of interest rates in 2018. The new Dot Plot (in yellow) shows that two hawkish policymakers have pulled their horns in (one was expecting rates to hit 3% next year!) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very little consensus about where rates will be in 2019.... Boom! The Fed says it will start shrinking its balance sheet in October. That means it will beginning the task of unwinding the stimulus it injected into the US economy once the financial crisis began. Breaking! The Federal Reserve has left interest rates unchanged at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, at up to 1.25%. Fed policymakers are also sticking with their prediction of one more rate hike this year. More to follow... The dollar is dipping slightly as traders brace for the Fed statement to hit the wires. This has pushed the pound up to $1.359, up 0.8% of a cent today. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics predicts that the Fed will sound more dovish about interest rates today. He suspects they will drop the notion of another rate hike in 2017, and push it into 2018. Jones writes: While the federal funds rate is almost certain to stay on hold on this occasion, updates to FOMC members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 median forecasts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are currently for one more rate hike this year and three further three hikes in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be closely scrutinised as usual. Although we no longer expect the Fed to raise rates again in 2017, we are still expecting four rate hikes in 2018 as inflation rebounds. Wall Street is becalmed, with less than 30 minutes until the Fed announcement, which is followed by Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 2 points, or a measly 0.01%, having hit a record high last night. Do play along with Fed Bingo at home, or in the office. Fingers crossed, and seatbelts buckled, please.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is one of the most eagerly anticipated in a while. But what will Wall Street, the City, and investors around the world be looking for - and what will it mean for the rest of us? 1) Will the Fed raise interest rates today? Spoiler alert: this is seen as very unlikely. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen two US interest rate rises this year, and American inflation probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bubbling away enough to justify a third today. 2) So when will rates go up? Previously, the Fed has predicted it will raise borrowing costs three times in 2017, and it has already hiked in March and June. Today, it will release a new Dot Plot, showing how policymakers expect borrowing costs to move. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dots, and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike today, then a December hike would remain possible (but not certain). 3) Is it time to unwind the stimulus, and how? The big news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting will probably centre on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to normalise monetary policy and trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, including $2.5 trillion of US government debt. That balance sheet swelled during the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various QE stimulus programmes, mopping up hundreds of billions of dollars of government and mortgage-backed bonds. Economists predict that the Fed will announce that it will start unwinding this programme. But it may be reluctant to move fast. One option is to stop buying new bonds when existing debt matures. The Fed is the first of the Big Four central banks to reach this point, so it is treading a path which the ECB, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will hope to follow. 4) What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the hurricane damage? New economic forecasts will be released today, which may attempt to quantify the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. 5) Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in focus. Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term as Fed chair ends in early 2018. Is she considering running again, or ruling herself out following criticism from Donald Trump? She recently breakfasted with the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elder daughter, Ivanka, so reporters will want to hear Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking. 6) How do the markets take it? Investors seem remarkably relaxed about the prospect of QE being unwound, with markets at record highs. But might they have a change of heart when the deed is done? Loose monetary policy has driven asset prices higher for years, so withdrawing it could dent spirits.... World markets are hovering around new highs, with the MSCI All Country World Index up another 0.09% to 487.82. But overall investors are - mostly - sitting on their hands ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, due in just under two hours. The exception, as previously mentioned, is the Spanish market, which has been rattled by the tensions in Spain surrounding a proposed independence referendum for Catalonia. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 3.3 points or 0.05% at 7271.95 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.06% to 12,569.17 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.08% to 5241.66 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.31% to 22,355.58 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.83% lower at 10,292.1 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 0.64% to 757.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.1% at 22,392. Most European markets (and indeed the US as well) are treading water ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting. An exception is Spain, where the Ibex has dropped 1% after growing tensions over the proposed Catalonian independence referendum, with police arresting political officials in Barcelona. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With the exception of the IBEX 35, it has been an uninteresting day for European indices. Catalonia has been calling for a referendum on independence for some time, and the fragile state of the Spanish economy has exacerbated it. Spanish police have raided the headquarters of the Catalonian government and scenes of unrest on the back of this has weighed heavily on the Spanish market. The move by the Spanish authorities is likely to stoke independence calls, and this spooked investors. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, here is ING Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crib sheet: Oil prices have been moving higher recently on hopes that Opec and its partners would extend their production cuts designed to deal with a global supply glut. Indeed, crude is on track for its biggest third quarter gain in 13 years. However they have now come off their best levels after the US Energy Information Administration reported a bigger than expected rise in crude stocks last week. Markets continue to drift ahead of the Fed meeting. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite effectively not moving after the bell the Dow Jones still managed to flirt with a fresh all-time high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just how consistent it has been in the last 3 weeks. Whether it can continue to build may be dependent on how the dollar reacts to September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement from the Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which in turn could come to depend on a) how cautious Yellen and co. are in regards to reducing the $4.5 billion balance sheet, and b) what kind of (December) rate hike signals are sent out. For now, however, the greenback is sitting firmly on its hands. The dollar is down 0.3% against the pound, 0.1% against the yen and flat against the euro. Sterling is also up 0.2% against the euro, the currency receiving a bit of good news in the form of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly strong UK retail sales reading. As for the European indices, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength is once again weighing on the FTSE, which slipped 0.2% as the day went on having risen 0.3% during the morning. In the Eurozone there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot going on, with the CAC flat at 5225 and the DAX slipping below 12550 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if only just \u00e2\u20ac\u201c following a 0.1% fall. More weak data from the US, with the effects of Hurricane Harvey starting to be felt. US existing home sales fell 1.7% to 5.35m units in August, down from 5.44m in July and the lowest level since this time last year, mainly due to a lack of supply. The National Association of Realtors said Harvey, which hit Texas in the last week of August, had seen helped push sales in Houston down 25% year on year. Without that decline, existing home sales would have been unchanged in August. Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said: Steady employment gains, slowly rising incomes and lower mortgage rates generated sustained buyer interest all summer long, but unfortunately, not more home sales. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ailing the housing market and continues to weigh on overall sales is the inadequate levels of available inventory and the upward pressure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s putting on prices in several parts of the country. Sales have been unable to break out because there are simply not enough homes for sale. Some of the South region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in closings can be attributed to the devastation Hurricane Harvey caused to the greater Houston area. Sales will be impacted the rest of the year in Houston, as well as in the most severely affected areas in Florida from Hurricane Irma. However, nearly all of the lost activity will likely show up in 2018. Some deal news from Japan. Reuters reports: Toshiba Corp has agreed to sell its prized semiconductor business to a group led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, a key step in keeping the struggling Japanese conglomerate listed on the Tokyo exchange. Toshiba said it had signed a contract for the deal worth about 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the latest and perhaps final twist in a deal that only hours earlier had seen the company leading toward an agreement with its U.S. joint venture partner Western Digital Corp. The decision to sell the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No. 2 producer of NAND memory chips... was made at a board meeting earlier in the day. Toshiba said the agreement assumed the deal would weather legal challenges raised by Western Digital. A Western Digital spokeswoman said the company did not have an immediate comment. US investors are in wait and see mode ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision and the press conference from chair Janet Yellen. But markets still remain at record levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 both edged up 0.01% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.04%. If the US Federal Reserve is more hawkish than expected on interest rates and its balance sheet plans, then the US dollar could move sharply higher after its recent weakness, reckons Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: In making their decisions, policymakers at the Fed are likely to take into account last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharper-than-expected rise in CPI inflation, and weigh this against somewhat softer macro pointers elsewhere in the economy. But with employment remaining healthy and inflation being so close to its target, the Fed may get the market ready for another rate rise in December and also provide a plan for balance sheet normalisation. In other words, the Fed may be more hawkish than dovish at this meeting. If so, we would expect the dollar to rip, especially against currencies where the central bank is still very dovish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. This outcome may also be modestly negative for the US stock markets. If the dollar rises and stocks fall, then gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response may be relatively muted, although as a dollar-denominated commodity it too should fall. Obviously if the Fed comes across as more dovish than hawkish then one would expect the opposite reaction in these markets. After hitting record highs last night, Wall Street is expected to open calmly in 30 minutes time. That means the MSCI World stocks index remains at record levels, after fairly unspectacular sessions in Asia and Europe today. Investors are braced for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting at 2pm East Coast time, followed by Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. As explained earlier, the Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to raise interest rates today, but it will give new guidance about future rate hikes. Crucially, it is also expected to outline how, and when, it will start unwinding its huge stimulus programme. Investors are hoping that Fed chair Janet Yellen and colleagues will tread cautiously to avoid causing market upheaval. But are they too relaxed? Unravelling a $4.5 trillion balance sheet is no easy task; any gyrations in bond prices or the US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value will have global ramifications, potentially triggering surges of capital around the world. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale, the French bank, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting will all be about BSN - balance sheet normalisation. Starting BSN if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right term, is a return to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeace-time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy before Janet Yellen departs (if she does). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an leap into relative unknown (never been done before) which is happening into a market which seems as relaxed as a teenager getting ready for a bungee jump. This market knows no fear. A thought for the day, as we await news from the Fed: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in Russia today, as one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks seeks help. B&amp;N has sought a bailout from the central bank; making it the second bank to hit trouble in three weeks. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Max Seddon has more details: B&amp;N Bank, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12th largest bank by assets, is one of three top privately held banks highly exposed to Otkritie \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest private lender until the central bank rescued it last month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through an informal group known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garden Ring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The central bank estimates Otkritie may have a balance sheet hole of up to 400bn rubles; senior Russian bankers say the final total may be twice that. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has confirmed it is in talks with B&amp;N\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners and will decide on a bailout in the near future. Reuters has an interesting line too.... B&amp;N Bank staff declined to comment outside its head office, three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Kremlin, while a truck belonging to a firm called Shredder Express, which offers mobile document shredding, was parked on a private road in front All this week, the Guardian has been turning a spotlight on the escalating problem of debt in the UK. Today, the boss of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest doorstep lender, has told us about how illegal money lenders are targeting council estates, in search of vulnerable customers to sign up. Paul Smith, the chief executive of Morses Club, claims that people who have been turned down by official lenders are most at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Loan sharks live in the same block of flats that our customers live in, they live in the same council estates, they drink in the same pubs, they go to the same betting shops. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a loan shark, a loan shark finds you. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So the typical approach would be at a school gate to a mother: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI see your kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toes are hanging out of their shoes, it breaks my heart.

Mauricio No\u00c3\u00a9, who is heading up the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European expansion, said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU was a factor No\u00c3\u00a9 told Irelands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 RTE radio that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit did influence us coming to Dublin \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth taking the risk on London, and actually Dublin is a good alternative and maybe better in some ways.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd KBRA is the latest in a series of financial services operations to set up in Dublin as a means of maintaining or gaining access to the European single market in the event of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU. Yesterday, the Irish prime minister announced that one of largest insurance syndicates at Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London, XL group, was moving its European headquarters to the Irish capital as part of the three way battle with Luxembourg and Paris for the insurance sector Brexit spoils. No\u00c3\u00a9 said Dublin didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the cluster of talent that London has. So, he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aggressively targeting Irish diaspora in London and New York, particularly people with Irish girlfriends or wives to see if they would come back home to Dublin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if the soaring cost of housing - rental and sales - was a deterrent, he replied. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost of housing is not so much the issue, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s families ties, as it is always in moving people from one country to another.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart highlights how Britons spent more on non-food items in August, and also relied more on internet shopping and catalogues (non-store spending). Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management argues that this is an encouraging sign that consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead and buried\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite Brexit uncertainty. This is a promising sign for an industry that investors have shunned in recent months due to headwinds such as a rising minimum wage, and higher input costs in line with the Sterling fall. The pound is now moving in the right direction for importers, and moderate inflation could be coming into play - lessening competitive pressures and making it easier for these companies to absorb rising input costs. Notably the performance of non-store retailers is impressive, and demonstrates a continued trend towards online shopping, which in itself makes retailers more international, and less vulnerable to a weak pound. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take: Credit Suisse has joined the ranks of City experts predicting that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in November, from 0.25% to 0.5%. But they add a proviso - such a rate hike would be a mistake. In a new report to clients today, Credit Suisse argues that the UK economy hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the point where monetary policy needs to be tightened. In their view, growth is too weak, especially as Brexit is creating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short-term political noise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They say: We think the BoE has misdiagnosed the amount of slack and growth potential in the UK economy. The hike is unlikely to have a profoundly negative impact on the economy, but there is a risk of a non-linear response to the first rate hike in ten years. A tighter response to an (entirely) externally driven inflation overshoot today runs the risk of a sustained inflation undershoot in the future. Jamie McGeever of Reuters also questions whether UK wages are really rising fast enough to justify a hike. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will lag behind most international rivals next year, as the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery strengthens That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the OECD, which has just updated its economic forecasts. The good news is that the Paris-based thinktank sees Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy catching up with America. In particular, it has hiked its forecast for Italian growth to 1.2%, from 0.8%. The OECD says: The upturn has become more synchronised across countries. Investment, employment and trade are expanding. But the bad news is that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is expected to slow, from 1.6% in 2016 to just 1% in 2018. That would put the UK at the bottom of the G7 growth league! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the OECB forecasts: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, reckons UK shops benefitted because more people stayed at home this summer (as foreign holidays are rather pricier since the Brexit vote). He also believes that the first UK interest rate in a decade is imminent: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is encouraging that retail sales proved resilient and bounced back in August. Anecdotal reports from retailers suggest that spending may have been helped by more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staycations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in response to the weakness of the pound which pushes up the cost of overseas travel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The underlying picture has not changed greatly, though. In the past three months, retail sales volumes were just over 2 percent up on a year ago - and the annual growth rate has been hovering around 2 percent for most of this year. This is substantially below the growth rate of around 4.5 percent recorded in the three years 2014 to 2016 when inflation was much lower. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These latest figures will give further encouragement to the Bank of England to follow up their recent statements on the need to raise interest rates. The first rise in UK interest rates for over a decade has now become even more likely - and we could see this happen at the next MPC meeting in November.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hold on a moment, though. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest healthcheck on the UK economy suggests that consumers are cutting back. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Agents Survey, just released, suggests that cautious shoppers are cutting back, or buying cheaper items. Higher inflation, though, means they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having to pay more at the tills. The survey is based on interviews with around 700 companies across the UK. Here are the key points: Consumer spending growth had eased slightly further in values terms. Manufacturing output growth had risen again, with exports supported by the past fall in sterling. Investment intentions were consistent with modest growth in spending over the year ahead. Recruitment difficulties had edged higher and broadened slightly. Pay awards were clustered around 2%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3%. Consumer goods price inflation had picked up further, largely reflecting the effects of the past fall in sterling feeding through into retail prices. Consumer services price inflation had also edged higher Jake Trask, FX research director at OFX, reckons the jump in retail spending in August will encourage Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to raise interest rates soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the Bank of England, this data is yet more evidence that an interest rate hike is needed sooner rather than later, in an effort to get inflation back under control. Should CPI print 3% or higher in October, then we may see a rate hike as early as November, when the next quarterly Inflation Report is due. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Former Monetary Policy Committee doves, Andrew Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe, have already indicated that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re close to switching sides, so the Bank will only need one other Committee member to join them before the rate can rise back to pre-Referendum levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The acceleration in UK retail sales last month is surprising, given household incomes are being squeezed by inflation. It may show that people are borrowing more, warns Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: Economics journalist Dharshini David also flags this up: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that these monthly figures can be volatile... ...but the underlying picture is that people are still spending. UK retail sales have now risen for three months in a row, as this chart shows: Breaking! UK retail sales were much stronger than expected in August. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail sales jumped by 1.0% last month, beating City forecasts, and suggesting that consumers are still hitting the high street. The ONS says: In August 2017, the quantity bought (volume) in the retail sales industry increased by 1.0% compared with July 2017; with other non-food stores and non-store retailing as the main contributors to growth. Compared with August 2016, the quantity bought increased by 2.4%; the 52nd consecutive month of year-on-year increase in retail sales. Year-on-year contribution of food stores remains flat whilst there was a fall in the contribution of growth within petrol stations, showing that contributions to the overall growth came from non-essential items. This has sent the pound jumping over half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.3587, as traders calculate that this makes a November interest rate rise more likely. Reaction to follow.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small businesses don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the sense of optimism in the markets. Confidence among UK firms has taken a tumble in the last three months, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Small Business Index has dropped to just +1 this quarter, down from +15 in April-June, and near to the -3 seen after last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Mike Cherry, FSB National Chairman, blamed economic factors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising inflationary pressure and a weakening domestic economy are the twin drivers of plummeting confidence among small firms and consumers alike. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big news in the steel industry this morning. Tata Steel has signed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153memorandum of understanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with German steel manufacturer ThyssenKrupp to merge, creating Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest steel group. This ends uncertainty over the future of Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in the UK, including the Port Talbot steelworkers which was recently threatened with closure. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news; Tata and ThyssenKrupp are already planning around 4,000 job cuts. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jonathan Eley sees further consolidation ahead: Unions have said they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cautiously welcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the deal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank fears that markets could react badly if the Federal Reserve announces that it will start unwinding its stimulus programme, and cut the size of its balance sheet. He argues that investors are simply too relaxed, given the risks of geopolitical instability around the globe: The big news event on 20 September will be the report of the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Market Committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we believe the central bank will finally announce plans to start selling its massive holding of bonds. This is likely to begin in October. Meanwhile, the Fed is unlikely to move interest rates. What does this mean for the US dollar? Possibly a shock. Markets are calm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too calm, really, like those western films where the sheriff rides into an empty town. Despite the tensions in North Korea and the Middle East, despite a see-sawing US president, despite implied volatility, willingness to take risks is historically unprecedented, which we know could end in tears. Markets continue to rationalize this, by seeing low inflation, solid growth and gradual central bank normalization. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not so sure. A balance-sheet unloading could end the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfeel good\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 environment, sending both bond and stock markets southward. Asian markets remained calm today, despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctotally destroy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 North Korea. The South Korean won strengthened a little, shrugging off Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable attack on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrocket man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Kim Jong Un. European markets have also opened softly too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 9 points to 7283, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX pretty flat. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Despite myriad different macro-events fighting for attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including a deadly earthquake in Mexico, the latest hurricane devastation in the Caribbean, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sabre-rattling speech at the UN and Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit boasting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the markets are only interested in one thing this Wednesday: September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. World stock markets are at record highs as investors await tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve decision. The MSCI All Country World Index has nudged up to 487.66, up from 487.37 yesterday. That extends its recent run of record highs, as markets begin the autumn in good spirits. That follows another solid day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P both hit record highs. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Investors are buckling up for another Fed policy update which may contain news and/or hints about the timing of further policy tightening by way of balance sheet unwinding and the next rate hike. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe have one thing at the top of their agenda today - the Federal Reserve. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central bankers are meeting today to set monetary policy, and it could be a red letter day in the recovery from the financial crisis. The Fed is expected to take the historic move to start unwinding its massive stimulus programme, concluding that the US economy is strong enough to cope without a helping hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Massive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an understatement. After the crisis began in 2008, the Fed bought tens of billions of dollars of government bonds each month, swelling its balance sheet to a mighty $4.5 trillion. It now has to decide how to unwind this money-printing programme without spooking the financial markets. The Fed is likely to tread carefully; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not expected to raise interest rates today, for example. Policymakers will also indicate whether they expect borrowing costs to rise this year, and where they expect rates to peak in a few years, by using the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous Dot Plot. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the old dot plot (each blob shows where one Fed committee member expects rates to be each year). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrangement of dots will be closely scrutinised, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: The element that investors are going to pay a lot of attention is the update on the dot plot. We expect the Fed to show more softer approach to the future interest rate hike. According to their last projection, the Fed expected seven rate hikes by the end of 2019. However, in the new forecast, the market is widely expecting them to drop one interest rate hike. The immediate question is whether the Fed still expects to make one more interest rise this year (assuming they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike tonight). The Fed will also release new economic forecasts, and could also talk about the impact which the hurricane season will have on US growth. The markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sure what to expect, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at a cautious day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading until the Fed announcement comes at 7pm UK time, or 2pm in New York. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for August. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to be flat month-on-month, having risen 0.5% in July. 10am BST: OECD publishes its latest global economic outlook. Will it repeat its warning of a Brexit slowdown in 2018? 7pm BST: Federal Reserve decision released. 7.30 BST: Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference",

The consultancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets economist Oliver Jones said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Risky asset markets took the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly-hawkish tone on Wednesday in their stride. We think that they will remain resilient over the next year and a half or so, even though we forecast that the Fed will hike rates once a quarter between now and the early 2019.</p> <p>The US dollar and Treasury yields rose after the conclusion of the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting on Wednesday in response to the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signal that it is likely to raise the federal funds rate in December, despite the weakness of core inflation and the effects of the recent hurricanes. (The Fed also announced the start of balance sheet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but this was widely expected.) </p> <p>In the event, there was little reaction in risky asset markets. The S&amp;P 500 was almost unchanged on the day, and movements in emerging market equities were small. This might be partly due to the fact that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone was not a huge surprise. But a couple of other factors have probably helped risky assets to be resilient too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just on Wednesday but throughout the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tightening cycle so far. We think that these factors will continue to provide support this year and next, even if the Fed hikes rates as we expect. </p> <p>First, there has been little to suggest that higher rates are dragging on economic growth, and we expect this to remain the case in 2017 and 2018. The US economy has expanded at a healthy pace since the Fed started hiking and we forecast it will continue to do so this year and next...</p> <p>Second, the likelihood that interest rates will ultimately remain quite low, even if they rise in the coming quarters, has probably supported the valuations of risky assets. Despite their hawkish near-term signal on Wednesday, FOMC participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 median forecast for the level of the federal funds rate in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fell by 25bp, to 2.75%, the lowest since these projections were first published in 2012...</p> <p>Taking this all into account, we think that risky asset prices will continue to hold up well as the Fed applies the brakes in the next eighteen months or so. However, we suspect that the lagged effects of higher rates will eventually begin to take their toll on the US economy as the Fed reaches the end of its tightening cycle in 2019. If the US economy did falter, risky asset prices globally would probably fall quite sharply. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59c3e22ce4b0c2f349fe2af0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-21T16:02:02.480Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bank shares have been boosted by the prospect of higher interest rates, in the wake of the US Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday.

Expectations of households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 future financial situation have been improving too and there are few doubts related to the historically low expectations of unemployment in the coming 12 months.</p> <p>While expectations of economic growth in the coming years are modest, as the Eurozone is expected to revert to a weaker growth trend, buoyant consumers are helping GDP growth to remain above trend for a while.</p> <p>For the ECB, the euphoric consumer is another sign that cautious increases in upward price pressures are likely to continue.

In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances. </p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi said European banks still had too many non-performing loans on their books:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets remains high. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy.</p> <p>At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal. And legislators need to be mindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond the banking sector. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"941e946b30a2c4b65388c9ece0b0850448a26a92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/941e946b30a2c4b65388c9ece0b0850448a26a92/29_0_2943_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Draghi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Roland/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-21T14:48:31.551Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59c3bea5e4b0c40626e2f06b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-21T13:44:45.641Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Capita staff strike in pensions row</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Trouble is brewing at UK outsourcing group Capita, as staff vote to hold a six-day strike in a dispute over pensions. </strong></p> <p>Members of the Unite union will walk out from October 5 after voting heavily in favour of industrial action. </p> <p>Unite are protesting against plans to close the current defined benefit pension scheme and transfer staff to a defined contribution scheme. </p> <p>Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension proposals will have far-reaching consequences for the retirement of many Unite members. </p> <p>Some staff will lose a shocking 70% of their retirement income. </p> <p>Capita has once again put the interests of shareholders before those of its staff.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlanJonesPA/status/910860981072535552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Workers at outsourcing group Capita are to stage a six-day strike next month in a dispute over pensions - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/unitetheunion\">@unitetheunion</a></p>&mdash; Alan Jones (@AlanJonesPA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlanJonesPA/status/910860981072535552\">September 21, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The move comes as Capita reported that profits fell by 26% in the first half of 2017.

                "bodyText":"After their record breaking runs, US markets paused for breath following the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement it would begin winding down the stimulus programme which has been supporting the economy since the financial crisis. The reaction in Europe was fairly subdued, with most markets heading higher. But continuing strength in the pound - now up 0.6% at $1.3573 - saw the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index slip back slightly. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped by 8.05 points or 0.11% to 7263.90 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.25% to 12,600.03 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.49% at 5267.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,491.73 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.05% at 10,297.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.06% to 765.99 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 38 points or 0.17%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Riskier markets have shrugged off the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of another rate rise this year, but could fall sharply in time if the US economy shows signs of flagging, says Capital Economics. The consultancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets economist Oliver Jones said: Risky asset markets took the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly-hawkish tone on Wednesday in their stride. We think that they will remain resilient over the next year and a half or so, even though we forecast that the Fed will hike rates once a quarter between now and the early 2019. The US dollar and Treasury yields rose after the conclusion of the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting on Wednesday in response to the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signal that it is likely to raise the federal funds rate in December, despite the weakness of core inflation and the effects of the recent hurricanes. (The Fed also announced the start of balance sheet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but this was widely expected.) In the event, there was little reaction in risky asset markets. The S&amp;P 500 was almost unchanged on the day, and movements in emerging market equities were small. This might be partly due to the fact that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone was not a huge surprise. But a couple of other factors have probably helped risky assets to be resilient too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just on Wednesday but throughout the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tightening cycle so far. We think that these factors will continue to provide support this year and next, even if the Fed hikes rates as we expect. First, there has been little to suggest that higher rates are dragging on economic growth, and we expect this to remain the case in 2017 and 2018. The US economy has expanded at a healthy pace since the Fed started hiking and we forecast it will continue to do so this year and next... Second, the likelihood that interest rates will ultimately remain quite low, even if they rise in the coming quarters, has probably supported the valuations of risky assets. Despite their hawkish near-term signal on Wednesday, FOMC participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 median forecast for the level of the federal funds rate in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fell by 25bp, to 2.75%, the lowest since these projections were first published in 2012... Taking this all into account, we think that risky asset prices will continue to hold up well as the Fed applies the brakes in the next eighteen months or so. However, we suspect that the lagged effects of higher rates will eventually begin to take their toll on the US economy as the Fed reaches the end of its tightening cycle in 2019. If the US economy did falter, risky asset prices globally would probably fall quite sharply. Bank shares have been boosted by the prospect of higher interest rates, in the wake of the US Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The prospect of higher rates in the key US market, and indeed even the possibility of a modest rate rise in the UK, has prompted investors to buy up financial services stocks in hope of better margins and improved profits and dividends. Europe has been bolstered by a weaker euro, as Janet Yellen manages to do what Mario Draghi could not or would not, with last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguably more hawkish statement putting some fight back into the US dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech from Draghi stayed off the topic of monetary policy, thus providing little for euro bulls to go on. The eurozone consumer confidence figures were at their highest level for about 16 years, says ING Bank. Its senior eurozone economist Bert Colijn said: The current economic environment in the Eurozone continues to be very favourable to the consumer, as job growth accelerates, wage growth has begun to improve, and inflation remains below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. This helps the Eurozone economy as more confident consumers continue to boost household demand. While the breakdown of individual questions from the September survey has not been released yet, recent data shows expectations of major purchases in the coming year have jumped to levels last seen before the crisis, which is in line with an increasingly positive assessment of personal finances. Expectations of households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 future financial situation have been improving too and there are few doubts related to the historically low expectations of unemployment in the coming 12 months. While expectations of economic growth in the coming years are modest, as the Eurozone is expected to revert to a weaker growth trend, buoyant consumers are helping GDP growth to remain above trend for a while. For the ECB, the euphoric consumer is another sign that cautious increases in upward price pressures are likely to continue. But consumer expectations of price trends have been falling since January, indicating that consumers are not expecting the Goldilocks economy to end anytime soon. In the eurozone, consumer confidence rose by more than expected in September. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial estimate showed confidence among consumers rise from -1.5 in August to -1.2, better than the unchanged reading that analysts had been forecasting. In the wider European Union consumer sentiment rose by 0.8 points to -1.5. After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have lost some ground in the wake of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. News that the Fed was still considering another interest rate rise this year and would begin cutting its $4.5bn worth of bond holdings has seen investors take a more cautious tone. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 0.14% to 22,380 while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.18% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 0.38%. Monetary policy cannot tackle local financial imbalances in the eurozone area, and individual governments need to rely on their own tools to solve these issues, says European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. In a speech in Frankfurt at the second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board, he said: Financial and business cycles can potentially become de-synchronised, meaning that financial imbalances can grow in an environment characterised by relatively muted inflation. In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances. Draghi said European banks still had too many non-performing loans on their books: Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets remains high. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks. Draghi concluded: Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy. At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal. And legislators need to be mindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond the banking sector. Trouble is brewing at UK outsourcing group Capita, as staff vote to hold a six-day strike in a dispute over pensions. Members of the Unite union will walk out from October 5 after voting heavily in favour of industrial action. Unite are protesting against plans to close the current defined benefit pension scheme and transfer staff to a defined contribution scheme. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension proposals will have far-reaching consequences for the retirement of many Unite members. Some staff will lose a shocking 70% of their retirement income. Capita has once again put the interests of shareholders before those of its staff. The move comes as Capita reported that profits fell by 26% in the first half of 2017. That sent its shares slumping by 12% today, making it the worst-performing major share in London. Capita has its fingers in a lot of pies, from collecting TV licence money to assessing whether disabled people are entitled to personal independence payments. But the last few months have been tough; it fell out of the FTSE 100 after a grim profits warning, and it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed to replace its CEO..... The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Arthur Beesley has written about this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ryanair AGM. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: At the AGM, a number of shareholders challenged Mr O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary, who took personal responsibility for the cancellations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do have the sackcloth on. I have apologised personally to all of those passengers and to the ones we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not going to back to gung-ho management.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shareholder Brian Graham, a retired mechanic, who questioned Mr O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary during the meeting said it was clear that there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no goodwill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the chief executive and pilots. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it happened anywhere else he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be asking for heads to roll,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Graham said. But Mr O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said there will be no dismissals as a result of the affair, saying the board was holding him to account by requiring him to resolve the matter. More here: Ryanair pilots face holiday threat Over in America, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a sharp fall in the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit.

S&amp;P warned that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s build-up of debt is a growing concern, as it cuts its rating by one notch, to A+ from AA-. S&amp;P claimed that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased its economic and financial risks. Although this credit growth had contributed to strong real gross domestic product growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beijing may not appreciate the timing, just weeks before the Communist party holds its key five-yearly congress. But is S&amp;P right? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that Chinese companies have been borrowing at a worrying rate, and that its shadow banking sector conceals some dubious debts. This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how corporate debt has swelled -- and that bill could easily land back on the government. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t new. And the Chinese government has been taking steps to avoid a financial crisis, without slowing growth too much, Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, argues that China is actually safer than before... Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has recovered some of its early losses, and is now down just 0.7% today. The news that the airline plans to hire 125 new pilots ASAP could be reassuring traders. But this still means the airline has lost almost 10% of its value this week. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: The flight cancellations and fraught negotiations with pilots have overshadowed what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill AGM for Ryanair. Ryanair shares dipped as Chief Executive Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary apologised to shareholders for the management failure. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Rob Davies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the Ryanair annual general meeting: Ryanair boss Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has escalated the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dispute with pilots, saying they do not have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and claiming he can force them to give up a week of leave. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary is scrambling to prevent more disruption to the no-frills airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schedule after last week cancelling up to 50 flights a day due to a rota \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mess-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that left it short of pilots. Speaking at Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM in Dublin on Thursday, the famously outspoken airline chief admitted that further cancellations could follow but refused to back down in a dispute with pilots. A group of pilots on Wednesday turned down an offer of up to \u00c2\u00a312,000 to keep flying during their scheduled leave, many of them putting their names to a letter demanding improved employment terms instead.... More here: Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary appears to be taking a carrot and stick approach with his pilots, warning that if they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misbehave there will be no goodies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also downplayed the news that some pilots are planning to work to rule, saying: If you want and need to ask your staff to give up holidays no work to rule can alter that. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has acknowledged that criticism of Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay structure has merit, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe we have got it a bit on the low side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But he also denies that staff are up in arms, claiming there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge co-operation and support from pilots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And asked about the causes of the crisis that forced up to 50 flights to be cancelled each week, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We make mistakes. This time we made a major boo boo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A very big block of annual leave (for pilots) was over-allocated for September, October and November,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to PA and Reuters for the quotes) Reuters have more details on Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay offer to pilots: Ryanair will hand pilots at some of its largest bases a 10,000 euro annual pay rise on top of a 12,000 euro bonus offered this week to those who help the airline alleviate a pilot shortage, Chief Executive Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said on Thursday. Pilots were offered the bonus in exchange for working an additional 10 days to plug a shortage that last week forced Ryanair to cancel more than 2,000 flights in September and October. Pilots at London Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin have now been offered an additional 10,000 euros per year, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary told a news conference. Similar offers may be made at other airports, but that will depend on whether those bases have a surplus of pilots, he said Back in London, the Treasury has welcomed the drop in UK borrowing in August to \u00c2\u00a35.7bn, from almost \u00c2\u00a37bn. A spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have made substantial progress in reducing the deficit, whilst taking a balanced approach that allows us to invest in our infrastructure and public services. This approach is working but the national debt is still too high, so we must continue to live within our means and start reducing our debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Darren McCaffrey has just tweeted a video clip of Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary denying that his pilots are overworked, or doing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Ryanair boss says: If there are fatigue issues among pilots....on short-haul flying it is never as a result of flying. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM: Ryanair is planning to take back one week of its pilots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 holidays to prevent any further flight cancellations, the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive has said. Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said pilots due to take a four-week block of holidays in the next few months because a change in annual leave rotas will be told to reduce that to three weeks. He said they will get the other week back in January. At a meeting with shareholders at the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM in Dublin, Mr O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said the airline does not need the agreement of pilots to take back a week of their leave. He told shareholders six weeks of cancellations, which he previously admitted was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, has cost the airline about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25m (\u00c2\u00a322m). Mr O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary again apologised for the disruption, which he said was down to mismanagement of the pilots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rostering system. He refused to discuss media reports that many pilots had turned down offers of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12,000 (\u00c2\u00a310,600) bonus and instead demanded improved contracts. Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has revealed that Dublin-based pilots are getting a pay rise, and it will be offered to staff at some other bases too. But....the president of the Irish Airline Pilots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association has said Ryanair needs a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the way it deals with pilots. Evan Cullen, who heads the pilots group, outlined the extraordinary employment structure which leaves them at an arms length relationship. Instead of being employed as staff, they are grouped into mini-companies which provide service to a UK company which in turn provides Ryanair with its pilots, said Cullen in a BBC interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the main pillars in the grievance, is that many of the Ryanair pilots do not have a fixed permanent contract,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Newsnight. The full interview starts here at around 27 minutes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This means that pilots are grouped into companies, into Irish companies which have between five and eight pilot directors, those companies then subcontract into a UK labour provider of pilots and then that UK provider provides the pilot labour into Ryanair. This gives an extraordinary arms length distance between Ryanair and the pilot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cullen explained. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has to be a fundamental change in how Ryanair deals with its pilots. Unfortunately the latest offers from Ryanair means it is a sticking plaster approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the point of anger is with the pilots, that Ryanair don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be taking seriously the fundamental grievance about the precarious nature of the employment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He predicted that some newly qualified Ryanair pilots were merely waiting for their start dates in order to quit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ryanair is not competing in the market place, there are many pilots that have left Ryanair such as the 140 to Norwegian Airlines but also many airlines throughout Europe have a holding pool of pilots and that holding pool is where the pilots have successfully competed the application process but awaiting a start date. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that many of the pilots in these holding pools are actually Ryanair pilots waiting for a start date and when they get that start date they will then issue Ryanair with their notice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Back in Dublin, Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary is continuing to answer questions over Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flight cancellations. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told the AGM that Ryanair doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough pilots to cover September, October and November, which is why it may force pilots to delay some holidays. The budget airline boss also announced plans to hire an extra 125 pilots, soon, to handle the shortages which forced flights to be cut. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary also told investors that the situation is now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunder control\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but warns that further cancellations can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out Chris Choi of ITV News is also at the AGM, and reports that some shareholders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says Philip Hammond will welcome the drop in public borrowing in August. With the deficit below forecasts, Hawksworth believes chancellor Hammond could have some extra flexibility to boost spending in the budget. Back in March, the OBR forecast that the budget deficit would rise to around \u00c2\u00a358 billion this year, but the latest data suggest that it may be similar to the \u00c2\u00a346 billion outturn for 2016/17. This would imply a budget deficit of just over 2% of GDP this year, which is already close to the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medium term target for the deficit in 2020. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of this suggests that the Chancellor should have room for some easing of austerity in his Budget in November. This could involve extra money for priorities such as the NHS, social care, housing and infrastructure investment as well as some further relaxation of the public sector pay cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Howard Archer of EY Item Club on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finances: Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell MP, points out that the government has still failed to eliminate the UK deficit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures are yet another reminder of the last seven years of failed Tory economic policy, following on from the OECD just yesterday predicting growth in our economy to continue to slow next year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After one year in the job Philip Hammond has continued the record of failure of his predecessor. The deficit has still not been eliminated, the national debt continues to rise, yet the Chancellor is carrying on with austerity cuts that are weakening our economy further, and hitting the incomes of working families. The big picture of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances is that Britain now owes almost \u00c2\u00a31.8 trillion, or 88% of annual economic output. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances also suggest that Britain might borrow less than expected this financial year. The annual deficit had been forecast to rise to \u00c2\u00a358.3bn, from \u00c2\u00a351.7bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but borrowing since April is actually below expectations. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances were stronger than expected in August. Britain borrowed just \u00c2\u00a35.56bn to balance the books last month, the ONS reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest deficit for any August since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from \u00c2\u00a36.9bn a year ago, and below City forecasts. The public finances were boosted by higher-than-expected tax receipts, in another boost for chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. This means that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public borrowing this financial year is \u00c2\u00a3200m lower than a year ago, at \u00c2\u00a328.3bn. Crumbs! Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary is telling shareholders that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holiday from pilots, to fix the rota shortages that forced flight cancellations. If that happens, pilots would receive extra pay for that week, he promises. Newsflash: Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has apologised to shareholders at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM over the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flight cancellations. It also claims that it will have dealt with 95% of customers affected, by the end of the week. In a statement to the City, Ryanair says: Ryanair CEO Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary apologised to shareholders, and again to customers, for the cancellation of 2,100 of its over 103,000 flights over a 6 week period in September and October, due to a failure within its pilot rostering function. Ryanair expects by the end of this week to have re-accommodated (or authorised refund requests to) over 95% of the 315,000 customers affected by these cancellations. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a small revolt against the pay received by Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass, with only 88% of shareholders backing its renumeration report. But O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary himself has been reelected with 99.3% of votes. Chairman David Bonderman also survived efforts to unseat him, with 89.1% of shareholders voting for his re-election. Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM is up and running: Shares in Ryanair have fallen by 1.5% in early trading, extending their recent losses. Our story revealing that pilot are now planning to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwork to rule\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is fuelling concerns that Ryanair could be forced to cancel even more flights, hitting its profitability. ETX Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Wilson explains: Shares in Ryanair have slipped 10% since it announced plans to cancel flights. The selloff this morning is all about mounting concern over rising cost pressures which are likely to hit margins and profits. Pilots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rejection of a one-off bonus to work extra hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a move that management would have liked to pull off in order to lessen the damage being done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has investors worried that not only may more flights be cancelled, but also that Ryanair is walking into a protracted battle with pilots at the very worst moment. At the very least, getting pilots to work more hours might have resulted in the airline not having to cancel any more flights. At present there is a risk that Ryanair will be forced to cancel more flights over the coming weeks. Ryanair shareholders are gathering in Dublin for the budget airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM, and it could be a very bumpy ride. Investors were already planning to revolt against executive pay at the airline, and vote against and the re-election of chairman David Bonderman. That was before this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle over staff holidays, which means thousands of passengers are suffering flight cancellations. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Vincent jokes: Ryanair could sell tickets for its AGM later today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the fact that it would probably have to cancel a whole load of them at very short notice owing to a mess-up with its boardroom holiday rota. Sky New\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Darren McCaffrey has landed outside the meeting, but is having trouble getting through security..... Disappointingly, Janet Yellen didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give us any new clues yesterday on whether she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll seek a second term when her current stint as Fed chair ends in February. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions has put Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in doubt. Potential replacements include veteran investment banker Gary Cohn (currently director of the National Economic Council), or former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Donovan has a more outlandish suggestion, though.... The Financial Times says the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to start unwinding QE is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The Times say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end of an era\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The strength of the US dollar has pulled sterling back down to $1.348, away from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-year high over $1.36. The euro has also taken a hit, down over one cent to below $1.19. Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, says Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic tone has helped to drive the dollar up. The greenback rallied overnight as Fed chair Yellen signalled the official end to QE and crucially kept the door ajar for rate hikes this year despite split opinions on inflation trajectory among members. Considering the catastrophes of late in the form of hurricanes, a sanguine approach from the Fed left markets aware a hike in December is still very much on the cards. Acknowledgment, not worry, was the general tone and optimism on the global outlook positions the Fed nicely coming into year-end with the process of balance sheet normalization set to kick-off in October. If you missed last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed announcement, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest Dot Plot (in yellow) showing how policymakers expect US interest rates to rise over the next few years. As you can see, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a little more dovish about 2018 (as the yellow dots are a little lower than June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grey ones), and rather divided about where rates will be by 2020. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is rallying this morning after the Federal Reserve took the historic step to start unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus package. Investors around the globe are digesting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, which came alongside a commitment to keep raising interest rates if the US economy continues to strengthen. As we live-blogged last night, Fed chair Janet Yellen fired the starting pistol to unwind QE. From October, the central bank will slowly trim its holdings of US government debt, and mortgage-backed bonds. The decision to start normalising the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $4.5 trillion balance sheet is another milestone in the recovery from the worst financial crisis in generations. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe explains: The move, announced after a two-day meeting by Fed officials, will start the gradual reduction of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities, bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The basic message here is that US economic performance has been good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision had been made because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we feel the US economy is performing well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but she added the Fed could reverse course if conditions changed. Yellen also said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mystery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd why inflation hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached target, but the Fed remains confident that it will get there in the end. Markets have reacted by driving the US dollar up against other currencies. The greenback has hit a two-month high against the Japanese yen, at \u00c2\u00a5112.645. It has also driven to a 10 week high against the Indian rupee. The stronger dollar has also sent gold down to a three-week low. Traders now reckon there is a 64% chance that the US Federal Reserve presses on and raises interest rates in December; potentially hurting American borrowers, and pulling capital out of emerging markets and back into US assets. Stock markets, though, seem to be taking the move in their stride... Also coming up today.... 9am: European Central Bank publishes its monthly bulletin. This may contain clues about how the ECB will slow its own stimulus programme 9.30am BST: The latest UK public finances, which will show how much Britain had to borrow to balance the books in August. Economists expect that borrowing hit \u00c2\u00a37bn, up from a small surplus in July. 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures. Has the recent hurricane season hurt the labor market? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching Ryanair, which faces a bruising encounter with shareholders at its AGM in Dublin this morning. The budget airline faces a deepening crisis over its decision to axe up to 50 flights per day, to allow staff to clear a backlog of holiday. We have learned that Ryanair customers face the threat of a fresh wave of flight cancellations as the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pilots prepare to reject an offer of a cash bonus if they give up days off. The Guardian has obtained a draft letter signed by Ryanair pilots from across Europe, rejecting the offer and warning they will now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work to rule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - refusing to work beyond their basic contractual obligations. Ryanair had told pilots earlier this week that if they declined the \u00c2\u00a312,000 payment more flights might have to be scrapped. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story:",

This looks like a fairly hefty step up in the escalation game, and one that is sure to provoke a US response of some kind. Tech stocks were hit hardest, with the Nasdaq already stumbling thanks to the poor debut of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new phone models. North Korea is clearly rattled; the bomber flights at the weekend remind Pyongyang of its inherent vulnerability and its clear disadvantages when it comes to high-tech weaponry. The risks of miscalculation have now multiplied alarmingly, and markets may well continue to respond negatively.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for Europe, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A day relatively free of big corporate news has meant that the focus is squarely on the euro.</p> <p>In Brussels ECB president Mario Draghi seems to have decided that the time has come for a bit of judicious \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctalking down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the euro. While at the most recent ECB meeting he seemed unperturbed by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments show that the rise in the single currency is clearly causing him to lose some sleep. With a nod to inflation weakness, he has suggested reminded everyone not to get too carried away with the idea of tapering, since more easing could still be needed. This is Mr Draghi carefully hedging his bets, but with Germany now somewhat distracted by coalition forming the ECB needs to keep the show on the road. If more QE is the means to achieve this, so be it.</p> </blockquote> <p>So the pound has gained 0.7% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1372.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59c910b0e4b0ff24dc215e55\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T15:24:49.740Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greece nervous after German election outcome</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the German election, and the results have unnerved Greece whose dependency on Berlin for emergency bailout funds has made it ever more vulnerable to developments elsewhere.

Speaking to the European parliament <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/committees/video?event=20170925-1500-COMMITTEE-ECON\">(live here</a>), he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics. As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared. Nevertheless,measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recent months.</p> <p>Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component. Afterwards, it is expected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections.</p> <p>Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialise. Moreover, we still see some uncertainties with respect to the medium-term inflation outlook.</p> <p>Most notably, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.<br></p> <p>We therefore need to be patient and persistent. An upward adjustment of headline inflation that is durable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack. This, in turn, still requires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation. </p> <p>With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments that maintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete its transition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of price stability.</p> </blockquote> <p>He did say the economic was now firm and broad-based across eurozone, while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economic expansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T15:26:42.066Z\">at 4.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59c8b513e4b024b286a9acbe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T13:17:25.030Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German elections: What the experts say.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German general election, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the best City reaction.</strong></p> <p>Asset management firm <strong>BlackRock</strong> say:</p> <ul> <li> Merkel wins a fourth term but faces tricky coalition talks after mainstream parties posted their worst results since the 1940s<br></li> <li>\u00c2\u00b7 We see the outcome slowing momentum behind a Franco-German drive to promote deeper eurozone integration<br></li> <li>\u00c2\u00b7 The powerful position of German finance minister could be key in coalition talks and the future of the eurozone</li> </ul> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook</strong> of<strong> World Firs</strong>t reckons the euro has been weakened by AfD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Critics are wondering what this means for German domestic politics, and the German economy as a whole. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also suspects the new coalition government probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be assembled until December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/912222008410300417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Euro slips as German far right upset the apfel cart - WorldFirst Morning Update September 25th - <a href=\"https://t.co/4WVmFDyuHi\">https://t.co/4WVmFDyuHi</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rksN4Mhrp6\">pic.twitter.com/rksN4Mhrp6</a></p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/912222008410300417\">September 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Nick Peters, </strong>multi asset portfolio manager at<strong> Fidelity International</strong>, said despite the surprises in the German elections, European shares should benefit from a stronger economic backdrop:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity market has lagged other developed markets (excluding the impact of currency) and so offers some potential for catch up, particularly given valuations do not looked stretched relative to recent history and with earnings per share growth the fastest among developed markets.

This should be positive for export orientated sectors, such as industrials and healthcare, though the auto sector faces some stronger specific challenges that will be important for relative performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Kathleen Brooks, </strong>research director at<strong> City Index </strong>believes Spain is more of a threat to the euro than Germany. This weekend Catalonia is proposing to hold a referendum on independence, which the Madrid government had stated is illegal: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Catalonia votes for independence, even if the vote is deemed illegal, then it could put pressure on Madrid to allow the people of the region to have a legal vote, which could increase the chance of a break up of Spain.</p> <p>It could also have ramifications for the EU, would an independent Catalonia be allowed to join? Would it spur other nations to seek independence, not only from other countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but also from the EU?</p> <p> Overall, referendums in recent years have not been good news for a currency. Back in 2014, when Scotland held its unsuccessful independence referendum, the pound dropped 6% from July to September, before bouncing 2% when the referendum failed, then it resumed its downtrend.... Thus, if the Catalonia referendum goes ahead we expect this to be a disruptive event for the euro, with the potential for a sharp decline of up to 5% initially in the single currency if the separatists win. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59c8fb65e4b0ff24dc215ded\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T12:58:24.338Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/25/political-worries-markets-bank-of-england-consumer-credit-business-live?page=with:block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf#block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf\">the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings on consumer credit</a>....</strong></p> <p>....and Capital Economics have issued a note, pointing out that t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/25/political-worries-markets-bank-of-england-consumer-credit-business-live?page=with:block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf#block-59c8bffce4b0ff24dc215ccf\">he BoE isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually forcing banks to tighten their lending</a>.</p> <p>UK economist Ruth Gregory says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Statement, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) fired a warning shot to banks over consumer credit, suggesting that banks would need to increase the amount of capital they hold by \u00c2\u00a310bn in order to protect against losses.

It is a risk to banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to withstand severe economic downturns, because this asset class is disproportionately more likely to default. Although the overall credit quality of consumer credit has improved significantly since the financial crisis, the FPC judges that lenders overall are placing too much weight on the recent performance of consumer lending in benign conditions as an indicator of underlying credit quality. As a result, they have been underestimating the losses they could incur in a downturn. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The FPC has responded to this risk by accelerating its analysis of credit losses that banks could incur in the very deep recession encapsulated in the 2017 annual stress test scenario.</strong> The FPC and PRC judge that, in the first three years of that severe stress test scenario, the UK banking system would, in aggregate, incur UK consumer credit losses of around \u00c2\u00a330 billion, or 20% of UK consumer credit loans, representing 150 basis points of the aggregate common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the UK banking system. This is just one element of the overall stress test and should not be used as a guide to lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overall results, which will be published as planned on 28 November. </li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/912233509263159296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bank of England tells lenders they will need \u00c2\u00a310bn of capital to withstand potential consumer credit losses</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/912233509263159296\">September 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong><em>More to follow....</em></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T08:41:44.071Z\">at 9.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59c8bec6e4b0c2f349fe3d49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-25T08:36:06.036Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/25/political-worries-markets-bank-of-england-consumer-credit-business-live?page=with:block-59c8b8c5e4b0ff24dc215cb4#block-59c8b8c5e4b0ff24dc215cb4\">The fall in business confidence this month</a> is a setback to the German economy, says Carsten Brzeski of ING.</strong></p> <p>He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telling clients that German firms are suffering from rising geopolitical tensions, </p> <p>Brzeski writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While Germany is still digesting the results of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, weakened for the second month in a row and dropped in September.</p> <p>The Ifo index now stands at 115.2, from 115.9 in August.

                "bodyText":"European investors appeared to be a little nervous following the result of the German elections. As expected Angela Merkel remains Chancellor, but the better than expected performance by the far right party AfD took some of the shine off her victory. In the UK banks and insurance shares were under pressure as Labour unveiled proposals to cap interest rate payments on credit cards, while the Bank of England said UK banks need to set aside an extra \u00c2\u00a310bn to cover potential losses on car loans, and credit cards. Meanwhile in the US, a fall in technology stocks Facebook and Apple sent markets lower, as did the comments from North Korea that the US had now declared war on the country. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSe 100 finished down 9.35 points or 0.13% at 7301.29 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.02% to 12,594.81 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.27% lower at 5267.13 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.63% to 22,389.57 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.86% lower at 10,216.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 4.06% to 742.49 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.33%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ratings agency Fitch has opined on the German election result: Crude is at its best level for more than two years after producers said output cuts were having an effect, and fears grew that supplies from Kurdistan could be curtailed. Brent has jumped 2.7% to $58.39 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate added 2% to $51.77. On Friday an Opec meeting said that an agreement to cap production was helping to reduce the global supply glut. Meanwhile Turkey threatened to cut oil flows from Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kurdistan region in response to its referendum on independence, which Turkey does not recognise. With markets slipping back, particularly in the US after the new North Korean comments, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: US stocks underwent a sharp wave of selling as North Korea decided to respond to the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events by declaring that it viewed Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeclaration of war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This looks like a fairly hefty step up in the escalation game, and one that is sure to provoke a US response of some kind. Tech stocks were hit hardest, with the Nasdaq already stumbling thanks to the poor debut of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new phone models. North Korea is clearly rattled; the bomber flights at the weekend remind Pyongyang of its inherent vulnerability and its clear disadvantages when it comes to high-tech weaponry. The risks of miscalculation have now multiplied alarmingly, and markets may well continue to respond negatively. As for Europe, he said: A day relatively free of big corporate news has meant that the focus is squarely on the euro. In Brussels ECB president Mario Draghi seems to have decided that the time has come for a bit of judicious \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctalking down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the euro. While at the most recent ECB meeting he seemed unperturbed by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments show that the rise in the single currency is clearly causing him to lose some sleep. With a nod to inflation weakness, he has suggested reminded everyone not to get too carried away with the idea of tapering, since more easing could still be needed. This is Mr Draghi carefully hedging his bets, but with Germany now somewhat distracted by coalition forming the ECB needs to keep the show on the road. If more QE is the means to achieve this, so be it. So the pound has gained 0.7% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1372. Back with the German election, and the results have unnerved Greece whose dependency on Berlin for emergency bailout funds has made it ever more vulnerable to developments elsewhere. Helena Smith reports: The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was among the first to congratulate the German chancellor Angela Merkel on her four-time electoral victory: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Europe of solidarity and democracy is today more necessary than ever before. Whoever, believes in this, should, despite differences, work together for the deepening and expansion of European values.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More dependent than other EU member states on which way the election went, Greek officials are this morning trying to decode the result. Despite Die Linke, the ruling leftist Syriza party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official choice, posting its second best election result ever, the unexpectedly strong showing of AfD has sent shudders down the spines of many in a country where the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party is the third biggest political force. The strong showing of the bro-business FDP and the strong likelihood of Merkel entering into coalition with the party, is also causing consternation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Christian Linder takes a tough line on debt-stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro zone membership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there was a debt cut for Greece, as the International Monetary Fund suggests, then we should be open-minded to finally solving the problem,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a recent interview with Bloomberg. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece gets a debt cut, the money is gone, but for that Greece has to leave the eurozone, get a new currency of its own which it can devalue and increase its competitiveness in tourism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek politicians worry that Linder will be following up his rhetoric by requesting the post of finance minister in Berlin. Meanwhile Jeroen Dijsselbloem, visiting chairman of the eurogroup ministers represening countries in the single currency, has urged Greece to implement the reforms that will enable it to make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean exit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from its third and current bailout program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a joint interest in getting the third [bailout compliance] review done quickly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said during talks with Tsipras. Back in Europe, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has finished his appearance before parliament. Here is Reuters take on his performance: The European Central Bank is growing increasingly confident that inflation will rise back to its target but patience is still needed, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Monday. Draghi singled out currency volatility as a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring and argued that the economy still needed to absorb slack, requiring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ample\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ECB accommodation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialize,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi told the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committee on economic affairs. With the euro zone economy now growing for the 17th straight quarter, the ECB is expected to reduce stimulus from next year, even if inflation will remain below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near 2 percent target for years to come. Indeed, policymakers speaking to Reuters said that the debate is now about the details of the policy shift, such as whether to keep quantitative easing open ended or whether to signal an intent to phase out bond purchases. US markets have extended their falls after comments from North Korea ratcheted up the tensions with the US again: The Dow is now down 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 is 0.17% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 1%. Gold, as a haven for investors in risky times, has added $2 an ounce to $1299. Elsewhere US markets have slipped at the start of the new week, not helped by a decline in Apple shares on concerns that the new iPhone 8 may not be as popular as hoped and a drop in Facebook stock. The Dow Jones Industrial is down 0.04% in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.12% lower. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are fractionally lower today as the lacklustre move in US equities continues. The American indices registered a string of fresh record-highs recently, but we saw the bullish momentum fizzle out at the end of last week. The ground that has been handed back is small when compared with how much they have risen since August. Federal Reserve member, William Dudley, stated he expects a gradual increase in interest rates. Mr Dudley anticipates inflation to tick up in the medium term, as the soft US dollar and robust international growth will help the US economy. Last week, the US central bank made in clear they intend to hike rates in December. Central banks should be listened to, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always uphold their pledges. Earlier, there was more fuel for the Fed fire with a better than expected manufacturing survey from the Dallas Fed: On the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future actions: Draghi says it is premature to talk about what may be decided at the October meeting of the ECB. That meeting is in the spotlight for any news on the bank deciding tapering its stimulus programme, but Draghi seems keen not to pre-empt the discussion. A question on regulating bitcoin: Asked about North Korea and the current tensions, Draghi says he mentioned potential downside risks for the economy, and geopolitical concerns are part of that. On to questions. Draghi is asked about China and the prospects of its debt situation affecting the global economy. He says he is confident the Chinese monetary authorities can cope adequately and have started to act. And he said it was a different situation to two years ago, when there was a serious concern about a downturn in the Chinese economy. Now the eurozone is stronger and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an unfavourable change in external economic conditions would not have the same negative impact is would have done two years ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi concluded with another call for government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to also take action: While a cyclical adjustment has been taking place, there are still structural issues which impede sustainable economic convergence. In the years to come, a higher degree of sustained convergence and strengthened resilience will be necessary in order to achieve a better-functioning Economic and Monetary Union. This requires, on the one hand, policy actions by national governments aimed at unlocking the productive potential of our economies. On the other hand, further decisive steps are needed to make Economic and Monetary Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic governance truly fit for purpose. Draghi defended the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy and its bond buying programme: The package of monetary policy measures that we have phased in sequentially since June 2014 has led to a significant easing in financing conditions. What is very apparent today, and very difficult to dispute, is that this monetary policy impetus is increasingly leading to stronger economic activity, higher incomes and better employment prospects for people in the euro area. One key factor has been our ability to activate non-standard instruments that can transmit additional stimulus to the productive sector. In fact, transmission through the banking system has become increasingly effective since we began adopting credit-easing measures. I am referring here specifically to the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), but a similar case can be made for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations.... Thanks to our corporate bond purchases, firms in the euro area have witnessed significant improvements in their financing conditions when issuing bonds. The European economy still needs the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package despite its recent recovery, according to the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Mario Draghi, who also expressed concern over the recent volatility of the euro. Speaking to the European parliament (live here), he said: The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics. As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared. Nevertheless,measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recent months. Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component. Afterwards, it is expected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections. Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialise. Moreover, we still see some uncertainties with respect to the medium-term inflation outlook. Most notably, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. We therefore need to be patient and persistent. An upward adjustment of headline inflation that is durable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack. This, in turn, still requires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation. With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments that maintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete its transition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of price stability. He did say the economic was now firm and broad-based across eurozone, while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economic expansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon. Back with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German general election, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the best City reaction. Asset management firm BlackRock say: Merkel wins a fourth term but faces tricky coalition talks after mainstream parties posted their worst results since the 1940s \u00c2\u00b7 We see the outcome slowing momentum behind a Franco-German drive to promote deeper eurozone integration \u00c2\u00b7 The powerful position of German finance minister could be key in coalition talks and the future of the eurozone Jeremy Cook of World First reckons the euro has been weakened by AfD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, saying: Critics are wondering what this means for German domestic politics, and the German economy as a whole. He also suspects the new coalition government probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be assembled until December. Nick Peters, multi asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International, said despite the surprises in the German elections, European shares should benefit from a stronger economic backdrop: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity market has lagged other developed markets (excluding the impact of currency) and so offers some potential for catch up, particularly given valuations do not looked stretched relative to recent history and with earnings per share growth the fastest among developed markets. The backdrop also supports the rationale for small cap eurozone equities which should benefit most from the growing expansion of domestic demand and any agreement to cut corporate taxes. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governments have promoted German growth mainly through external competitiveness and, although there is a need to re-balance the economy somewhat, it is unlikely the new government will significantly change tact with Markel still Chancellor. This should be positive for export orientated sectors, such as industrials and healthcare, though the auto sector faces some stronger specific challenges that will be important for relative performance. And Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index believes Spain is more of a threat to the euro than Germany. This weekend Catalonia is proposing to hold a referendum on independence, which the Madrid government had stated is illegal: If Catalonia votes for independence, even if the vote is deemed illegal, then it could put pressure on Madrid to allow the people of the region to have a legal vote, which could increase the chance of a break up of Spain. It could also have ramifications for the EU, would an independent Catalonia be allowed to join? Would it spur other nations to seek independence, not only from other countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but also from the EU? Overall, referendums in recent years have not been good news for a currency. Back in 2014, when Scotland held its unsuccessful independence referendum, the pound dropped 6% from July to September, before bouncing 2% when the referendum failed, then it resumed its downtrend.... Thus, if the Catalonia referendum goes ahead we expect this to be a disruptive event for the euro, with the potential for a sharp decline of up to 5% initially in the single currency if the separatists win. Back to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings on consumer credit.... ....and Capital Economics have issued a note, pointing out that the BoE isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually forcing banks to tighten their lending. UK economist Ruth Gregory says: In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Statement, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) fired a warning shot to banks over consumer credit, suggesting that banks would need to increase the amount of capital they hold by \u00c2\u00a310bn in order to protect against losses. But it stopped short of attempting to rein in lending.... Overall, then, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action goes further than the red-flag waving we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen from the FPC up until now. But it is unlikely to slow the economy significantly, or delay the first hike in interest rates, which we think will be in November. Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apology (see earlier post) appears to have broken the ice with London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorities. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has just welcomed Dara Khosrowshahi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open letter -- and asked Transport for London to meet with the Uber boss. Khan says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I welcome the apology from Dara Khosrowshahi, the Uber CEO. Obviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London. Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Nick Hopkins has a cracking scoop - Deloitte, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest accountancy firms, has recently been hacked, exposing emails from some its major clients. Nick writes: One of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big four\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd accountancy firms has been targeted by a sophisticated hack that compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, the Guardian can reveal. Deloitte, which is registered in London and has its global headquarters in New York, was the victim of a cybersecurity attack that went unnoticed for months. One of the largest private firms in the US, which reported a record $37bn (\u00c2\u00a327.3bn) revenue last year, Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and high-end cybersecurity advice to some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies. The Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The companies include household names as well as US government departments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Shares in UK banks and insurers have dropped this morning, amid the warning that a recession could create \u00c2\u00a330bn of consumer credit losses. Virgin Money has shed almost 2%, Barclays are down 1% and Prudential have lost 1.5%, as traders digest this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the Bank of England. Jasper Lawler, LCG Head of Research, explains: A downturn in bank and insurance company shares meant a difficult start to the week for the FTSE 100. The Bank of England is sounding the alarm on rising consumer debt levels. Any restriction on lending, particularly unsecured lending like credit cards and car loans would be a direct hit to a big profit centre for banks and insurers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, Labour are calling on the UK government to change the law so that credit card customers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay more in interest repayments than their original loan (as flagged up at 10.30am). And if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, John McDonnell says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it when Labour win power. John McDonnell just brought the Labour conference hall to its collective feet, with a pledge to bring Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy, water, rail, and the Royal Mail back into public ownership and control. No immediate reaction on the stock market, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye.... Over at the Labour party conference in Brighton, shadow chancellor John McDonnell is criticising Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rentier economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. McDonnell is also blasting the City for failing to support high value businesses, and promising a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strategic Investment Board\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to improve productivity. Plus, extra investment on transport links outside London. Our Politics liveblog has full details: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about consumer credit comes as the City braces for the first UK interest rate rise since 2007. The BoE is widely expected to hike borrowing costs by early next year, quite possibly in at its November meeting. Millions of home owners and borrowers have never seen interest rates go up, thus the concern that the rapid growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer credit could end in tears. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish stance has already hurt speculative investors, such as hedge funds. They have been forced to ditch their bets that the pound would weaken, since the BoE hinted earlier this month that a rate rise was close. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever has tweeted the details: Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apologetic open letter to London strikes a more conciliatory tone. His promise to change the taxi hire company is a clear sign that Uber could compromise to persuade TfL to reverse last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, and let it keep operating in the capital. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equally true that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, Iapologise for the mistakes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made. We will appeal the decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, Uber has issued an open letter confirming it will appeal the decision to remove its licence to operate in London. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has apologised for the mistakes made by Uber (he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specify what, exactly) and promised to listen to its critics. Khosrowshahi has also thanked the hundreds of thousands of people who signed a petition urging Transport for London to reverse the move (which has split opinion in the media and on the streets of the capital). Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications chief, Alex Belardinelli, has tweeted the letter: TfL ruled last Friday that Uber was not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd private car hire operator, citing concerns over its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and checking the background of its drivers. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, has sent over some tips for consumers to protect themselves from getting overwhelmed by debt. Borrowing as little as possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and only ever for a specific reason Checking your credit report is correct before you apply Finding the cheapest way to get the cash you need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this could be a 0% credit card or a low cost loan If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a credit card go to a comparison site to check your chance of acceptance upfront so you can apply with confidence Being clear about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affordable for you now as well as if your circumstances change Always having a plan to pay back what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve borrowed upfront Treating credit card borrowing like a loan and setting up regular payments to clear it. She addsL \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee statement means more for banks than it does for borrowers right now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest financial power telling lenders they need to be careful and set aside an extra \u00c2\u00a310bn if they want to sail through Brexit unscathed. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer credit warning comes as the opposition Labour party turn up the pressure on lenders. Later today, shadow chancellor John McDonnell is expected to promise more help for people struggling with their debts. Under Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals, debt repayments would be capped at twice the original borrowings (similar to existing protection for payday loans). McDonnell is expected to tell the Labour party conference that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means that no one will ever pay more in interest than their original loan. If the Tories refuse to act, I can announce today that the next Labour government will amend the law.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our City editor Jill Treanor has studied today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, and reports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks could incur \u00c2\u00a330bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance if interest rates and unemployment rise sharply, the Bank of England warned on Monday. After assessing the fast growth in the consumer credit market, Threadneedle Street is requiring the banking system to hold an extra \u00c2\u00a310bn of capital as protection against any future losses after finding that lenders are underestimating their exposure to bad debts in an economic downturn. Publishing its latest assessment of risks to the financial system, the Bank of England also spelt out specific concerns about the impact of Brexit on \u00c2\u00a320tn of derivatives contracts used by companies and financial firms to manage their risks. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU also raises questions about whether banks will able to hold consumer data in Britain and poses questions about the ability of insurance companies to make payments to consumers across the union. The Bank of England says that UK consumer credit is growing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrapidly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at 9.8% in the 12 months to July 2017. It singles out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong growth of dealership car finance, credit card debt and other borrowing, such as personal loans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, shows how car finance has swelled in recent years. This is mainly due to the boom in personal contract purchase deals, which let a consumer pay a small regular payment for a new car and then either buy it or walk away after a few years. Last week, my colleague Richard Partington explained how PCPs are encouraging people into debt. He wrote: There is no suggestion the sales practices are illegal or that any rules have been broken, yet they illustrate a significant shift in the way cars are bought in the UK. Salespeople at three dealerships visited by the Guardian offered vehicles on the road with little or no deposit. One suggested a \u00c2\u00a31,000 downpayment to secure a 1.5l Mini Cooper, with a top speed of 127mph, which could be refunded when the car was collected from the showroom a few days later. Deposits can even be paid for by credit card, adding to the debt pile...... Britons previously paid cash or took out a loan from a high street bank. Now, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re increasingly turning to finance packages, with a package known as the personal contract purchase (PCP) among the most popular. One salesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most people come in here and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAh, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And then they tend to walk out with a PCP agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England seems to have turned up the volume today: As City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Jolly puts it: The Bank of England today issued its strongest warning yet on the fast-expanding consumer credit sector, with financial stability experts at Threadneedle Street saying banks may not be adequately prepared for losses. In a nutshell, the Bank of England is concerned that lenders, both in the UK and beyond, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being prudent enough. It fears that reckless borrowing will come back and bite banks, painfully, if the world economy weakens, financial conditions worsen, and borrowers find they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve overstretched themselves. As the FPC puts it: There are signs in some markets, globally and domestically, of excessive weight being placed on recent benign conditions as an indicator of future risks. This behaviour encourages greater risk taking, potentially building up greater vulnerabilities. The FPC singles out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pronounced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd financial vulnerabilities in China, where corporate borrowing has outpaced economic growth, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corporate leverage in the United States\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Bank of England is also concerned that Brexit poses a risk to UK economic stability. It ha singled out the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge market in derivative contracts (such as options to buy or sell financial assets at a certain price in the future. The Financial Policy Committee says: The FPC is considering in particular risks arising from: discontinuity of cross-border contracts, in particular insurance and derivatives; restrictions on sharing of personal data between the European Union and United Kingdom; and restrictions after Brexit on cross-border banking, central clearing and asset management service provision. Newsflash: The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning that consumer credit losses could spiral if the economy weakens. The BoE says UK banks need to set aside an extra \u00c2\u00a310bn to cover potential losses on car loans, and credit cards. The warning comes from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, which has just published the conclusions from its latest meeting, last week. In it, the FPC warns that consumer credit looses could hit \u00c2\u00a330bn (!) if Britain falls into a recession. It reckons that one in five consumer credit loans might have to be written off..... The report says: Within a benign overall domestic credit environment, there is a pocket of risk in the rapid growth of consumer credit. This is not a material risk to economic growth, as consumer credit represents only 11% of overall household debt. It is a risk to banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to withstand severe economic downturns, because this asset class is disproportionately more likely to default. Although the overall credit quality of consumer credit has improved significantly since the financial crisis, the FPC judges that lenders overall are placing too much weight on the recent performance of consumer lending in benign conditions as an indicator of underlying credit quality. As a result, they have been underestimating the losses they could incur in a downturn. The FPC has responded to this risk by accelerating its analysis of credit losses that banks could incur in the very deep recession encapsulated in the 2017 annual stress test scenario. The FPC and PRC judge that, in the first three years of that severe stress test scenario, the UK banking system would, in aggregate, incur UK consumer credit losses of around \u00c2\u00a330 billion, or 20% of UK consumer credit loans, representing 150 basis points of the aggregate common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the UK banking system. This is just one element of the overall stress test and should not be used as a guide to lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overall results, which will be published as planned on 28 November. More to follow.... The fall in business confidence this month is a setback to the German economy, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telling clients that German firms are suffering from rising geopolitical tensions, Brzeski writes: While Germany is still digesting the results of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, weakened for the second month in a row and dropped in September. The Ifo index now stands at 115.2, from 115.9 in August. Both the expectations and current assessment component dropped. While the September drop was probably a result of increased geopolitical tensions, ongoing problems in the German automotive industry and the stronger euro, the next months will tell how the German business sector looks at the results of Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll. The drop in German business confidence suggests that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is slowing, says IFO. IFO also reckons that a second German election is possible.... Just in: German business confidence has deteriorated unexpectedly this month. The monthly survey of investor morale, from the IFO institute, has dropped to 115.2 from 115.9. Investors had expected it to maintain its recent rally and hit 116.0. IFO found that German firms are less optimistic about current business conditions, and their future prospects. But still, the IFO index is at a pretty solid level: Mehreen Khan of the Financial Times also reckons the German election results are a blow to Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for a eurozone budget. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snapshot from her Brussels Briefing: She warns that it could take months to hammer out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jamaica\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coalition. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets have all dipped in early trading. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says political concerns are weighing on the markets: The negative European open follow a mixed session in Asia in response to a less convincing Federal election win for German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron struggling in Senate elections - both denting the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coupled with a UK sovereign debt downgrade by Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Friday, just hours after PM May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit speech, and aggressive rhetoric from North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister at the UN on Saturday. The pound is shaking off Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to downgrade Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating last Friday night. Sterling has risen by almost half a cent against the US dollar at $1.3533, despite Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium-term economic strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be weakened by Brexit - a claim the Treasury have rebutted. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale suggests Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are playing catch-up (any serious trader will have their own views on Brexit too): Beware a short-lived slide, but the longer-term depends on the economy, monetary policy the public finances and all that normal jazz. Ratings agencies can have a temporary impact but they are mostly telling us what we already know and have priced-in long ago. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reaction in the bond market either: Investors are piling into German government debt this morning, at the expense of riskier assets such as Italian bonds. This has pushed the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs to its highest level since early September: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve collected the full German election results here. The euro is losing ground in early trading, as traders digest Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results. The single currency has shed 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.1915. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suffering a sharper fall against the pound, down 0.7% at 87.9p. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at Interactive Investor, says investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the sound of lengthy coalition talks between German parties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As predicted, Angela Merkel won a fourth term in office, but not without handing over a chunk of her vote to the Far Right AFD. The SDP did even worse, and the chancellor will be forced into bed with the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP) in a Jamaica coalition. Any extended period of uncertainty poses a problem, certainly if the FDP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dislike of Macron threatens Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with France. Markets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that Angela Merkel becomes distracted from international politics during the inevitable horse trading following a disappointing election for her. Any sense that this weakens the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position could play into the hands of UK Brexit negotiators, as a fourth round of talks with European officials begins in Brussels today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a risk-off feel in the markets this morning after a weekend of political drama, notably in Germany. Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s achievement in winning fourth term as German chancellor is firmly overshadowed by the news that the far-right, anti-immigration AfD party has won seats in the Bundestag. AfD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock success has serious implications for Europe and the eurozone. It could force Merkel to take a tougher line on migration, and probably also undermines French president Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes to create more European integration. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely coalition partners, the FDP, are firmly opposed to the idea of a eurozone budget in which Germany covers some of its neighbours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bills. Germany wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only country heading to the polls last weekend. New Zealand also held a general election, which has delivered a stalemate with neither major party securing a majority. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, says: Politics continues to make its mark on markets after the weekend provided news of two more coalition governments. Angela Merkel underperformed expectations of an easy victory and was awarded with the parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lowest vote count since 1949, whilst New Zealand is now bracing itself for a fourth consecutive coalition government. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming victory may have seen her cling on to a 4th term, but her job has just become harder. The rise of AFD, which celebrated its highest result of 13.5%, means they have a louder voice and will force Germany to confront anti-immigration and anti-EU issues at home. Rumours that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Shinzo Abe might call a snap general election is also keeping traders on their toes. Plus, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Trump factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president spent the weekend extending his controversial travel ban, and attacking NFL football players as the US anthem row deepened. The City would rather see some progress on infrastructure spending and tax reforms. So, Asian markets have mostly fallen overnight. Europe is following suit with the FTSE 100 losing 35 points in early trading. Also coming up today..... Consumer debt will also be under the spotlight, with the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to disclose details of its review into credit. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee is concerned that some lender are being too reckless. Tim Wallace of the Daily Telegraph has a good take: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks are braced for new restrictions on consumer lending as the Bank of England prepares to unveil the results of its review of the booming sector. Credit cards, unsecured loans and car finance deals have all surged in popularity over the past year, leading Mark Carney and his colleagues on the powerful Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to investigate if there are any growing risks in the sector. The Bank is today expected to provide an indication of its analysis of consumer credit risks across the sector.

But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things, the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and other factors. As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. Moving too quickly risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass. A gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock.</p> <p>But we should also be wary of moving <em>too</em> gradually. Job gains continue to run well ahead of the longer-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to overcome without triggering a recession. Persistently easy monetary policy might also eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications for financial stability. For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca858ae4b021792a4faa4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:53:05.334Z\">5.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting, Yellen admitted the central bank did not really understand why inflation had not returned to target. In <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170926a.htm\">her Ohio speech</a>, she says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Key among current uncertainties are the forces driving inflation, which has remained low in recent years despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions. ...This low inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time. But .. many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation could prove to be unexpectedly persistent.</p> <p>My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation. In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price stability.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:53:26.191Z\">at 5.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59ca8531e4b021792a4faa48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:50:21.707Z\">5.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have pushed the US dollar index to its highest level since August 31, as investors bet another rise is coming.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca8469e4b0a816872ae44f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:46:48.235Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech can be seen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/912718067595186176\">here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca831fe4b0a816872ae448\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:44:58.776Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen hints at further US rate rises</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has hinted at further rate rises, prompting renewed suggestions a December move is on the cards.</p> <p>Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting seemed to indicate as much, and in a speech in Ohio Yellen said it would be imprudent to leave rates on hold until inflation reached 2%.

While the Bank of Japan will pick up the slack, a growing number of other central banks are turning or have already turned hawkish.

But the oil market has become better balanced over the past year, suggesting that prices should remain fairly stable...</p> <p>There are several reasons for the recent rise in prices. Most significantly, the underlying demand and supply for oil have been coming into balance over the past year or so. There has been a steady increase in demand as global growth has picked up. And the increase in supply has been constrained by the OPEC-led production cuts, for which compliance has continued to be surprisingly good.</p> <p>More recently, leading OPEC members have hinted that they may extend their production cuts of 1.8 million bpd beyond March 2018. This in turn is partly a response to oil stocks not dropping back as rapidly as OPEC members had hoped, due to a surge in oil production by Nigeria, Libya and the US. </p> <p>And prices jumped in the past day or so due to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unofficial referendum on independence in the Kurdish region of Iraq and Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to close the pipeline for Kurdish oil exports. Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kurdish region produces around 650,000 bpd, the bulk of which goes through Turkey. </p> <p>We suspect that the latest surge in oil prices marks the end of an upward trend. Admittedly, some kind of deal to extend the OPEC cuts is now likely, but it is not a done deal as there are several obstacles to be overcome...And Turkey is unlikely to block Kurdish oil exports unless tensions in the region escalate dramatically. </p> <p>Looking further ahead, it seems likely that oil prices will be fairly stable in the coming years. Not only are global demand and supply now better balanced, but several \u00e2\u20ac\u0153automatic stabilisers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should take effect. A significant increase in prices would lead to higher shale production and weaker OPEC compliance, and a significant decrease may well prompt OPEC to reinforce its agreement to restrict supply. Our forecast remains for Brent crude to end this year and next at $57pb and $55pb respectively. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca5588e4b0ff24dc216345\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T13:31:31.683Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US, the boss of credit reporting agency Equifax is leaving after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/equifax-credit-firm-march-breach-massive-may-hack-customers\">a data breach which exposed personal data of 143m Americans.</a></p> <p>Richard Smith is stepping down as chief executive after 12 years in the top job.

                "bodyText":"And here is the sign-off in Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: To conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook that, with gradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will stabilize at around the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening in labor market conditions. But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things, the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and other factors. As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here are Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quotes on the pace of interest rate changes: How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. Moving too quickly risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass. A gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock. But we should also be wary of moving too gradually. Job gains continue to run well ahead of the longer-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to overcome without triggering a recession. Persistently easy monetary policy might also eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications for financial stability. For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting, Yellen admitted the central bank did not really understand why inflation had not returned to target. In her Ohio speech, she says: Key among current uncertainties are the forces driving inflation, which has remained low in recent years despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions. ...This low inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time. But .. many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation could prove to be unexpectedly persistent. My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation. In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price stability. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have pushed the US dollar index to its highest level since August 31, as investors bet another rise is coming. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech can be seen here. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has hinted at further rate rises, prompting renewed suggestions a December move is on the cards. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting seemed to indicate as much, and in a speech in Ohio Yellen said it would be imprudent to leave rates on hold until inflation reached 2%. But she added that the current uncertainties strengthened the case for gradual rate rises, although the Fed had to be careful not to move too gradually. The risk of a stock market fall seems to be growing, reckons Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off, Wall Street opened sharply higher as downbeat tech names found support on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bargain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hunting and amid short-side profit-taking. However, the gains appeared to be short-lived as at the time of this writing, the major indices were coming off their best levels again. I still think a major correction could be on the cards soon, possibly in the coming days. With US stock markets holding near their all-time highs and volatility being suppressed to record low levels, I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but feel investors are becoming unjustifiably complacent. Valuations have already become overstretched and at some point even the most bullish of market participants will have to accept that. A growing number of analysts agree that the bullish run cannot continue rising at this pace for much longer, at least without a sizeable correction of some sort. One also has to remember that the number one reason why stocks are where they are is because of the unprecedented era of cheap central bank money flooding the financial markets. But with the Federal Reserve set to normalise its balance sheet, monetary conditions are going to tighten in the US. While the Bank of Japan will pick up the slack, a growing number of other central banks are turning or have already turned hawkish. The Bank of Canada has already started raising interest rates, while the Bank of England is set to do so in the coming months. The European Central Bank will likely announce the start of its own QE tapering soon. Investors remained cautious, in the wake of the continuing tensions between the US and North Korea and the outcome of the German election. So European markets ended the day little moved, while in the US, Wall Street lost some of its early gains but so far has remained in positive territory. The dollar recovered but the euro remained weak, while oil slipped back from its 26 month highs as profit takers moved in. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 15.55 points or 0.21% at 7285.74 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.08% to 12,605.20 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.03% to 5268.76 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.18% better at 22,430.65 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.26% at 10,189.6 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% to 740.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 9 points or 0.04%. The pound remains ahead against the euro but lower against the dollar. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The euro continued to hog the limelight this Tuesday, as investors chew over the various German, French and Spanish issues facing the Eurozone. Down half a percent against the dollar, the euro is now sitting at a fresh month low of around $1.178. Against sterling it is doing a tiny bit better; though the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at an effective 2 month low, it has halved its losses to 0.2%, forcing the pound back below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because sterling has been softened up by former MPC member David Blanchflower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning [in the Guardian] that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabsolutely no basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a rate hike in November, a comment that also dragged cable lower by 0.4% fall. All this was further complicated by the hawkish signals sent out by New York Fed President William Dudley, who claimed the rate hike obstacles facing the Fed are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122... Still to come this Tuesday is a speech from Janet Yellen, tantalisingly titled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInflation, Uncertainty and Monetary Policy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potentially attention-grabbing stuff for investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if these kinds of talks can end up providing less insight than hoped for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the dollar looking to extend today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains with a few juicy hawkish morsels. Oil prices have fallen from their highs after profit takers moved in. Brent crude had risen to more than $59 a barrel, its highest level since July 2015, on a combination of growing demand, Opec production cuts and Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to shut the pipeline that runs from Northern Iraq through Turkey to the port of Ceyhan. But it has slipped back just over 1% to $58.39 as investors decided to cash in some of their gains. American consumers were less confident in September than the previous month, partly due to the impact of the recent hurricanes. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index came in at 119.8 this month, below the expected level of 120. It was also below August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 120.4, itself revised down from 122.9. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the board, said: Consumer confidence decreased slightly in September after a marginal improvement in August. Confidence in Texas and Florida, however, decreased considerably, as these two states were the most severely impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Despite the slight downtick in confidence, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions remains quite favorable and their expectations for the short-term suggest the economy will continue expanding at its current pace. US markets have moved ahead at the start of trading, as technology stocks recovered from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. But investors remained nervous amid the continuing tensions between North Korea and the US. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 50 points or 0.23% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.37%. Back with oil, and the latest surge may not continued but the market may now be better balanced, says Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics: The latest rise in oil prices reflects concerns about Kurdish supply and hopes for another extension of OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cuts, neither of which may have a lasting influence on prices. But the oil market has become better balanced over the past year, suggesting that prices should remain fairly stable... There are several reasons for the recent rise in prices. Most significantly, the underlying demand and supply for oil have been coming into balance over the past year or so. There has been a steady increase in demand as global growth has picked up. And the increase in supply has been constrained by the OPEC-led production cuts, for which compliance has continued to be surprisingly good. More recently, leading OPEC members have hinted that they may extend their production cuts of 1.8 million bpd beyond March 2018. This in turn is partly a response to oil stocks not dropping back as rapidly as OPEC members had hoped, due to a surge in oil production by Nigeria, Libya and the US. And prices jumped in the past day or so due to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unofficial referendum on independence in the Kurdish region of Iraq and Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to close the pipeline for Kurdish oil exports. Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kurdish region produces around 650,000 bpd, the bulk of which goes through Turkey. We suspect that the latest surge in oil prices marks the end of an upward trend. Admittedly, some kind of deal to extend the OPEC cuts is now likely, but it is not a done deal as there are several obstacles to be overcome...And Turkey is unlikely to block Kurdish oil exports unless tensions in the region escalate dramatically. Looking further ahead, it seems likely that oil prices will be fairly stable in the coming years. Not only are global demand and supply now better balanced, but several \u00e2\u20ac\u0153automatic stabilisers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should take effect. A significant increase in prices would lead to higher shale production and weaker OPEC compliance, and a significant decrease may well prompt OPEC to reinforce its agreement to restrict supply. Our forecast remains for Brent crude to end this year and next at $57pb and $55pb respectively. Over in the US, the boss of credit reporting agency Equifax is leaving after a data breach which exposed personal data of 143m Americans. Richard Smith is stepping down as chief executive after 12 years in the top job. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management had come under fire for lax security and its response to the hacking, which took place in May. Over in Greece, bank shares have suffered an alarming plunge, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Shares have been sliding since the IMF announced that it wanted to conduct a bank asset review as part of a third bailout compliance review with Greece. The prospect of multiple stress tests would further highlight Greek lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 huge non-performing loan problem. This fear was reinforced yesterday when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi hinted that the Single Supervisory Mechanism may front-load stress tests for Greek banks, once again raising the prospect that banks would need more capital. Shares have fallen further on news that banks will float fresh plans to reduce NPLs early next month. Shares in Alpha Bank, Attica Bank and Piraeus Bank have all tumbled by at least 10%, while National Bank of Greece has lost over 6%. The spectre of shrinkflation is stalking through the UK economy again today - and this time Jaffa Cakes are the victims. Manufacturer McVities is facing a revolt after reducing the number of Jaffa Cakes in each pack from 12 to just 10. Fans of the orange-centred snack are outraged..... McVities are trying to calm the storm (which the BBC have seen fit to dub \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJaffa Quake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122...), insisting that wholesale prices have also been cut. A spokesperson also insists that the firm haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done a Toblerone and messed around with the sizing, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no change in the size, shape or weight of individual cakes in the McVitie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jaffa Cake range.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, there are reports that some shops are selling the new downsized Jaffa Cakes at the old price! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into the biggest Jaffa Cake row since the British taxman tried to prove they were actually biscuits. The drop in the pound has driven up the cost of sugar, chocolate and flour for UK producers, so this may not be the last example of shrinkflation. Still, Jaffa Cake fans who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with less than a dozen in one sitting could always make their own... The Unite union is urging the UK government to raise its efforts to protect jobs at Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Belfast factory. Assistant general secretary Tony Burke says Bombardier workers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holding their breath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling on the trade dispute with Boeing. Burke adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister and the government need to make it clear to Trump they will not stand back and watch our members jobs and our communities threatened like this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mrs May needs to stand up for our members in the aerospace industry and for decent jobs and for manufacturing in the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire is currently meeting the Unite union in Belfast to hear their fears over a legal ruling in the United States that could put thousands of jobs in peril at the Bombardier aerospace factory in the east of the city. Unite and the 4,000 plus workforce at the East Belfast plant are waiting anxiously for news on a ruling in the United States over claims by rival plane-maker Boeing that Bombardier received anti-competitive state support in Canada. Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal action, which the US Department of Commerce and US International Trade Commission will adjudicate on later on Tuesday, relates to Bombardier winning a contract to make the wings for Delta Airlines C-Series aircraft. The wings are constructed in Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Belfast base. Unite told The Guardian the union will remind Secretary of State Brokenshire that the UK government has extensive contracts with Boeing in particular for purchasing military aircraft from the American aerospace giant. The union wants the Cabinet in London to apply greater pressure on Boeing to end its legal action against its rival. Boeing has argued that a \u00c2\u00a3750 million support grant to Bombardier from the Quebec regional government in Canada two years ago that rescued the company from bankruptcy breaks US anti-competition laws and is tantamount to illegal state support for their rival. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Brexit dashboard has just been launched, showing how the UK economy is faring since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. This month, the dashboard shows that the pound has recovered to its highest levels since the vote, but that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped inflation hitting four-year highs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: So with real wages still falling, former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower argues that this is no time to raise borrowing costs. The euro has fallen sharply this week against the Swiss franc, as well as the US dollar and the pound. Piotr Bujak, chief economist at PKO Bank Polski, has tweeted the details: The euro is also suffering from jitters ahead of Catalan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence referendum. The Catalan government plans to hold a referendum on whether to break away from Spain on Sunday, despite opposition from Spanish authorities. Madrid is trying to prevent the vote by confiscating millions of ballot papers, after the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional court declared the referendum illegal. Last week, at least 12 people were arrested when police raided Catalan government offices. The situation is threatening to escalate further; on Monday, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general refused to rule out the possibility of arresting the Catalan president himself. The Catalan and Kurdish votes are a double-dose of worry for the markets, as Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains: The impending Catalonian referendum is certainly a fear for many within the EU, with the result providing the potential for ongoing conflict in the region. Referendums are clearly a major market driver at the moment, with the Iraqi Kurdistan vote being a potential disruption to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil supply. As President Erdogan threatens to cut off the Kurdistan oil pipelines, it comes as no surprise that we have seen another leg higher for Brent, which hit a two-year high yesterday. The pound has hit a 10-week high against the euro, as worries over the German election continue to drag the single currency down. Sterling has risen by 0.3% this morning to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14 for the first time since 14 July. This may annoy British holidaymakers who swapped pounds for euros in the summer holidays, as the pound fell during August to just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.08, an eight year low. The euro has also dipped against the US dollar, to a one-month low of $1.1822, extending Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Investors are selling the euro because they expect it will take Angela Merkel many weeks to hammer out a new coalition (most likely with the Free Democrats and the Greens). The success of the far-right AfD party is also a concern, as it may restrain Merkel from driving closer eurozone integration. Ian Ormiston, manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, reckons Merkel has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153diminished\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, despite winning a fourth term as chancellor: We will have protracted coalition talks as the socialist SPD party have indicated that they wish to lead the opposition and so the most likely grouping is centre right CDU/CSU, pro-business FDP and left-leaning Gr\u00c3\u00bcne (Green) party. This is likely to bring minor policy shifts at home, and more importantly, slow the momentum towards greater European integration which was building following Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election as president of France. This will disappoint those that wanted European rebalancing led by more expansionary German fiscal policy and those that hope for an expansion of European structures to cope with the next crisis. For equity markets, we can probably look for more of the same, modest but adequate growth across the region and political pragmatism having little impact on earnings and valuations. In contrast, the pound is still benefitting from the prospect of a UK interest rate rise soon, perhaps at the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting in early November. Just in: Britons took a break from hammering their credit cards last month, and dipped into their savings instead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to new industry data from UK Finance, which suggests households are being squeezed hard by inflation and low wage growth. The figures show that annual growth in personal deposits with high street banks fell to 2.2% in August, in the weakest month since May 2009. Consumer borrowing from High Street banks slowed to 1.5% in August, down from 1.9% in July. Our economics correspondent Richard Partington explains: The trade body suggested consumers are saving a bit less each month, as opposed to borrowing more, amid a modest decline in the growth of credit card and personal loans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems households are saving a bit less each month, rather than borrowing more, as growth in personal deposits has slowed recently, alongside a slowdown in growth of consumer credit borrowing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. Annual growth in credit card borrowing was 5% in August, compared to 5.3% in the previous month, while the use of personal loans and overdrafts fell by 1.6% on an annual basis, from a contraction of 1% in the year to July. The figures may show that recent warnings from the Bank of England against reckless lending have reached lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ears. But the drop in savings growth highlights that households may be ill-prepared for an economic downturn. UK Finance also reported that 41,807 mortgages were approved in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than the monthly average of 41,133 over the last six months, despite a drop in buy-to-let loans following recent tax changes. UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Senior Economist Mohammad Jamei said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Housing market activity is in Goldilocks territory, growing only modestly since the start of the year, though the mix of activity has shifted towards first-time buyers, away from buy-to-let and cash. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not reached $60 per oil quite yet. Instead, Brent crude price are dipping a little.... European stock markets are subdued this morning, after the US and North Korea escalated their war of words last night. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down around 0.2%, despite a rally among oil producers. North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153declared war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has unnerved some investors, and sent shares down on Wall Street last night. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets say: This has perked up safe haven demand for Gold, bonds, the Yen and Swiss Franc, although relative calm among risk assets suggests many expect the move to again be short-lived. However, the rally in Oil prices is helping buoy sentiment thanks to a Kurdish referendum that could threaten Iraqi exports, extending a summer Oil rebound. Energy trading group Trafigura believes the worst is over for the oil market. Ben Luckock, its co-head of Group Market Risk, told a conference this morning that the era of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower for longer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd oil prices would soon be over. Luckock argued that rising demand, and tighter supply, would keep prices up. However...there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that once prices go up, more supply comes onto the market - particularly from US shale producers. So we shall see.... Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kurdish independence referendum took place without the support of the Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government in Baghdad. But that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent widespread celebrations on the streets of Erbil, capital city of Kurdistan region in Iraq, last night as the polls closed. People chanted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bye bye Iraq! Bye bye Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, set off fireworks and took to the streets in cars festooned with Kurdish flags. There are more than 30 million Kurds, living in Iraq, Syria, Iran and Turkey. So, last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum has been criticised by Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbours, who fear that their own Kurdish populations will also push harder for their own state. Turkey has a large Kurdish population, and its military forces have been clashing with the militant PKK group, which demands Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, for many years (Ankara insists that the PKK are a terrorist operation, but its leader was recently seen being protected by US soldiers, as his troops fight against ISIS.....) Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an fears that the Kurdish referendum will encourage his own Kurdish population to push for independence. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatening to take economic, trade and security counter-measures, including possibly shutting the pipeline that runs from Northern Iraq through Turkey to the port of Ceyhan. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said yesterday that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After this, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see through which channels the northern Iraqi regional government will send its oil, or where it will sell it. We have the tap. The moment we close the tap, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fercan Yalinkilic has tweeted a handy chart showing how the path of the pipeline: A former Saudi energy ministry official has predicted that the oil price will soon hit $60 per barrel. Ibrahim al-Muhanna told an audience in Washington last night that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to restrict supplies will keep prices rising. Al-Munhanna, who recently retired as an advisor to the Saudi Energy Ministry, argued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the current arrangement and commitment of major producers, and their willingness to adjust and extend the agreement, I believe as commercial oil stocks continue to contract, oil prices will gradually increase. We even might hit $60 per barrel before the end of this year or the beginning of next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Signs that Opec members are enforcing their recent deal to cut production have also helped to drive the oil price up. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, explains: Oil prices have been going higher in recent weeks due first and foremost to evidence that OPEC and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to reduce the global supply glut was showing positive results and that the group was somewhat surprisingly sticking to their agreement. Indeed, according to the OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, the cartel and its partners had implemented more than 100% of their agreed cuts in August. Talks that the production cuts could be extended has been providing further confidence to oil investors that the rally could be sustained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Motorists face the prospect of higher prices at the pump after the price of oil hit its highest level in over two years. Brent crude has jumped over $59 per barrel, its highest level since July 2015, as concern grows over potential supply problems. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan sparked the rally, after threatening to cut off a pipeline that carries oil from northern Iraq to the outside world. Erdogan is deeply unhappy that the Kurdistan Regional Government held a referendum on independence yesterday, as part of their drive to break away from the rest of Iraq. That pipeline, which runs from Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oilfields to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, usually pumps between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels per day (Reuters reports), so any disruption could have a significant effect on the market. Oil has already been rising, as US refineries have been hit by the hurricane season - Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats have given it another lift, putting Brent crude within sight of the $60 per barrel mark. US crude oil is also up, at $52 per barrel. Central bankers will be watching closely, as energy prices have a significant impact on inflation. A higher oil price could easily drive Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living yet higher, intensifying pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says: The standout trend in markets right now is oil, moving higher pretty steadily.... All of this makes OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life a little bit easier, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also significant at a wider level. Elsewhere in the markets, traders will be poised for developments following Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, as Angela Merkel tries to form a new coalition government. The euro has a bad day yesterday, after the far-right AfD party won seats, as Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever shows: On the corporate side, aerospace firm Bombardier will discover if it will suffer financial penalties over a trade dispute with its rival Boeing. Bombardier is accused of selling its C-Series airliners at artificially low prices. The wings for the plane are made in Northern Ireland, so the US trade court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial ruling could affect thousands of jobs. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching out for new housing figures from Britain and America through the day.... The agenda 9.30am BST: The British Bankers Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of UK mortgage approvals. 2pm BST: S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of US house prices. 3pm BST: US consumer confidence and home sales figures 5.45pm BST: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gives a speech on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

According to the GMB union it supports nearly 10,000 further jobs through its suppliers. </p> \n  <h2>What is the Government doing about it? </h2> \n  <p>Political powersharing at Stormont has been in cold storage for months. However the DUP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 anti-Brexit MPs are a crucial force propping up the Government in key votes after Theresa May lost her majority in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s General Election. </p> \n  <p>DUP leader Arlene Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence has seen the Prime Minister lobbying US President Donald Trump during a recent visit to New York. </p> \n  <p>Following the DoC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement the UK Government said it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to strongly defend UK interests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and labelled Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unjustified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-59cb6580e4b021792a4fad92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-27T08:55:59.251Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More from Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadows secretary of state for Northern Ireland:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OwenSmith_MP/status/912960933273767936\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why did Theresa May refuse to echo Justin Trudeau's promise to cuts contracts with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Boeing?src=hash\">#Boeing</a> if they pursued action against <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bombardier?src=hash\">#Bombardier</a> ?</p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Owen Smith (@OwenSmith_MP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OwenSmith_MP/status/912960933273767936\">September 27, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OwenSmith_MP/status/912961591515152384\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Bombardier crisis also shows why we need an executive back in Belfast.

                "bodyText":"The day has been dominated by the ructions following the US decision to slap 219% tariffs on Bombardier, the result of a dispute with rival Boeing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report: The government has warned aircraft manufacturer Boeing it could lose UK defence contracts over its part in a US decision to slap punitive tariffs of 219% on rival Bombardier, in a dispute that threatens to sour trade relations between London and Washington. Theresa May said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bitterly disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the move to impose a tariff on sales of Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C-Series passenger jet, which threatens at least 1,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland. Michael Fallon, the UK defence secretary, stepped up the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric, warning that Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assault on Bombardier \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could jeopardise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its chances of securing government contracts. The business secretary, Greg Clark, joined the chorus of disapproval, branding the ruling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unjustified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and vowing to work with Canada - where Bombardier is based - to get it overturned. The backlash follows an interim decision by the US Department of Commerce, which agreed with Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case that Bombardier received unfair, anti-competitive state support from the Quebec regional government, including a \u00c2\u00a3740m bailout. Bombardier, which has also received \u00c2\u00a3113m in repayable funding from the UK government, called the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The full story is here: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full report on Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from his role as German finance minister: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet on her talks with Theresa May over Bombardier jobs: Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic Unionists, has said UK prime minister Theresa May has given a commitment to work to secure jobs in Belfast following the Bombardier row. The DUP of course have an important position in UK politics, given they are now propping up May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government in Westminster. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed US tax reforms have given some support to markets, but investors remain to be fully convinced the US president will be able to pass these latest plans given his legislative difficulties so far in his term. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: While the headlines are sure to focus on the tax cuts for rich individuals, the market focus will no doubt centre on the planned corporate tax cut which has the potential to sharply impact profitability throughout the market. With a hawkish Yellen and the prospect of a US economic boom, it comes as no surprise that the dollar has been a big outperformer of late. While the prospect of lower taxes promise a bounty for stocks, it is worth noting that Trump has yet to deliver on any major policies given the constant rebuttals from the Republican dominated Congress. There is a good chance that these tax reforms are going to be as difficult to pass at the health reforms, with issues such as the controversial border adjustment tax likely to provide significant hurdles along the way. There is also some notable caution thanks to the continuing concerns about the tensions between the US and North Korea. Even so, European markets managed to end the day in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 27.77 points or 0.38% higher at 7313.51 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.41% to 12,657.41 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.25% at 5281.96 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB gained 0.85% to 22,622.19 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.76% ahead at 10,368.9 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.5% to 736.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently flat on the day. Over to German politics again, and if the Greek government is celebrating the prospect of Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble leaving as finance minister, the joy may be short-lived. ING says: UK defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has ruled out cancelling existing orders with Boeing over the Bombardier dispute. But he pointedly added that there were other contracts which Boeing was expected to bid for in the future. Earlier Fallon told reporters in Belfast that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current relationship with Boeing could be damaged by the row and even suggested the UK might decline to buy Boeing products in future. Now he has told Reuters the UK would not cancel orders from Boeing for nine P-8 spy planes and 50 Apache helicopters but added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know they will be back at the door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement from Boeing, courtesy of the Press Association: We have heard and understand the concerns from the Prime Minister and the Government about Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Boeing is committed to the UK and values the partnership, which stretches back almost 80 years. The company has doubled its direct employment in the UK since 2011 and tripled its spending with more than 250 companies in the UK supply chain over the same period, to 2.1 billion in 2016. More than 18,700 jobs in the UK are at Boeing or in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tier one supply chain. Earlier this month Boeing broke ground for its first factory in Europe, in Sheffield. We are pleased to work with our partners, including the British Government, and provide such a vote of confidence in the UK. Any claimed economic threat to Bombardier is due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace, which explains its desperate action that prompted the ITC case due to Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to violate US trade rules. Boeing welcomes competition and Bombardier can sell its aircraft anywhere in the world. But sales must be made according to globally-accepted trade rules. We believe that global trade only works if everyone abides by the same rules of the road, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our respective aerospace industries. Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s petition to the International Trade Commission seeks to restore a level playing field in the US single-aisle airplane market. Boeing had to take action as subsidised competition has hurt us now and will continue to hurt us for years to come. With US refineries restarting after the closures caused by Hurricane Harvey, crude stocks fell by 1.8m barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 3.4m increase. But gasoline stocks rose by 1.1m barrels, rather than the 750,000 fall expected. More on the dollar. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A better than expected durable goods order reading, and the prospect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax speech this evening, allowed the dollar to maintain its post-Yellen growth this Wednesday. Ahead of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance in Indiana details have been leaked about his proposed tax plan, the headlines being a lowering of the corporate rate from 35% to 20%, and a reduction to the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%. The Republicans want to push through these tax reforms in part to distract from their complete and utter failure at repealing Obamacare. They face myriad obstacles, however, not least a Democratic Party who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be keen to hammer home the point that the proposed changes favour the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest members, something that might not go down well with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key base of support. Regardless, the prospect of progress on one of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market-wooing election promises has helped the dollar keep hold of most of its daily growth. The greenback was further shored up by a decent durable goods order figure, which came in at 1.7% against the 1.0% forecast and the miserable -6.8% the month previous. This all meant cable was pinned back at $1.34 after a 0.3% fall, with the euro suffering a 0.6% drop, taking the weary currency to a fresh, sub $1.175 one month nadir. Against the yen, which has been shaken in recent weeks by the North Korea situation, the dollar found even greater success, briefly hitting a 10 week peak of \u00c2\u00a5113. Ryanair is back in the headlines with its latest cancellations, and affected passengers are already having to rethink their plans. Henry McDonald writes: There is more airplane-related trouble for Northern Ireland on top of the Boeing versus Bomdardier battle and it comes in the shape of Rynair. The budget airline has announced on Wednesday afternoon that it is suspending its Belfast to Gatwick route from November to March. The Belfast-Gatwick route is Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular airlink to Britain in Northern Ireland. Among those affected by the four month cancellation of flights is former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon who tweeted today that her flight had been cancelled. A West Belfast choral society from the parish of St Agnes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will have to change their 60th anniversary bash in London in November. And here is a list of the affected routes: Back with Bombardier, and Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey, vice chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Aerospace, has slammed Boeing for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bully boy tactics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the disputed subsidy was in fact a loan: The launch aid that was provided to Bombardier which came via Treasury is repayable on the basis of royalties from sales so it is effectively a loan. Throughout my time as DETI and DEL Minister I am content that all transactions with Bombardier were consistent with EU State Aid rules. In the United States both cities and states give very substantial tax incentives and breaks to Boeing and other manufacturers. The majority of the C Series aircraft, by value, is actually produced in the US like the engine and avionics to name but two. What I see the core of this dispute being, given that Boeing did not even tender for the Delta Airlines contract, is an attempt by Boeing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in Europe, Airbus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to suffocate Bombardier. It is bully boy tactics. The manufacturing of the C Series sees a dramatic increase in efficiency and a reduction in fuel consumption that would mean when oil prices rise the plane becomes much more significant. It is not the current version of the plane that is the target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the long term project and what flows from it that has got Boeing in particular so aggravated. In the markets, shares are edging higher but investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing tensions between North Korea and the US and ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tax proposals. The dollar is moving higher following the hints from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that US interest rates could rise again as early as December. In turn that has helped lift European markets as a weaker pound and euro gives a boost to exporters. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.44%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.57% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.34%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.13% better. Earlier US durable goods orders climbed by 1.7% in August, better than the 1% analysts had been expecting. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: A sense of anticipation can be felt across the financial markets ahead of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax proposal in Indiana later today. Although some information has been leaked that corporate tax may be lowered to 20% from 35%, market players are still likely to closely scrutinise the speech for further details on tax reforms. If legislation is passed this year, this should boost sentiment towards the US economy and support the Dollar further. Back with the reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble is stepping down as German finance minister: Over in Canada, the 219% tariff imposed by the US on Bombardier has been described as an attack on the country. Quebec premier Philippe Couillard told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist. And Quebec will unite. All together we will protect our workers. All together we will be proud of our engineering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said Quebec had taken a $1bn stake in Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C Series plane but had not received any government subsidies. Back with the row over Bombardier, and Boeing said it understands the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns but blames its rival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weak products.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesman told Reuters that the company was committed to the UK and it had heard and understood the concerns of the UK government over Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers in Northern Ireland. But it added that any claimed economic threat to Bombardier was due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace. Earlier Boeing said in a statement: Global trade works only if everyone plays by the rules that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all endorsed to ensure fair competition, as adjudicated by independent national and international bodies. This dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition, which we welcome. Rather, it has everything to do with maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that aerospace companies abide by trade agreements. The process that will continue to play out over the next several months at the International Trade Commission and Commerce is the longstanding, transparent course for examining and addressing situations where products are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdumped\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into the United States at below-cost prices for the purposes of gaining market share. We have full confidence that this will continue to be a fair and fact-based investigation, and we look forward to its conclusion early next year. In the wake of the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election in Germany, there are now reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble will be stepping down as finance minister to become president of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble was first elected 45 years ago and is the longest-serving MP in the Bundestag. He has been finance minister since 2009, and was heavily involved in the bailout deals with Greece, albeit he had a fractious relationship with the struggling country. At one point he is believed to have said the heavily endebted Greece should leave the eurozone. A decade after the financial crisis, the global economy is still vulnerable to another crash. So says the World Economic Forum today, in a new report into global competitiveness. WEF warns that some banks are actually less sound than they were before the credit crunch struck in 2007, triggering the near-collapse of the financial system. The Fund says: After a long period of low growth following the global financial crisis, the world economy appears to have picked up speed. This is welcome news. Yet despite this gradual improvement, policymakers in many countries are concerned about the prospects for longterm economic development. This is partly because the current expansion appears to be cyclical, bolstered by exceptionally low interest rates rather than by the fundamental drivers of structural growth. Productivity improvements appear to remain sluggish and are not expected to return to the levels experienced in past decades. The report also showed that Britain has dropped to 8th, from 7th, in WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of competitiveness. WEF says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmacroeconomic environment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a concern (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reference to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, inflation and unemployment situation). It warns that this situation could deteriorate further after the UK has left the European Union. The United Kingdom (UK) (8th) falls one spot. This drop does not yet reflect the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, which is likely to further undermine the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness. Currently the country performs very well on technological readiness and the sophistication of its business sector (4th and 7th overall). Its macroeconomic environment remains challenging (68th) and could become an important constraint in the future as the timeline for a reduction of the fiscal deficit is repeatedly pushed back. The full report is online here. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has just told his party conference in Brighton that the tariffs imposed on Bombardier C Series planes threaten \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands of jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Corbyn says that Theresa May must use Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special relationship with America to protect the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers in Northern Ireland. Thousands of jobs are now at stake, thousands of jobs at risk A Prime minister betting our eocnomic future on a deregulated trade deal with the US might want to take a moment to explain how 220% tarifsf are going to boost our exports from this country. Are you one of the 400,00 people whose Ryanair flight has just been cancelled? If so, Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so disappointing for Ryanair passengers whose flights have been cancelled, even with more notice this time it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still seriously frustrating. Ryanair are still in a mess here, but you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be left out of pocket. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If your flight has been cancelled, ask for a refund. You should get your money back within 7 days or given an alternative flight. This should also apply to connecting flights you miss as a result, as long as they were booked together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aside from this, generally if your flight is delayed by over 3 hours you can claim compensation for the inconvenience. Cancellation amounts vary from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600 depending on your flight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If your other travel plans are impacted, look to your travel insurance for cover. This is when having a decent policy can really come in handy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wow! Breaking away from Bombardier.... budget airline Ryanair has just extended its flight cancellation programme, affecting an additional 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is cancelling 34 routes until next year, in a fresh attempt to tackle its rostering crisis that has left it without enough pilots. Those affected are being offered a refund or an alternative flight. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big u-turn; just last week, CEO Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said he hoped to avoid further cancellations. The UK government is rolling out the big guns against Boeing, with the defence secretary dropping an unsubtle hint that Britain could retaliate. Sir Michael Fallon has told reporters in Belfast that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current relationship with Boeing could be damaged by the row. He even suggests that London might decline to buy Boeing products in future: Fallon says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not the behaviour we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardise our future relationship with them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boeing has significant defence contracts with us and still expects to win further contracts. Boeing wants and we want a long term partnership but that has to be two-way. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom and an important employer in the United Kingdom but we would prefer this kind of issue to be settled on a negotiated basis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not the kind of behaviour that we expect from along-term partner and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made that very clear to Boeing. (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military arm produces a wide range of equipment, including Apache attack helicopters, Chinook transport helicopters and surveillance planes. As this infographic shows, Boeing also employs or supports more than 10,000 jobs in the UK; any tit-for-tat retaliation could affect them. Last night, Delta argued that Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case lacked merit, because it simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make an aircraft that competes directly with Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C Series: St\u00c3\u00a9phane Lessard, the consul general of Canada in Denver, warned that imposing steep tariffs on Bombardier could backfire. Here are some photos of Bombardier staff working on C Series aeroplane wings: Back in Belfast, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly has revealed he has family members employed at the Bombardier plant in East Belfast, and that he fears for their future job prospects. Chris Lyttle of the cross community Alliance Party is an East Belfast representative in the deadlocked Stormont Assembly. Lyttle said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was an astounding ruling but it is important to remember it is only preliminary. The US International Trade Commission must now find as Boeing did not compete for the Delta contract awarded to Bombardier C Series and does not serve this market, no injury has occurred. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have constituents, friends and family employed by Bombardier and I am acutely aware of the concern that exists amongst staff. Alliance has already engaged on this issue with the most senior levels of the UK, US and Canadian Governments and we will continue to do so, to work to achieve a fair outcome and protect the thousands of jobs in our aerospace manufacturing sector and economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This ruling could have severe implication not only for jobs in NI but for international trade with the United States, particularly in the aerospace sector. The UK government is turning up the pressure on Boeing. Business secretary Greg Clark says that the US planemaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaint against Bombardier is simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unjustified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and vowed to work with Canada to reverse last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preliminary ruling. We will work completely hand in glove with the Canadian government to get this overturned. Clark also believes that the final ruling in this dispute, due next year, should be in Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. The Trade Commission needs to look to see if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been any detriment to Boeing.. There hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been, as this aircraft doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compete with Boeing. Labour MP Conor McGinn, who was born and brought up in Northern Ireland, says the Bombardier dispute shows that Britain is stronger within the European Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hard Brexit campaigners in Government keep promising that Britain will get a great new trade deal with the US after we leave the EU. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how they justify their ideological choice to leave the Single Market and Customs Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But now we see the US Government taking a decision which is totally against our economic interests and could put thousands of jobs at risk across the UK, especially in Northern Ireland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on a good trade deal with the US being agreed after Brexit. To protect jobs and our economy, we need to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union to preserve trade with our largest market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Adams, head of aerospace at management consultancy, Vendigital, reckons that the Bombardier-Boeing dispute will take some time to resolve: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal challenge may in part be influenced by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy. The US manufacturer could be seeking to test the new administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve when it comes to protecting US jobs against foreign competitors selling to US customers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As history shows, trade disputes in the aerospace sector can become protracted - the Boeing / Airbus dispute ultimately had to be resolved by the World Trade Organisation. It is likely that Bombardier will appeal the US court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, before the final hearing in 2018. Manufacturing Northern Ireland, a trade body, have blasted the US tariff decision -- and warned that Britain could be more exposed to such rulings after it leaves the EU: In other news: UK retail sales have grown at their fastest pace in two years this. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest CBI Distributive Trades Survey, which suggests consumers are still spending despite rising inflation and weak wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a volatile survey, though, so.... The DUP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has repeated his warning that Boeing could be hit by retaliatory sanctions. Donaldson, who is the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief whip, tells Sky News: Boeing do sell a lot of aircraft to the UK, and to Canada, and to other countries. The US government has to weigh that in the balance as well. We think there is still a strong case to be made for Bombardier, and believe that common sense will prevail in the end. Q: So you would support tit-for-tat sanctions? Canada has made clear that they will impose import restrictions against Boeing, Donaldson replies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to say what the UK should do, he adds. He also disputes the suggestion that the row has anything to do with Brexit, pointing out that Britain is still in the EU today. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that the US president wants to take an entirely protectionist approach against its closely ally, Donaldson adds. Q: What are the implications for Northern Ireland if this preliminary decision is upheld? It would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devastating blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Bombardier if they were priced out of the US market, and we would struggle to keep the jobs in Belfast, Donaldson warned. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow industrial strategy minister, Chi Onwurah, has also heavily criticised Theresa May over the Bombardier tariff ruling. Onwurah told Sky News: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a damning indictment of the criminal negligence and complacency of Theresa May and her government, and a sign of their entire lack of international negotiating skills which bodes really badly for our post-Brexit negotiations. Worryingly, the value of Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate bonds has fallen this morning. That means traders believe the risk that the Canadian firm defaults on its debts has risen. Bloomberg has the details: Bombardier Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro-denominated bonds maturing in 2021 have declined the most in more than two years after the U.S. imposed import duties of 220 percent on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C-series plane, threatening to upend deliveries of more than $5 billion to Delta Air Lines Inc. next year. The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior unsecured notes are currently down by more than seven price points at 99.963, according to Bloomberg prices at 10am London time. The notes had already fallen 2.2 points on Tuesday -- the same day that competitors Siemens AG and Alstrom SA agreed to join their rail businesses. That bond has been one of the top 10 most actively traded in the European secondary bond market, according to MarketAxess subsidiary, Trax. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may comment on the Bombardier news when he addresses the Labour Party conference at noon today. Liberal Dem Leader Vince Cable has accused America of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprotectionist bullying\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over the Bombardier ruling. He is urged Theresa May to stand alongside Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government in refusing to accept the new tariffs lying down. Cable says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rather than simply expressing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbitter disappointment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, our government should be out there fighting for vital British manufacturing jobs in Belfast. May must support Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration in standing up to protectionist bullying from Donald Trump and his crude \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 philosophy. Do we really believe the US will save us from Brexit with a comprehensive trade deal, when this is how they deal with fair and free international competition?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Workers at the Bombardier aerospace factory in Northern Ireland have admitted they are shocked and stunned by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. The news that a tariff of 220% will be imposed on Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jet sales to Delta airlines has come a a big blow to the workforce, who make wings for the C Series planes. Geordie Burnside, a shop steward, says the size of the tariff - effectively tripling the cost of the C Series jet - has taken everyone by surprise. Burnside, who has worked at the factory for 26 years, told the Guardian that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been getting phone calls from early morning asking why the ruling had slapped down such an enormous tariff. They cannot believe the enormity of it or get their heads around it. There have been a lot of tough times at this factory over the last 26 years and we got through. I hope that the company will appeal and the battle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over yet. Burnside also warned that the decision has big ramifications for Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are highly skilled jobs inside this plant which is the biggest manufacturer in Northern Ireland. Thousands of other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs outside of Bombardier depend on this company too. There are a lot of worried people out there not only in Northern Ireland but the Republic and Britain who supply into Bombardier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very worrying time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Press Association have written a handy Q&amp;A on the trade dispute between Bombardier and Boeing. What is the row about? It centres on US-based Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations that Canadian-headquartered Bombardier received state subsidies allowing it to sell its C-Series planes at below-market prices in America. The DoC has carried out its own investigation and said it had made a preliminary determination that imports should be subject to a 219.63% import tariff, although it will continue to evaluate the figure. If the tariff is imposed when deliveries of the aircraft begin it will increase the cost of selling into one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important aviation markets. Bombardier is contracted to supply up to 125 C-Series aircraft to Atlanta-based Delta Airlines in a deal underpinning many staff posts at its manufacturing plant in Belfast. The UK Government has been actively lobbying in the US for a compromise between Boeing and Bombardier amid growing concern about the potential implications for Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Northern Ireland operations. What are the aerospace companies saying about it? Boeing submitted a petition with the US International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce in April which claimed large government subsidies helped Bombardier launch an aggressive campaign to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its C-Series aircraft in the US. It said there was a shared industry interest in a level playing field. Bombardier has repeatedly rejected Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims, accusing its rival of pure hypocrisy after it alleged anti-competition practices in the sale of aircraft. The manufacturer described the DoC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interim determination as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153divorced from the reality about the financing of multi-billion-dollar aircraft programmes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What are the implications for Belfast? Bombardier had been under financial pressure and invested large sums in its new jet programme, which is crucial to many jobs in the city. Last year the firm announced 1,080 job losses at its Northern Ireland plants following delays to the C-Series. It is one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest employers, with around 4,500 on the books. According to the GMB union it supports nearly 10,000 further jobs through its suppliers. What is the Government doing about it? Political powersharing at Stormont has been in cold storage for months. However the DUP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 anti-Brexit MPs are a crucial force propping up the Government in key votes after Theresa May lost her majority in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s General Election. DUP leader Arlene Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence has seen the Prime Minister lobbying US President Donald Trump during a recent visit to New York. Following the DoC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement the UK Government said it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to strongly defend UK interests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and labelled Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unjustified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More from Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadows secretary of state for Northern Ireland: Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devolved government collapsed in January, and the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political parties haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet agreed a new power-sharing setup. The CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business leaders, has warned that this deadlock is hurting the economy. Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland Director, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bombardier makes a huge contribution to the Northern Irish economy. They are a major regional employer and support a wider supply chain that stretches across Northern Ireland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision by the US Department of Commerce represents a challenge to the Northern Ireland economy and places an important driver of regional economic growth at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This just reinforces the need for the swift return of an inclusive devolved government. Government and business must work in partnership to deliver a new far-reaching industrial strategy to improve regional resilience, economic competitiveness and facilitate growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack has done a good blogpost explaining the issues around the Boeing-Bombardier case. In it, he points out that Boeing has received plenty of money from the US government over the years. Can it really complain about other companies getting subsidies with a straight face?! The deal with Delta to supply up to 125 planes was the largest order yet for its big hope, the C-Series, but an order only made possible, say Boeing, by absurdly low pricing made possible by Canadian and UK government subsidies. While it is true that Bombardier has received billions from the government of Quebec and the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension fund, Boeing has received more, a lot more, from the US military, Nasa and the State of Washington over many decades. Boeing would argue these were commercial arrangements, others would call them padded contracts amounting to subsidies. Jack adds that Theresa May is in a bind. She needs Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP to back her in parliament, but she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really afford to upset a major employer like Boeing either.... Boeing issued a polite but firm reminder to Theresa May that it employs 16,500 people in its UK supply chain and last week broke ground on a new facility in Sheffield. The Prime Minister may find it difficult to keep her new best friends in the DUP sweet while not offending such an important employer in the rest of the UK. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Labour MP Owen Smith, shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has heavily criticised Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. He says they were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccriminally negligent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for not persuading the US to reject Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim. Smith also points out that the decision suggests cracking a new trade deal with America after Brexit will be tough: Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a vocal opponent of Brexit, has also tweeted about the ruling: Unions are blaming Theresa May for not persuading Donald Trump to reject Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim. Ross Murdoch, of the GMB union,says the PM was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153asleep at the wheel when she could and should have been fighting to protect these workers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high time she woke up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic Unionists, also said the Department of Commerce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Foster says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The CSeries is a hugely innovative aircraft that is vital to Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in Belfast. It is this innovation that sets the C-Series apart and it is not in direct competition with Boeing. The Department of Commerce released its ruling against Bombardier last night - you can see it online here: U.S. Department of Commerce Issues Affirmative Preliminary Countervailing Duty Determination on Imports of 100- to 150-Seat Large Civil Aircraft From Canada It argues that Bombardier has received subsidies from the Canadian government on the C-Series planes that it has sold to the Delta airline, worth 219%. So, it is ordering US Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits on every plane shipped into America - effectively tripling the cost. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross says the Trump administration won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tolerate illegal subsidies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules. The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on the government to protect the thousands of Bombardier workers in Belfast. She stressed that the UK had followed the rules and added that the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs to be robust in their defence of that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bombardier situation is quite a crucial one because these are UK jobs that we depend on, thousands, and actually the government were involved in that contract process and were robust and I think that we have to defend the fact that that contract was awarded and we followed the rules. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At times Jeremy [Corbyn] talks about sometimes the global rules don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit UK jobs, but actually we followed the rules, we got that contract fair and square and the government must ensure that we protect those jobs to ensure that we can keep our businesses running.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: There are reports that Canada may retaliate by imposing a block on Boeing imports into Canada. Should Britain hit Boeing with reprisals too? Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP says it is too early to consider this, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only had the preliminary decision from the US Department of Commerce. But he drops a hint that the UK could hit back, saying Theresa May is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153putting down a marker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by criticising the decision so strongly today. If Boeing want to do business in the UK, they need to stop acting in such an unreasonable and irrational way against an aircraft that is innovative and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in direct competition with Boeing. If America is about free trade and free enterprise, it really shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be doing this. Reminder: Donaldson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is significant, as the DUP are now propping up Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government in Westminster. Q: Are you pessimistic or optimistic about Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances in this dispute, Sir Jeffrey? I believe David can defeat Goliath, Donaldson shoots back. Q: What did Trump say to Theresa May about this dispute? At that stage, they were waiting for the interim decision, replies Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll speak again now the decision is out. Donaldson adds: He [Trump] has adopted in the past a protectionist approach to US business. But we believe strongly in this case that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about protectionism because Bombardier and Boeing were not competing for the Delta aircraft [contract]. We think the C-Series is not in direct competition with Boeing. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, a Democratic Unionist Party MP, is also on the Today Programme. He says Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory is critical to Belfast, supporting 4,000 jobs and around 80 firms in the supply chain. There would be devastating consequences for the economy if the factory were closed, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Donaldson adds that Bombardier have a strong case, and accuses Boeing of acting unreasonably by bringing its case against its Canadian rival. The C-series is an innovative aircraft, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hugely competitive, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Boeing in the most unreasonable and irrational way have tried to block Bombardier from the market. Haley Dunne, director of public affairs at Bombardier Belfast, says the 219% tariff is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on Radio 4 she says that: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a preliminary decision, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue though the process.... The magnitude of the fines that are being imposed are absolutely absurd. Q: Can you give any guarantees to your workers that jobs are safe? Dunne says that Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meritless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and Bombardier are confident that the facts will support them in the end. However, there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no doubt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the C series jet is crucial to our future, she adds. This 219% tariff slapped on Bombardier could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kill demand for the C-Series in the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack on the Today Programme. He points out that last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpreliminary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A further ruling in February will examine how much damage has actually been suffered by Boeing (who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually pitch for this contract to supply jets to Delta). Some critics have claimed that Boeing is just trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strangle a competitor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by bringing its complaint, Jack adds. The UK government has hit back against the US Department of Commerce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to imposing a 219% tariff on sales of Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C-Series jet to Delta. Theresa May says she is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bitterly disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the move, and pledged to keep working with Bombardier to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. Unions had urged May to step in to protect Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. She raised concerns about the future of the factory in a recent phone call with President Donald Trump, and also discussed the issue with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau when she visited Canada this month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Thousands of aircraft workers in Northern Ireland have woken up to an uncertain future after the US sided with Boeing in its war against Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bombardier. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration have slapped Bombardier with preliminary tariffs of up to 219% on sales of its C-Series jet to the US airline Delta. This follows allegations from Boeing that Bombardier had unfairly used subsidies from the UK and Canada to sell its regional C-series jets at below cost into the US. The decision could be a huge blow to Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, as Bombardier is the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest hi-tech employer, with more than 4,000 workers. Our Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, explains how the decision will hurt Bombardier, and how Canada has already hit back: If imposed, the duties would more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold in the US to about $61m per plane, based on Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that Delta received the planes for $19m each. Bombardier called the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland reacted angrily to the decision saying it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly aimed at eliminating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow body jets from the US market. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking full reaction to the decision through the day. Also coming up today..... 11am BST: The CBI releases its survey of UK retail sales in September. Volumes are expected to rebound, after shrinking in August. 1.30pm BST: US durable goods figures for August. Economists expect a small rise, after a surprise 6.8% tumble in July. 2pm BST: The IMF publishes the Analytical Chapters of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook.
