Justin Welby said the UK needed to make fundamental choices about the direction of its economy, in a study that found the gains from growth are being diverted into profits rather than wages. \u201cOur economic model is broken,\u201d said Welby. \u201cBritain stands at a watershed moment where we need to make fundamental choices about the sort of economy we need.

It said the situation had worsened in recent years as workers struggled to make ends meet after the longest period of earnings stagnation for 150 years. The interim report by the commission, which was set up last year, proposes fundamental reform of the British economy \u201con a scale comparable with the Attlee reforms of the 1940s and the Thatcher revolution of the 1980s\u201d.

                "body":"<p>Apple\u2019s stock market value is heading towards a new milestone and its latest product launch on 12 September could push the tech giant closer to becoming the first ever $1tn (\u00a3760bn) company.</p> <p>At the end of last week, the company\u2019s market capitalisation hovered around $830bn, continuing a 10-year run that has generally headed upwards since a low of $69bn in January 2009, during the financial crisis. Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations.</p> <p>But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming.</p> <h2><strong>iPhone</strong></h2> <p>The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone&#xa0;8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success.</p> <p>Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently.</p> <p>But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\" data-alt=\"Apple's share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\">Apple's share price</a> </figure>  <p>The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d</p> <p>The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply. Apple needs to avoid that happening again, says Dawson: \u201cIt has to supply the new premium phone in high enough numbers so that if there\u2019s a big demand shift from the standard models to the new one, it doesn\u2019t end up depressing overall sales while there are supply constraints.\u201d</p> <p>Apple seems confident. For the current quarter, it has forecast revenues of $49bn-$52bn, which would represent growth of between 4% and 11% from a year ago, and bring its performance back to 2015 levels. Dawson expects that iPhone sales will grow year-on-year in the October-December and January-March quarters: \u201cMuch of the timing of that growth will depend on the supply constraints.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wearables</strong></h2> <p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/25/apple-watch-spring-launch-wearable-technology\" title=\"\">\u201cwearables\u201d \u2013 the market sector dominated by digital watches and Fitbits \u2013 were seen as the next technology hit</a>. But the first Apple Watch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-review-smartwatch-iphone-taptic-siri\" title=\"\">released in April 2015</a>, underwhelmed many reviewers.</p> <p>None the less, early adopters liked it; the research company IDC reckons 28.8m had sold by the end of July this year. Though Apple doesn\u2019t release unit sales or revenues, it is definitely the world\u2019s most popular smartwatch, while Google\u2019s rival Android Wear business has failed to take off.</p> <p>Now Apple is readying a version that can use 4G phone networks. It means those who have bought an Apple Watch for fitness reasons \u2013 the watch\u2019s biggest customer base \u2013 can stream music or podcasts while they run and work out, as well as making FaceTime video or audio calls, getting map directions, and receiving and replying to messages. According to Bloomberg, the 4G version will be on sale at the four US mobile carriers, and possibly through European networks too.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s wearables strategy doesn\u2019t stop at the Watch: its wireless in-ear AirPods headphones, which have been in short supply since their launch last year, have delighted those who managed to get their hands on them. With supply improving, they could be a Christmas hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81eacf54ed2890cca350c40a37501a80f7c0fd4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81eacf54ed2890cca350c40a37501a80f7c0fd4c/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Apple Watch: liked by its owners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apple Watch: liked by its owners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Home</strong></h2> <p>With the smartphone market now well established, the home is the new battlefield for the big tech companies. A few years ago most people expected that Microsoft would be a serious contender because its Xbox console was installed in millions of living rooms.</p> <p>But instead Amazon has taken a lead, having sold an estimated 15 million of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/amazon-echo-review-the-best-combined-speaker-and-voice-assistant-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">voice-controlled Echo and Dot devices</a>, which can provide weather, news and traffic reports and play music, as well as controlling digitally connected lights and similar devices around the home. Google joined in last year with its Google Home device. Now Apple is pitching in with HomePod, a high-quality music speaker controlled by its Siri voice assistant. As you might guess, it\u2019s pricey, with a reported cost of around \u00a3349 in the UK.</p> <p>Also expected is an update to Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box, to allow it to stream higher definition pictures. On its own, that might not sound much. But the company has big ambitions in the US market, where millions of homes are abandoning expensive monthly cable-TV contracts and opting for cheaper services such as Netflix. Apple always wants to get ahead of those broader digital trends. Now it aims to become an alternative TV service, offering a la carte programming if you buy its hardware.</p> <p>However, TV networks won\u2019t license their programmes cheaply because they want to retain the viewers who in turn watch the adverts that provide their revenues. So Apple is having to make its own. Eddy Cue, the executive behind this drive, is well-armed for the fight. As well as hiring TV and film executives, he has bought the rights to James Corden\u2019s <em>Carpool Karaoke</em> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/apple-said-to-plan-1-billion-investment-in-tv-shows-and-films\" title=\"\">has a $1bn warchest</a> for producing original content. Although that\u2019s a long way from Netflix\u2019s $6bn annual spending, or Amazon\u2019s estimated $4.5bn, Apple is ambitious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a1a7243f12bd9af1210b3497e60745fc43bc972\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a1a7243f12bd9af1210b3497e60745fc43bc972/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook: leading Apple into film and TV production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Software</strong></h2> <p>A new iPhone means a new version of Apple\u2019s iOS software, which will update about 500m existing devices as well as running on the new products. With iOS 11, iPhone and iPads will be able to run \u201caugmented reality\u201d (AR) apps, which can overlay <em>Star Wars</em> spaceships, or map directions, or geolocated information, on to a live camera view on the screen. AR apps are forecast to spark a new app boom; some of them will struggle, but it only takes one success to validate the entire field. And Apple will have an advantage over Android, where AR will only work on a few million devices by the end of the year.</p> <h2><strong>Services</strong></h2> <p>For the past seven quarters, and 12 of the past 19, the fastest-growing part of Apple has been its \u201cservices\u201d. Most recently generating $7.2bn \u2013 more than either iPad or Mac sales \u2013 it includes Apple Music fees, the 30% cut of payments and subscriptions on millions of apps in the App Store, and payment for iCloud storage (where only the first 5GB is free).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/09/apple-dash-content-from-handsets-to-hollywood\">From handsets to Hollywood: Apple joins the dash for content</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly pointed out to analysts that, on its own, the services segment generates enough revenue to enter the Fortune 100 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. As the iPhone user base grows, and people buy more apps, the services segment keeps growing. And if the Apple TV ploy succeeds, it could really take off. What Wall Street really likes about services, though, is its promise of recurring revenue, separate from hardware sales. If Apple grows its user base, the Services segment grows too; thus it also provides an indicator of the overall health of the company\u2019s ecosystem of hardware, software, users and developers. Suddenly, a $1tn valuation looks attainable \u2013 and sustainable.</p> <h2>Surprises</h2> <p>What else is Apple working on? The company\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cProject Titan\u201d, appears to have been scaled down and the firm will no longer build self-driving vehicles: according to reports, it will concentrate on the software behind autonomous cars instead. More likely to arrive sooner are \u201cAR glasses\u201d for putting augmented reality right in front of you. In March the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac83150-10db-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d\" title=\"\">reported that Apple is working on such glasses</a>; what\u2019s unclear, as ever, is the timescale. Months? Years? We can\u2019t be sure until Tim Cook shows it off on stage.</p>",

Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently. But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply. Apple needs to avoid that happening again, says Dawson: \u201cIt has to supply the new premium phone in high enough numbers so that if there\u2019s a big demand shift from the standard models to the new one, it doesn\u2019t end up depressing overall sales while there are supply constraints.\u201d Apple seems confident. For the current quarter, it has forecast revenues of $49bn-$52bn, which would represent growth of between 4% and 11% from a year ago, and bring its performance back to 2015 levels. Dawson expects that iPhone sales will grow year-on-year in the October-December and January-March quarters: \u201cMuch of the timing of that growth will depend on the supply constraints.\u201d Wearables A few years ago, \u201cwearables\u201d \u2013 the market sector dominated by digital watches and Fitbits \u2013 were seen as the next technology hit. But the first Apple Watch, released in April 2015, underwhelmed many reviewers. None the less, early adopters liked it; the research company IDC reckons 28.8m had sold by the end of July this year. Though Apple doesn\u2019t release unit sales or revenues, it is definitely the world\u2019s most popular smartwatch, while Google\u2019s rival Android Wear business has failed to take off. Now Apple is readying a version that can use 4G phone networks. It means those who have bought an Apple Watch for fitness reasons \u2013 the watch\u2019s biggest customer base \u2013 can stream music or podcasts while they run and work out, as well as making FaceTime video or audio calls, getting map directions, and receiving and replying to messages. According to Bloomberg, the 4G version will be on sale at the four US mobile carriers, and possibly through European networks too. Apple\u2019s wearables strategy doesn\u2019t stop at the Watch: its wireless in-ear AirPods headphones, which have been in short supply since their launch last year, have delighted those who managed to get their hands on them. With supply improving, they could be a Christmas hit. Home With the smartphone market now well established, the home is the new battlefield for the big tech companies. A few years ago most people expected that Microsoft would be a serious contender because its Xbox console was installed in millions of living rooms. But instead Amazon has taken a lead, having sold an estimated 15 million of its voice-controlled Echo and Dot devices, which can provide weather, news and traffic reports and play music, as well as controlling digitally connected lights and similar devices around the home. Google joined in last year with its Google Home device. Now Apple is pitching in with HomePod, a high-quality music speaker controlled by its Siri voice assistant. As you might guess, it\u2019s pricey, with a reported cost of around \u00a3349 in the UK. Also expected is an update to Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box, to allow it to stream higher definition pictures. On its own, that might not sound much. But the company has big ambitions in the US market, where millions of homes are abandoning expensive monthly cable-TV contracts and opting for cheaper services such as Netflix. Apple always wants to get ahead of those broader digital trends. Now it aims to become an alternative TV service, offering a la carte programming if you buy its hardware. However, TV networks won\u2019t license their programmes cheaply because they want to retain the viewers who in turn watch the adverts that provide their revenues. So Apple is having to make its own. Eddy Cue, the executive behind this drive, is well-armed for the fight. As well as hiring TV and film executives, he has bought the rights to James Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke and has a $1bn warchest for producing original content. Although that\u2019s a long way from Netflix\u2019s $6bn annual spending, or Amazon\u2019s estimated $4.5bn, Apple is ambitious. Software A new iPhone means a new version of Apple\u2019s iOS software, which will update about 500m existing devices as well as running on the new products. With iOS 11, iPhone and iPads will be able to run \u201caugmented reality\u201d (AR) apps, which can overlay Star Wars spaceships, or map directions, or geolocated information, on to a live camera view on the screen. AR apps are forecast to spark a new app boom; some of them will struggle, but it only takes one success to validate the entire field. And Apple will have an advantage over Android, where AR will only work on a few million devices by the end of the year. Services For the past seven quarters, and 12 of the past 19, the fastest-growing part of Apple has been its \u201cservices\u201d. Most recently generating $7.2bn \u2013 more than either iPad or Mac sales \u2013 it includes Apple Music fees, the 30% cut of payments and subscriptions on millions of apps in the App Store, and payment for iCloud storage (where only the first 5GB is free). Chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly pointed out to analysts that, on its own, the services segment generates enough revenue to enter the Fortune 100 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. As the iPhone user base grows, and people buy more apps, the services segment keeps growing. And if the Apple TV ploy succeeds, it could really take off. What Wall Street really likes about services, though, is its promise of recurring revenue, separate from hardware sales. If Apple grows its user base, the Services segment grows too; thus it also provides an indicator of the overall health of the company\u2019s ecosystem of hardware, software, users and developers. Suddenly, a $1tn valuation looks attainable \u2013 and sustainable. Surprises What else is Apple working on? The company\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cProject Titan\u201d, appears to have been scaled down and the firm will no longer build self-driving vehicles: according to reports, it will concentrate on the software behind autonomous cars instead. More likely to arrive sooner are \u201cAR glasses\u201d for putting augmented reality right in front of you. In March the Financial Times reported that Apple is working on such glasses; what\u2019s unclear, as ever, is the timescale. Months? Years? We can\u2019t be sure until Tim Cook shows it off on stage.",

Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, the insurance costs of this year\u2019s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year\u2019s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come.

                "bodyText":"A late PS: America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has closed at a new all-time high tonight. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1%, or 26 points, to 2,488.11 points, led by insurers, other financial firms, and tech stocks. The Dow Jones posted its biggest one-day jump since March. The rally was driven by relief that Hurricane Irma appears to have caused less damage than the worst-case scenarios. Marketwatch\u2019s Barbara Kollmeyer sums up the day: Wall Street optimism was underpinned by Hurricane Irma delivering a less forceful hit on Florida than expected and North Korea failing to conduct another nuclear missile test over the weekend, reviving investor appetite for assets perceived as risky, such as equities. But...Irma has still caused terrible damage to areas such as the Florida Keys, where homes have been destroyed and people are left without power and water. In Miami, roads have been turned into rivers, even though the eye of the storm missed the City. And we still don\u2019t know the final death toll. Associated Press reports that 41 people have been killed since Irma first struck the Caribbean. And finally, European stock markets have closed in a flurry of green electronic ink, as today\u2019s relief rally runs its course. Every major indices has risen today, thanks to two factors; the absence of fresh missile tests from North Korea, and signs that Hurricane Irma\u2019s total damage will come in below forecasts. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 0.5% higher at 7413, a one-week high, up 35 points. In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 233 points, or just over 1%, at 22,033. That means world markets, as measured by MSCI, are at all time highs as London\u2019s financial sector winds down for the day. Insurance companies continued to recover today - with Lancashire Holdings jumping by 10% in the City, and larger firms also recovering. David Madden of CMC Markets credits the latest news from Florida: The timing of Hurricane Irma wasn\u2019t great seeing as it quickly followed the tropical storm Harvey. Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm, and even though it has caused a considerable amount of destruction, it hasn\u2019t been as bad the markets were expecting. This also added to the bullish sentiment today, since the cost of the clean-up will be less than expected. Insurers like Aviva, Prudential and Legal &amp; General are all higher today as the payouts relating to Irma are likely to be below initial estimates. The situation in Florida remains very serious, of course, with some officials warning of a potential \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d following the massive hurricane. But in the financial markets, orange juice and cotton future prices are recovering on hopes that the economic damage will be containable.. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there was a \u201cbuying frenzy\u201d - although London\u2019s rally was held back because the pound has rallied 0.5% agains the euro. Beauchamp adds: Today\u2019s price action marks a step change from a week ago, when fears of conflict on the Korean peninsula drove equities lower. Now normal service has apparently resumed, with triple digit gains on the Dow and the Dax. The FTSE is making heavy going of it, however, as sterling continues to gain ground versus the US dollar. The pound shows little nervousness so far ahead of a big week for UK data, and even the prospect of voting on the government\u2019s EU withdrawal bill has not deterred the buyers. The debate around that bill is raging now: So that\u2019s a good moment to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The rally on the US stock market has legs; every sector on the S&amp;P 500 index is now up on the day, with insurance firms leading the charge. Orange juice futures contracts are dropping, as traders respond to signs that Irma\u2019s won\u2019t cause as much damage to Florida\u2019s citrus industry as feared. OJ futures are down 3% today, but that still means they are 9% more expensive than a week ago. Florida is the world\u2019s second-largest orange producer, so the hurricane damage to crops will have a knock-on impact on prices. Wall Street\u2019s rally is pushing world stock levels to fresh record highs. MSCI\u2019s All Country World Index is now up 0.75% today at 483.12 points, a fresh record level. The All Country World Index tracks around 2,400 stocks traded in 47 countries, so is a good gauge of equity levels around the world. After a minute\u2019s silence to mark 9/11, trading is underway on Wall Street. And shares are rallying, matching today\u2019s gains in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones index has gained 163 points, or 0.75%, with nearly every share rising. Travel firms such as Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival are among the top risers, reflecting hopes that Hurricane Irma will not be quite as severe as feared. Financial stocks and tech companies are also leading the way higher. The US dollar is also in favour, gaining almost 0.5% against other currencies today. Newsflash: Google has launched an appeal against the \u20ac2.4bn fine imposed by the European Union in June for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market. More here. The uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit form the EU hasn\u2019t shaken London\u2019s status as a financial powerhouse, according to a new report: The British pound is creeping higher this morning, as traders prepare for an influx of data later this week - and an interest rate decision. Sterling has nudged $1.321 against the US dollar, close to a five-week high. Tomorrow, the UK inflation rate is expected to rise to 2.8%, from 2.6% in July. That might refocus minds at the Bank of England about the possibility of raising borrowing costs from their current record low. The BoE meets on Thursday; the City doesn\u2019t expect a hike, but policymakers could hint that rates will rise faster than economists expect. Shares are expected to rally in New York, when trading begins in 90 minutes time. Rising share prices seems like an odd reaction to the devastation caused by Irma in the Caribbean and in Florida. But Wall Street had been bracing for even more damage. Our Hurricane Irma liveblog explains that Florida dodged a bullet: Florida can thank Cuba, where it did hit as a Category 5 storm, said Maue and Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground. Irma would probably have hit Florida as a Category 5 hurricane if it had missed Cuba, Masters said. The storm briefly trekked over Cuba\u2019s low populated coast Friday evening through Saturday afternoon. That weakened Irma enough that when upper level winds from the west eroded some of the storm\u2019s top and also blew in dry air, it had the combined of effect of making Irma more ragged, Masters said. It was at that point, he said, that Irma\u2019s southwest eyewall sort of came apart, no longer a perfect circle on satellite imagery. Slightly weakened from Cuba, the storm got caught up in competing weather systems a little longer, delaying its northward right turn into Florida. And that delay pushed the track further west, making it more of a threat to Florida\u2019s west coast than its east. Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate, BGC Partners, are holding their annual Charity Day, raising money for a wide range of good causes. The Charity Day was set up to remember the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald workers, and 61 employees of Eurobrokers employees, who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 16 years ago today. Cantor\u2019s New York headquarters was based in the North tower of the World Trade Centre. Cantor and BGC distribute 100% of their global revenues on Charity Day to the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and dozens of charities around the world. Over in Canary Wharf, a steady stream of celebrities - and the Mayor of London - have been raising money by trying their hand at trading.... The latest word from Florida is that 5.78 million homes are currently without power, or almost 60% of the state. But despite this disruption, there is relief that Irma has weakened since making landfall, and may not wreck as much havoc as some experts estimated. Daiwa Capital Markets strategist Chris Scicluna said (via Reuters): \u201cThe good news was that the eye of Hurricane Irma took a path west of Miami and has since weakened to a Category 1 storm so that damage in Florida \u2013 whilst still severe... appears not to be quite as catastrophic as had been feared last week. And thankfully there was no bad weekend news out of North Korea either.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest: North Korea\u2019s president can take the credit for today\u2019s market rally, says Joshua Mahony of City firm IG: On a day that is largely devoid of any major economic releases of note, it is Kim Jong-Un who provides the unlikely source of bullish sentiment evident throughout global markets this morning. With North Korea celebrating the anniversary of the nation\u2019s formation over the weekend, it has come as a surprise that we did not see a third consecutive weekend test from Kim Jong-Un. But this morning\u2019s optimism could be tempered by a meeting of the United Nations later today, when the UN will vote on whether to impose new sanctions on North Korea. Mahony explains: Given that North Korea has provided one of the main drivers of volatility in recent weeks, today\u2019s UN meeting over the potential implementation of further sanctions on the country will be crucial in gauging how likely we are to see further tests in the near future. With the US pushing for an oil embargo on North Korea, the Chinese and Russian decisions will be key, where their cooperation would be a kick in the teeth for Pyongyang leadership, sparking a likely military response. Newsflash: World stock markets have just hit a record high. Shares are continuing to climb in Asia and Europe, on relief that North Korea didn\u2019t conduct another missile test last weekend. Hopes that Hurricane Irma will be less devastating than feared are also pushing equities higher, with insurance companies among the top risers today (as mentioned earlier). Munich Re, one of the world\u2019s biggest reinsurance firms, are up over 4% this morning. The All Country World Share Index calculated by data firm MSCI has gained 0.35% to 481.25 points, helped by today\u2019s gains in Asia and Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 53 points at 7431, a one-week high. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at Interactive Investor, says the City is less worried about North Korea as economists try to assess the full impact of the hurricane season. \u201dEquity markets are staging a relief rally after a less painful weekend than feared. Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared. \u201cNevertheless, the insurance costs of this year\u2019s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year\u2019s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come. Florida is also a key supplier of agricultural produce to the US and wider market, not least orange-juice. \u201cIt is likely that the overall impact of the hurricane season will negatively affect US Q3 GDP, but boost Q4 and Q1 as the rebuilding effort gets into full swing. On the flip side, near-term inflation is likely to rise, not least as a result of higher gasoline prices. The combination of these two contrasting impacts leaves the Federal Reserve with an interesting dilemma over the remaining months of the year.\u201d Over in Greece technical teams of auditors representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors are flying in to prepare the ground for what officials are hoping will be a last and problem-free bailout review. Helena Smith reports from Athens What amounts to the beginning of a third bailout review begins on a very different note. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants the compliance audit to be wrapped up imminently, telling delegates attending the international Thessaloniki trade fair this weekend that his leftist-led administration wants it completed \u201cwith great speed.\u201d In his annual speech outlining the economic policies his government will adopt, Tsipras emphasised what he had repeatedly said during the French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit to Athens last week: that \u201cGreece is turning a page\u201d with growth and development after seven years of recession. Tsipras insisted that \u201cGrexit\u201d - ejection from the eurozone - had been replaced by \u201cGrinvest\u201d, as investor interest, the key to combatting unemployment, had surged. It is a far cry from the days when the young leftist firebrand vowed to stop the sell-off of Greece. China was the guest of honour at this year\u2019s Thessaloniki fair, with more than 160 Chinese firms represented. Tsipras opened his speech saying Chinese investors were \u201cwelcome\u201d in Greece. Foreign investment, he said, was vital to tackling joblessness, with youth unemployment still running at 40% in Greece. It could also help ameliorate the brain drain that had seen the best minds leave since the country\u2019s great economic crisis began. The government hopes that the latest review will be concluded by December so that Athens can successfully exit its current bailout program on time next August. In private, however, officials are voicing fears that creditor demands may get in the way. Troubled construction company Carillion has suffered fresh upheaval; Zafar Khan, its group finance director, has left the Company with immediate effect. Shares in Carillion are down almost 5%. Khan\u2019s departure comes two months after Carillion shocked the City with a big profits warning, partly due to problems with three public-private partnerships. Gold has lost its appeal this morning, as traders pile into riskier assets. Bullion has dropped by around 1%, or $20 per ounce, to $1,335. This morning\u2019s risk-on mood is also giving the US dollar a lift. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group writes: The US dollar rebounded at the open. The greenback gained against all of its G10 counterparts, except the Canadian dollar, as Hurricane Irma weakened after hitting Florida over the weekend. Greenpeace says today\u2019s offshore wind auction is a historic moment for green energy Emma Pinchbeck of Renewable UK, a trade body, has also hailed the low price of Britain\u2019s offshore wind farms: It\u2019s early, but the renewable energy industry may be tempted to crack open the champagne. A new UK government auction has just shown that the price of producing offshore wind power has dropped dramatically, bolstering the case for investing in green energy rather than nuclear. Wind developers bid aggressively for the latest government subsidies in the auction, with the winning bidders committing to building new windfarms for as low as \u00a357.50 per MWh. In comparison, Britain\u2019s new nuclear power station at Hinkley point will cost \u00a392.50 per MWh, and take two years longer to build. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: As well as a major boost for renewables in the UK, which have suffered from government subsidy cuts in recent years, today\u2019s auction will fuel a debate over whether ministers should rethink their commitment to new nuclear power to meet the country\u2019s carbon targets. The Green party said the results should sound the death knell for Hinkley Point C,which is currently being built by EDF in Somerset. Here\u2019s the full story: Europe\u2019s equity markets are all comfortably higher this morning, as geopolitical worries ease. City investors are hoping that Hurricane Irma may not cause quite as much economic destruction as feared. Insurance company shares are rising in early trading. Bermuda-based Lancashire Holdings has jumped by 6.7%, while Beazley (which runs several syndicates at Lloyds of London) are up 5.7%. Before the storm hit Florida, insurance companies were bracing for bills of up to \u00a3150bn. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: Investors are feeling somewhat relieved today after the most dire predictions in terms of a disaster caused by Hurricane Irma have evaporated. The damage caused by Hurricane Irma is still colossal as streets have been changed into rivers and nearly 3 million people are without any power. However, thankfully, the overall impact of Irma is falling short of prediction. It is important to keep in mind that the full damage picture will still be colossal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are rising this morning, on relief that last weekend passed without another provocation from North Korea. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has popped back over the 7,400 mark for the first time in a week, up 35 points in early trading. Other European equity indices are rising too, following a solid session of gains in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped by almost 1.5%, with Hong Kong and South Korea close behind: Fears that North Korea would mark its 69th anniversary with another nuclear test proved unfounded ; instead Pyongyang restricted itself to more traditional celebrations. Associated Press explains: North Koreans observed the country\u2019s 69th founding anniversary with celebrations that included laying flowers and bowing at statues and portraits of past leaders. But Pyongyang did not carry out another test of its developmental intercontinental ballistic missile, as South Korea\u2019s government had warned it might do. Attention now moves to the United Nations, where the United States has called for a vote later Monday on new sanctions. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have regained their risk appetite. There is a positive start to the new trading week after North Korea avoided further provocation during its Founding Day celebrations (despite US calls for a ban on selling it oil/gas, a clear attempt to get China to help more).... Also coming up today Insurance companies will be starting to count the cost of Hurricane Irma, as the mega storm continues to blast its way through Florida. Irma is currently heading for Tampa Bay, leaving more than three million US homes without power behind it. Experts fear that a storm surge at high tide could bring even more damage. And we\u2019ll be watching disgraced PR firm Bell Pottinger, which could drop into administration this week following the scandal of its \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d campaign in South Africa.",

Google Shopping will also operate as a separate business, seeking to make a profit, albeit it will continue to be part of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. The changes, introduced from Wednesday, are an attempt to answer the EU\u2019s claim that the Google shopping service could always outbid others for the advertising space at the top of the site, as its cash would not be leaving the wider company. The shopping service will have its own accounts, which it will provide to the European commission to scrutinise, and there will be Chinese walls within the company to ensure it gains no competitive advantage, Google said. The tech giant was forced to make the change after the European commission ruled in June that it had been artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, denying consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field. Google was set a deadline of 28 September to change its practices, or face huge daily fines. The company is appealing against an initial \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine tabled by the commission last June as a consequence of the ruling. The commission has been aware of Google\u2019s plan since August but Brussels has not given any indication as to whether the change goes far enough.

It is understood that of 300 price comparison sites, only about a dozen have so far agreed to take part in auctions for the advertising spots at the top of its search page. Al Verney, a spokesperson for Google, said that whatever the outcome the company had provided a level playing field that should satisfy the European regulator. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re implementing a remedy to comply with the European commission\u2019s recent decision. \u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping. \u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else.\u201d From Wednesday evening, users searching for products may notice a small change to the advertising panel at the top of the search screen that shows pictures of products with links to retailers\u2019 websites. Instead of Google\u2019s shopping comparison service monopolising all the slots, the name of the price comparison site that has won the ad space auction will be displayed below the picture of whatever product is being sought by the user. The commission\u2019s fine of \u20ac2.4bn was said to take into account the \u201cduration and gravity of the infringement\u201d, and was based on Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 countries where the illegality occurred. It was claimed by Brussels that Google\u2019s illegal promotion of its shopping service caused traffic to it to jump 45-fold in the UK, 35-fold in Germany and 19-fold in France.
