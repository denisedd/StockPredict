                "body":"<p>Apple\u2019s stock market value is heading towards a new milestone and its latest product launch on 12 September could push the tech giant closer to becoming the first ever $1tn (\u00a3760bn) company.</p> <p>At the end of last week, the company\u2019s market capitalisation hovered around $830bn, continuing a 10-year run that has generally headed upwards since a low of $69bn in January 2009, during the financial crisis. Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations.</p> <p>But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming.</p> <h2><strong>iPhone</strong></h2> <p>The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone&#xa0;8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success.</p> <p>Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently.</p> <p>But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\" data-alt=\"Apple's share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\">Apple's share price</a> </figure>  <p>The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d</p> <p>The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply. Apple needs to avoid that happening again, says Dawson: \u201cIt has to supply the new premium phone in high enough numbers so that if there\u2019s a big demand shift from the standard models to the new one, it doesn\u2019t end up depressing overall sales while there are supply constraints.\u201d</p> <p>Apple seems confident. For the current quarter, it has forecast revenues of $49bn-$52bn, which would represent growth of between 4% and 11% from a year ago, and bring its performance back to 2015 levels. Dawson expects that iPhone sales will grow year-on-year in the October-December and January-March quarters: \u201cMuch of the timing of that growth will depend on the supply constraints.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wearables</strong></h2> <p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/25/apple-watch-spring-launch-wearable-technology\" title=\"\">\u201cwearables\u201d \u2013 the market sector dominated by digital watches and Fitbits \u2013 were seen as the next technology hit</a>. But the first Apple Watch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-review-smartwatch-iphone-taptic-siri\" title=\"\">released in April 2015</a>, underwhelmed many reviewers.</p> <p>None the less, early adopters liked it; the research company IDC reckons 28.8m had sold by the end of July this year. Though Apple doesn\u2019t release unit sales or revenues, it is definitely the world\u2019s most popular smartwatch, while Google\u2019s rival Android Wear business has failed to take off.</p> <p>Now Apple is readying a version that can use 4G phone networks. It means those who have bought an Apple Watch for fitness reasons \u2013 the watch\u2019s biggest customer base \u2013 can stream music or podcasts while they run and work out, as well as making FaceTime video or audio calls, getting map directions, and receiving and replying to messages. According to Bloomberg, the 4G version will be on sale at the four US mobile carriers, and possibly through European networks too.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s wearables strategy doesn\u2019t stop at the Watch: its wireless in-ear AirPods headphones, which have been in short supply since their launch last year, have delighted those who managed to get their hands on them.

A few years ago most people expected that Microsoft would be a serious contender because its Xbox console was installed in millions of living rooms.</p> <p>But instead Amazon has taken a lead, having sold an estimated 15 million of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/amazon-echo-review-the-best-combined-speaker-and-voice-assistant-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">voice-controlled Echo and Dot devices</a>, which can provide weather, news and traffic reports and play music, as well as controlling digitally connected lights and similar devices around the home. Google joined in last year with its Google Home device. Now Apple is pitching in with HomePod, a high-quality music speaker controlled by its Siri voice assistant. As you might guess, it\u2019s pricey, with a reported cost of around \u00a3349 in the UK.</p> <p>Also expected is an update to Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box, to allow it to stream higher definition pictures. On its own, that might not sound much. But the company has big ambitions in the US market, where millions of homes are abandoning expensive monthly cable-TV contracts and opting for cheaper services such as Netflix. Apple always wants to get ahead of those broader digital trends. Now it aims to become an alternative TV service, offering a la carte programming if you buy its hardware.</p> <p>However, TV networks won\u2019t license their programmes cheaply because they want to retain the viewers who in turn watch the adverts that provide their revenues. So Apple is having to make its own. Eddy Cue, the executive behind this drive, is well-armed for the fight. As well as hiring TV and film executives, he has bought the rights to James Corden\u2019s <em>Carpool Karaoke</em> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/apple-said-to-plan-1-billion-investment-in-tv-shows-and-films\" title=\"\">has a $1bn warchest</a> for producing original content.

The companies include household names as well as US government departments.</p> <p>So far, six of Deloitte\u2019s clients have been told their information was \u201cimpacted\u201d by the hack. Deloitte\u2019s internal review into the incident is ongoing. </p> <p>The Guardian understands Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but it is believed the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016.</p> <p>The hacker compromised the firm\u2019s global email server through an \u201cadministrator\u2019s account\u201d that, in theory, gave them privileged, unrestricted \u201caccess to all areas\u201d.</p> <p>The account required only a single password and did not have \u201ctwo-step\u201c verification, sources said.</p> <p>Emails to and from Deloitte\u2019s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft.

                "bodyText":"One of the world\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms has been targeted by a sophisticated hack that compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, the Guardian can reveal. Deloitte, which is registered in London and has its global headquarters in New York, was the victim of a cybersecurity attack that went unnoticed for months. One of the largest private firms in the US, which reported a record $37bn (\u00a327.3bn) revenue last year, Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and high-end cybersecurity advice to some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies. The Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The companies include household names as well as US government departments. So far, six of Deloitte\u2019s clients have been told their information was \u201cimpacted\u201d by the hack. Deloitte\u2019s internal review into the incident is ongoing. The Guardian understands Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but it is believed the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016. The hacker compromised the firm\u2019s global email server through an \u201cadministrator\u2019s account\u201d that, in theory, gave them privileged, unrestricted \u201caccess to all areas\u201d. The account required only a single password and did not have \u201ctwo-step\u201c verification, sources said. Emails to and from Deloitte\u2019s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft. This is Microsoft\u2019s equivalent to Amazon Web Service and Google\u2019s Cloud Platform. In addition to emails, the Guardian understands the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information. Some emails had attachments with sensitive security and design details. The breach is believed to have been US-focused and was regarded as so sensitive that only a handful of Deloitte\u2019s most senior partners and lawyers were informed. The Guardian has been told the internal inquiry into how this happened has been codenamed \u201cWindham\u201d. It has involved specialists trying to map out exactly where the hackers went by analysing the electronic trail of the searches that were made. The team investigating the hack is understood to have been working out of the firm\u2019s offices in Rosslyn, Virginia, where analysts have been reviewing potentially compromised documents for six months. It has yet to establish whether a lone wolf, business rivals or state-sponsored hackers were responsible. Sources said if the hackers had been unable to cover their tracks, it should be possible to see where they went and what they compromised by regenerating their queries. This kind of reverse-engineering is not foolproof, however. A measure of Deloitte\u2019s concern came on 27 April when it hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells on \u201cspecial assignment\u201d to review what it called \u201ca possible cybersecurity incident\u201d. The Washington-based firm has been retained to provide \u201clegal advice and assistance to Deloitte LLP, the Deloitte Central Entities and other Deloitte Entities\u201d about the potential fallout from the hack. Responding to questions from the Guardian, Deloitte confirmed it had been the victim of a hack but insisted only a small number of its clients had been \u201cimpacted\u201d. It would not be drawn on how many of its clients had data made potentially vulnerable by the breach. The Guardian was told an estimated 5m emails were in the \u201dcloud\u201d and could have been been accessed by the hackers. Deloitte said the number of emails that were at risk was a fraction of this number but declined to elaborate. \u201cIn response to a cyber incident, Deloitte implemented its comprehensive security protocol and began an intensive and thorough review including mobilising a team of cybersecurity and confidentiality experts inside and outside of Deloitte,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAs part of the review, Deloitte has been in contact with the very few clients impacted and notified governmental authorities and regulators. \u201cThe review has enabled us to understand what information was at risk and what the hacker actually did, and demonstrated that no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte\u2019s ability to continue to serve clients, or to consumers. \u201cWe remain deeply committed to ensuring that our cybersecurity defences are best in class, to investing heavily in protecting confidential information and to continually reviewing and enhancing cybersecurity.
