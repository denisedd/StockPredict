Sorrell said WPP was preparing for Brexit by increasing investment in operations in key European markets, adding that free movement of staff was imperative to maintaining UK growth. \u201cAbout 17% of the 14,000 to 15,000 people we have in the UK come from the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are severe restrictions on their movement inward or outward in the future that will obviously impact our business in the UK. Our response [to Brexit] is to increase investment in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Those are four of our top 10 markets and we can\u2019t afford to lose influence or position in those markets.\u201d",

DoorDash said in a statement: \u201cWe investigate reports of inappropriate behavior and take action to deactivate those individuals from the platform that violate our policies,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile sometimes we may fall short of our customer experience goals, we\u2019re constantly working to learn from these experiences and respond to them even faster.\u201d While highly paid tech workers have complained about dysfunctional HR operations, gig economy drivers lament the fact they can struggle to even get a human on the phone when they are facing dangerous situations on the job. Often, drivers receive automated replies to their complaints. Arlena Bain, a driver for Instacart, which offers on-demand grocery deliveries, said she has felt vulnerable working in remote areas with no cell service. \u201cThey make us drive to these really unsafe zones \u2013 places that nobody wanted to deliver to,\u201d she said, adding that she did not turn down trips for fear that it would hurt her standing with the company. \u201cWe\u2019re so replaceable to them.\u201d Melissa, the DoorDash driver, said she wished the tech companies would be more respectful to the people who allowed the businesses to flourish. A DoorDash representative, she said, was not sympathetic when she called to report a man who was not a customer but had aggressively threatened her, claiming she was trespassing. \u201cTheir response was, \u2018You want to end [the shift] early?\u2019\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThey leave us out in the cold.\u201d Abandoned to abusers Though sexual harassment is not a new problem, online platforms have enabled methods of abuse that were not possible before, in some cases helping turn people into abusers. Franks, the law professor, said sites like Facebook and Twitter attracted \u201copportunistic harassers\u201d, by rewarding impulsive behavior and making it easy for them to inflict serious damage on victims with just a few clicks. On a fundamental level, the companies resisted substantive changes to their services that would limit abusive content, because they were driven by the overarching goal of maximizing engagement and use, said Franks, who is also the legislative and tech policy director with the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get a drop off in participation. In other words, they\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll work.\u201d In the case of revenge porn or \u201cnonconsensual pornography\u201d \u2013 when abusers spread sexually explicit images of victims without their consent \u2013 it can feel impossible for those who are targeted to protect themselves or get help from tech platforms. Even if one site is responsive and removes photos, the images can continue to spread, said Christina Gagnier, a California attorney who represents victims of online abuse and teaches at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. \u201cIt goes from Facebook to across the internet. It jumps from platform to platform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing whack-a-mole trying to remove all the photos.\u201d Victims trying to stop the abuse sometimes have no choice but to involve law enforcement, which can add to the trauma, said Gagnier: \u201cYou have to go into a court of law and discuss this in the public record.\u201d Alexandra Tweten, who created a popular site that posts harassing messages from men on online dating services, said she has dealt with people who have found her personal social media pages and been able to keep sending her abusive messages and explicit images by creating fresh accounts after she blocks them. Tweten provided examples of recent submissions to her website of angry men who were rejected on Tinder. One responded: \u201cYou are 200 lbs overweight, you should at least be polite.\u201d Another man appeared to try to blackmail a woman into sleeping with him, saying that if she did not, he would send screenshots of their conversations to \u201cpeople you know\u201d, adding, \u201cgood luck\u201d. She noted that it could be hard to get the websites to hold men accountable, because harassers create new profiles and find new targets: \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s the same guys who are doing it to everyone.\u201d The notion that platforms are not responsible or liable for the actions of their users, including criminal behavior, extends across Silicon Valley. Leslie Lapayowker recently sued Airbnb, alleging that a host who sexually assaulted her had not been properly screened by the company. She added that it had been especially painful to discover that the man had previously been accused of domestic violence, but was still allowed to host. Airbnb said the man had not been convicted of a previous crime and was banned from the platform after the woman reported him. The host vehemently denied the assault allegations. Lapayowker said: \u201cI was just shocked that this could even happen. I just feel like they are hiding behind legalities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ruined my life. I\u2019m not the same person. I\u2019m not the outgoing, funny, engaging person that I was.\u201d Have you experienced harassment as a tech employee or worker in the gig economy?
