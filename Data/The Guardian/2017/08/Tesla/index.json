Japanese car manufacturer Mazda claims to have designed a vehicle that will largely eliminate the need for spark plugs in petrol engines, increasing fuel efficiency by as much as 30%. The development also increases the existential threat facing diesel engines because its fuel economy could match diesel\u2019s performance without high emissions of nitrogen oxides or sooty particulates. Mazda said it would sell cars from 2019 with a newly developed petrol compression ignition engine, a technology that automotive manufacturers, including deep-pocketed rivals such as Daimler AG and General Motors, have been chasing for decades. The engine ignites petrol through compression, removing the need for spark plugs and increasing fuel efficiency. The announcement places traditional engines at the centre of Mazda\u2019s manufacturing strategy, days after the company \u2013 which sells 1.5m cars a year \u2013 said it will work with larger rival Toyota to develop electric vehicles. \u201cWe think it is an imperative and fundamental job for us to pursue the ideal internal combustion engine,\u201d said Mazda\u2019s head of research and development, Kiyoshi Fujiwara. \u201cElectrification is necessary but ... the internal combustion engine should come first.\u201d But Mazda said its Skyactiv-X engine would have spark plugs that would be used in certain situations such as at low temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s a major breakthrough,\u201d said Ryoji Miyashita, chairman of automotive engineering company AEMSS.

But it didn\u2019t prevent Snap being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/snapchat-ipo-valuation-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy-snap-inc\" title=\"\">valued at a colossal $28bn on its first day of trading</a> on the US stock market in March.</p> <p>Five months later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/snapchat-shares-fall-losses-wall-street\" title=\"\">the valuation has halved</a>, prompting chief executive Evan Spiegel to pledge that he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won\u2019t sell any of their shares this year. This promise was meant to signal the duo\u2019s deep belief in the long-term success of Snap. In fact, the gesture was no more than the minimum required to sustain flagging spirits. If the founders had left their options open with the shares trading below their IPO price, there would have been panic. As it was, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/snapchat-shares-fall-losses-wall-street\" title=\"\">the shares fell 16% after second-quarter results on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Debate around those figures was dominated by Spiegel\u2019s assertion that Wall Street analysts are looking at his camera app company through the wrong lens. Forget about the number of daily users, he argued with irritation, and look at the amount of time users spend on Snapchat, and how much advertisers are willing to pay.</p> <p>Spiegel\u2019s general point is fair: advertising revenue is what ultimately counts. The trouble is, Snap doesn\u2019t yet have a good story to tell on that front. Average revenue per user was $1.05 in the quarter, up from $0.90 in the previous three months. A quarter-on-quarter increase of 16% is not be sniffed at, but the revenue numbers only become explosive when combined with lots of new users. Snap added only 7.3 million, a quarter-on-quarter rise of only 4%, to reach 173 million. No wonder Spiegel would prefer people to look somewhere else.</p> <p>The awkward fact remains that Snap is actually a small company in its industry. Revenues were $182m in the quarter and $331m over six months. That suggests that reaching $1bn for 2017, as some on Wall Street had expected, will be a stretch.</p> <p>Even if it achieved that, is it really sensible to value Snap at 14 times its revenues? The figure seems absurd when you remember that this is a six-year-old business that still makes heavy losses and has to face the formidable companies of Facebook \u2013 especially Instagram, which seems to be directly aimed at Snapchat these days.</p> <p>One can\u2019t blame Spiegel, of course, if investors were prepared to put such a high price on hope at the IPO. Investors were so mad for a slice of the action that they all allowed him to get away with the governance outrage of issuing shares with no voting rights whatsoever. That\u2019s their lookout.

Or, rather, if there is, it is a different kind of bubble from the one that popped in 2001. Back then, almost every stock with a \u201cnew economy\u201d tag went up like a rocket.

Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u2019s healthy.

                "bodyText":"When a male customer grabbed Melissa\u2019s breast, she didn\u2019t bother reporting it to DoorDash, the on-demand food delivery service that hired her as a driver. She didn\u2019t think the company would care. When a different customer had sexually harassed her a month earlier \u2013 texting her a pornographic video through the app \u2013 DoorDash did little to help, she said. The company canceled the order, but allowed the man to continue sending her multiple messages. \u201cI felt very fearful. I felt very alone,\u201d said Melissa, 32, who asked to use only her first name. \u201cI questioned whether I wanted to continue to do this, but I\u2019m financially dependent on it. This is my income.\u201d In recent months, Silicon Valley has faced widespread backlash surrounding the sexual misconduct and discrimination that some say is rampant in the male-dominated tech industry. But almost entirely overlooked amid the public outrage is the massive pool of low-wage workers \u2013 especially in the sharing economy \u2013 who are vulnerable to a wide range of abuses on the job because they lack basic labor rights. And while corporate scandals continue to make headlines \u2013 most recently involving a Google engineer\u2019s memo criticizing diversity initiatives \u2013 there has been minimal scrutiny of the harassment, abuse and discrimination the tech products have enabled by connecting strangers through the internet. That includes sexual assaults of Uber drivers and food deliverers, physical attacks and racist abuse by Airbnb hosts, and violent threats on Twitter, Facebook and dating apps. \u201cWe have to talk about this as a problem these platforms have created,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a University of Miami law professor who studies online abuse. \u201c[If you\u2019re] going to set up a platform to make it possible for people to instantaneously communicate with people they don\u2019t know ... you know full well it\u2019s going to be abused and weaponized.\u201d \u2018You\u2019re on your own\u2019 In the same way that female engineers and startup founders struggle to report harassment for fear of retaliation or lost funding, gig economy workers are in precarious positions when they are victimized, since they aren\u2019t classified as employees. \u201cDoorDash is like, \u2018You\u2019re an independent contractor. You\u2019re in business for yourself. You know the risks. You\u2019re on your own,\u2019\u201d said Melissa, who has been driving full-time for the company since last fall. A spokesperson said that in the case of the man who sent her pornography, the customer was deactivated, though there was a five-minute window when he could still text her. The success of many on-demand companies like DoorDash depends on hiring a large, cheap workforce of contract employees who have no benefits or job security. That\u2019s the model for a wide range of companies, including the taxi apps Uber and Lyft, and other delivery services, such as GrubHub, UberEats, Caviar, Instacart and Postmates. The companies argue that drivers can be their own bosses and enjoy flexible hours. But some workers say they can\u2019t make ends meet and are ignored when they complain about working conditions. Saba Waheed, research director at the University of California, Los Angeles, labor center, argued that if the firms allowed workers to unionize or treated them like employees, then drivers would have legal means to speak up and the companies would be more liable for their safety. \u201cThere has to be a more direct responsibility. You\u2019re earning so much profit off of this workforce.\u201d The corporations\u2019 inaction can be especially painful when workers are harassedand threatened on the job, facing the kinds of misconduct that human resources departments would be obligated to investigate if the offenses were happening to office employees. Grace, an Uber driver in her 50s who works in San Francisco, where the company is headquartered, said she had been groped by passengers four times in three years. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t believe that most women could handle these situations that I\u2019ve been in,\u201d said Grace, who requested not to use her full name out of fear that Uber would retaliate. When passengers mistreat her, she said, she typically gave them low ratings, but did not raise concerns to Uber because she worried reporting could get her in trouble. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid of being deactivated, because I need the money,\u201d said Grace, who said it was common for her to feel unsafe with drunk and belligerent passengers. She recounted one incident when she said she turned down a group of riders because there were too many for her car, leading one to grow angry and kick the vehicle. The Guardian has previously reported on two women who drove for Uber and said they were violently assaulted by passengers. They said Uber did little to support them and the company failed to work with police to help bring charges. Dolores Benitez, who used to be a New York City taxi driver but now works for Uber and other ride-sharing companies, said she had dealt with passengers physically fighting in her car and riders having sex. One intoxicated rider began aggressively kicking her seat when he thought she was going the wrong way, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a partition in the car. If the person wants to do something to you, they will do it,\u201d said Benitez, 64, adding that she felt the companies would generally side with the passengers if there were disputes about misconduct. \u201cIt\u2019s your word against their word. They, as passengers, have the rights.\u201d Uber has noted that it investigates reports of harassment and assault by passengers and bans them from the platform as a result. A spokesperson said the company had a 24/7 incident response team and that drivers could easily connect to live representatives to report problems. DoorDash said in a statement: \u201cWe investigate reports of inappropriate behavior and take action to deactivate those individuals from the platform that violate our policies,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile sometimes we may fall short of our customer experience goals, we\u2019re constantly working to learn from these experiences and respond to them even faster.\u201d While highly paid tech workers have complained about dysfunctional HR operations, gig economy drivers lament the fact they can struggle to even get a human on the phone when they are facing dangerous situations on the job. Often, drivers receive automated replies to their complaints. Arlena Bain, a driver for Instacart, which offers on-demand grocery deliveries, said she has felt vulnerable working in remote areas with no cell service. \u201cThey make us drive to these really unsafe zones \u2013 places that nobody wanted to deliver to,\u201d she said, adding that she did not turn down trips for fear that it would hurt her standing with the company. \u201cWe\u2019re so replaceable to them.\u201d Melissa, the DoorDash driver, said she wished the tech companies would be more respectful to the people who allowed the businesses to flourish. A DoorDash representative, she said, was not sympathetic when she called to report a man who was not a customer but had aggressively threatened her, claiming she was trespassing. \u201cTheir response was, \u2018You want to end [the shift] early?\u2019\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThey leave us out in the cold.\u201d Abandoned to abusers Though sexual harassment is not a new problem, online platforms have enabled methods of abuse that were not possible before, in some cases helping turn people into abusers. Franks, the law professor, said sites like Facebook and Twitter attracted \u201copportunistic harassers\u201d, by rewarding impulsive behavior and making it easy for them to inflict serious damage on victims with just a few clicks. On a fundamental level, the companies resisted substantive changes to their services that would limit abusive content, because they were driven by the overarching goal of maximizing engagement and use, said Franks, who is also the legislative and tech policy director with the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get a drop off in participation. In other words, they\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll work.\u201d In the case of revenge porn or \u201cnonconsensual pornography\u201d \u2013 when abusers spread sexually explicit images of victims without their consent \u2013 it can feel impossible for those who are targeted to protect themselves or get help from tech platforms. Even if one site is responsive and removes photos, the images can continue to spread, said Christina Gagnier, a California attorney who represents victims of online abuse and teaches at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. \u201cIt goes from Facebook to across the internet. It jumps from platform to platform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing whack-a-mole trying to remove all the photos.\u201d Victims trying to stop the abuse sometimes have no choice but to involve law enforcement, which can add to the trauma, said Gagnier: \u201cYou have to go into a court of law and discuss this in the public record.\u201d Alexandra Tweten, who created a popular site that posts harassing messages from men on online dating services, said she has dealt with people who have found her personal social media pages and been able to keep sending her abusive messages and explicit images by creating fresh accounts after she blocks them. Tweten provided examples of recent submissions to her website of angry men who were rejected on Tinder. One responded: \u201cYou are 200 lbs overweight, you should at least be polite.\u201d Another man appeared to try to blackmail a woman into sleeping with him, saying that if she did not, he would send screenshots of their conversations to \u201cpeople you know\u201d, adding, \u201cgood luck\u201d. She noted that it could be hard to get the websites to hold men accountable, because harassers create new profiles and find new targets: \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s the same guys who are doing it to everyone.\u201d The notion that platforms are not responsible or liable for the actions of their users, including criminal behavior, extends across Silicon Valley. Leslie Lapayowker recently sued Airbnb, alleging that a host who sexually assaulted her had not been properly screened by the company. She added that it had been especially painful to discover that the man had previously been accused of domestic violence, but was still allowed to host.

Lapayowker said: \u201cI was just shocked that this could even happen. I just feel like they are hiding behind legalities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s ruined my life. I\u2019m not the same person. I\u2019m not the outgoing, funny, engaging person that I was.\u201d Have you experienced harassment as a tech employee or worker in the gig economy?

                "bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer is poised to lose its crown in the British fashion industry to its younger online rival Asos, in what is being described as a seminal moment for UK retail. In the latest sign of traditional corporate powerhouses being overtaken by newer technology-focused firms, the market value of 17-year-old Asos is just shy of \u00a3100m below that of the 113-year-old mainstay of the UK high street. M&amp;S has a market value of \u00a35.08bn, compared with Asos\u2019s \u00a34.98bn. City analysts said it was only a matter of time before Asos leapfrogged M&amp;S.
