Plus, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always the chance of a political crisis blowing up on the continent.</p> <p>Badiani writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Eurozone political uncertainties have been diluted by Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convincing win in the French presidential election and the defeat of the populist Freedom party in the Dutch elections, although they have not disappeared. Further uncertainty comes from the German election in September (although Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christian Democratic Union party is currently riding high in opinion polls), and a 2017 election is very possible in Italy following Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform. Additionally, although a third general election has been avoided in Spain, the minority government seems certain to find life difficult. </p> <p>We also suspect the Brexit vote could further damage Eurozone activity in 2017 and 2018, now that the United Kingdom has triggered Article 50 (on 29 March), and its exit negotiations with the EU are under way.</p> <p>On balance, Eurozone GDP growth is seen improving from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.0% in 2017 before easing back to 1.9% in 2018. Growth should be helped by reduced political uncertainty, assuming no major shocks occur during 2017.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-598082f2e4b0dc6c3f0fe7f4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-01T13:36:13.738Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow Jones hits (another) record high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Boom!

The recent appreciation of the euro is therefore unlikely to slow the current expansion significantly for the moment, given the domestic strength of the economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59804afae4b0d340766cc690\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-01T09:48:08.643Z\">10.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eurozone policymakers will be cheered by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, says Mehreen Khan of the FT:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The health of the eurozone economy has confounded critics this year after a series of electoral setbacks for eurosceptic parties in the Netherlands, Austria, and France has boosted business and consumer confidence.</p> <p>The economy has now expanded for 17 consecutive quarters and unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c long a scourge of the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest economies- \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is now at a nine-year low 0f 9.1%.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fastFT/status/892311312935645185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The eurozone economy picked up pace to grow 0.6 per cent in the second quarter <a href=\"https://t.co/axFmvVVQtE\">https://t.co/axFmvVVQtE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/otbmrhC3D1\">pic.twitter.com/otbmrhC3D1</a></p>&mdash; fastFT (@fastFT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fastFT/status/892311312935645185\">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5980492ce4b0dc6c3f0fe6dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-01T09:27:06.771Z\">10.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This chart shows how the eurozone has outpaced Britain in the last six months, after lagging behind in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Rupert_Seggins/status/892314086347853825\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Eurozone growth picks up to 0.6%q/q in Q2, for its 3rd consecutive solid quarter of growth, at the same time as the UK economy has slowed. <a href=\"https://t.co/TyBKA0ZLxj\">pic.twitter.com/TyBKA0ZLxj</a></p>&mdash; Rupert Seggins (@Rupert_Seggins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rupert_Seggins/status/892314086347853825\">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59804420e4b0d340766cc676\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-01T09:14:30.859Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone grows by 0.6% as recovery strengthens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official!

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone growth figures, from my colleague Katie Allen: The eurozone economy has grown twice as fast as the UK in recent months, according to official figures that underscore the divergence between Britain and its neighbouring currency bloc after the Brexit vote. GDP in the 19 countries that use the euro expanded 0.6% in the second quarter of 2017, building on growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, according the EU statistics body Eurostat (pdf). In the UK by contrast, the latest official figures released last week showed the economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017 following 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year. The economy had shown resilience in the immediate aftermath of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, confounding forecasts of a downturn. But growth has slowed markedly since the turn of the year as a weaker pound has raised the cost of imports, pushed up inflation and squeezed consumers. In the eurozone, growth has quickened and unemployment has fallen against the backdrop of ultra-low interest rates and other measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) to boost activity. Eurostat said second-quarter GDP was up 2.1% compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since 2011 and in line with forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll. Bert Colijn, a senior eurozone economist at the bank ING, said the bloc had enjoyed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surprisingly strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd first half to 2017. Eurostat did not provide any detail about what had driven growth in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early estimate of GDP but Colijn said domestic demand continued to be an important factor. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some countries have already released their first estimates of second-quarter GDP growth, showing that the expansion is broad-based within the eurozone. France, Spain, Austria and Belgium all recorded solid growth rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All in all, the eurozone economy has rounded out the first half of the year in a very healthy state and seems to be set up nicely for continued firm growth for the rest of 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. GW Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has slowed a little, and the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders have been hit by falling spending too. The ISM survey of the US factory sector dipped to 56.3 for July, down from 57.8 in June. That still shows growth, but at a slower rate. A separate report shows that US construction spending fell by 1.3% in June, dashing hopes of a small rise. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to a 5.4% tumble in public spending on building projects; a reminder that America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t launched the massive infrastructure spending programme promised by Donald Trump..... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures could signal that 2017 will be a vintage year for the eurozone, says IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Raj Badiani. He says that the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme, which runs until at least the end of December, should support the economy. But, he also suspects growth will slow next year, as Britain moves closer to the EU exit door. Plus, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always the chance of a political crisis blowing up on the continent. Badiani writes: Eurozone political uncertainties have been diluted by Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convincing win in the French presidential election and the defeat of the populist Freedom party in the Dutch elections, although they have not disappeared. Further uncertainty comes from the German election in September (although Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christian Democratic Union party is currently riding high in opinion polls), and a 2017 election is very possible in Italy following Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform. Additionally, although a third general election has been avoided in Spain, the minority government seems certain to find life difficult. We also suspect the Brexit vote could further damage Eurozone activity in 2017 and 2018, now that the United Kingdom has triggered Article 50 (on 29 March), and its exit negotiations with the EU are under way. On balance, Eurozone GDP growth is seen improving from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.0% in 2017 before easing back to 1.9% in 2018. Growth should be helped by reduced political uncertainty, assuming no major shocks occur during 2017. Boom! The US stock market rally has driven the Dow Jones industrial average to a new record high. As the chimes of the opening trading bell fade away, the Dow jumped by 94 points to 21,985 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just 15 points shy of the 22,000 milestone which Donald Trump was aiming for.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone GDP figures have helped to keep shares buoyant in Europe today. The main indices are all up today, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and the French CAC all up around 0.8%. Wall Street is expected to rally today too, and the Dow Jones could hit a new all-time high over 22,000 points. The president of the US hopes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying attention.... Although Britain is lagging behind the eurozone this year, it has still done better overall in the 10 years since the financial crisis. Ben Chu of the Independent has the details: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the Bank of England was quicker to ease monetary policy, slash interest rates to record lows, and start a quantitative easing stimulus scheme. This chart, from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report, shows how the UK and Germany have basically grown at the same rate since 2007, behind Canada, but much faster than France or Italy. Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brisk growth is overshadowing Britain right now.... Thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust data, the eurozone has now posted 17 quarters of growth in a row. This expansion dates back to early 2013, during the debt crisis which gripped the continent for years. The previous autumn, the European Central Bank had finally woken up to the challenge, and promised to buy the debt of countries such as Spain and Italy in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunlimited quantities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Although never acted on, that pledge helped to calm worries that the eurozone might break up, and paved the way for the recovery. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment commissioner, Marianne Thyssen, tweets: But Angel Talavera of Oxford Economics suggest the eurozone could have done even better.... We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy, Germany, performed in the last quarter. Economists expect solid growth, following Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% expansion in the first three months of the year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even possible that a strong performance from Germany could push up the eurozone growth rate to 0.7%. Jack Allen of Capital Economics explains: German Q2 GDP has not yet been published, and the euro-zone aggregate has been produced using an estimate for Germany. Given that the monthly data in Germany point to a very sharp acceleration in growth there, to as much as 1%, the euro-zone aggregate may yet be revised up. And the timelier surveys point to continued strong growth at the start of Q3. On an annual basis, the eurozone is now growing at the fastest pace since 2011. That underlines how its economy has strengthened in the last year. Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING, says the eurozone is in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very healthy state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right now, after growing by over 1% since the start of the year. Colijn expects further growth in 2017, following a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surprisingly strong first half to 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: No breakdowns for Eurozone GDP have been released so far, but domestic demand continues to be an important driver of growth. Especially the recovery in investments has been strong over recent quarters and has likely continued to boost GDP growth in the second quarter. The same holds good for consumption, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. On the back of an accelerating jobs recovery and the highest consumer confidence since 2001, consumption is likely to have contributed significantly to growth as well. The recent appreciation of the euro is therefore unlikely to slow the current expansion significantly for the moment, given the domestic strength of the economy. Eurozone policymakers will be cheered by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, says Mehreen Khan of the FT: The health of the eurozone economy has confounded critics this year after a series of electoral setbacks for eurosceptic parties in the Netherlands, Austria, and France has boosted business and consumer confidence. The economy has now expanded for 17 consecutive quarters and unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c long a scourge of the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest economies- \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is now at a nine-year low 0f 9.1%. This chart shows how the eurozone has outpaced Britain in the last six months, after lagging behind in 2016. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! The eurozone grew twice as fast as the UK in the second quarter of 2017, as its recovery gathers pace. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.6% in the three months to June, new figures from Eurostat show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty decent growth rate, as the region puts its debt crisis behind it. This is an acceleration on the first quarter, when eurozone rose by 0.5% (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been revised down from 0.6%). On an annual basis, the eurozone GDP expanded by 2.3% during the quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlines how the region has strengthened in recent months, driving unemployment down to a nine-year low. In contrast, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only grew by 0.3% in April-to-June, and 0.2% in Q1, as subdued consumer spending and rising inflation hit growth. Figures released last Friday showed that France grew up 0.5% in the last quarter, while Spain achieved 0.9% growth and Sweden stormed ahead with 1.7% growth. More to follow.... The pound has hit a 10-month high against the US dollar, at $1.3235. The pick-up in UK factory growth is boosting sterling. Meanwhile, traders are shunning the dollar as the crisis at the White House continues to escalate with Anthony Scaramucci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock sacking last night. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, has welcomed the recovery in UK factory growth last month:: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms are facing uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the EU but figures suggest exports are rising with a year-on-year increase of 15 per cent. This is partly a result of the weaker pound but also because more manufacturers are looking at new international markets beyond Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The news that BMW is planning to build the new electronic Mini at its plant in Oxfordshire is a timely vote of confidence in our industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s word-class expertise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers are planning positively for the future with continued investment, product development and new business at home and away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, reckons factories should contribute to growth this quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturers appear to be riding high going into the second half of the year with the sector in the UK and Europe continuing to be buoyed by a recovering global economy, alongside efforts to bring new products to the market. Above trend responses across the key components of the survey would signal that the drag on overall economic growth from the sector in the second quarter of this year is likely to be temporary. Boom! UK manufacturing has bounced back from its slowdown in June, thanks to a surge in new exports, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory PMI jumped to 55.1 in July, up from the three-month low of 54.2 in June. This was driven by foreign demand for UK goods, which rose by the fastest rate since the all-time record in April 2010. This came from clients in North America, Europe, the Asia- Pacific region and the Middle-East. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says UK manufacturing has started the third quarter of 2017 on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a solid footing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The headline PMI signalled a growth acceleration for the first time in three months during July, as new order intakes were boosted by a near survey-record increase in new export business. Although the exchange rate remains a key driver of export growth, manufacturers also benefitted from stronger economic growth in key markets in the euro area, North America and Asia-Pacific regions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued expansion is also still filtering through to the labour market, with the latest round of manufacturing job creation among the best seen over the past three years. However, there is a caveat! Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data is more upbeat than the official data from the Office for National Statistics, which showed that manufacturing shrank in April to June..... Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector slowed last month, but remains strong. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall healthcheck on manufacturers across the euro area came in at 56.6, down from the 74-month high of 57.4 hit in June. This is the 49th month running in which the factory PMI has come in over 50 points, indicating that the sector has now grown for over four years running. Encouragingly, the expansion seems to be widespread. Every individual country tracked by Markit reported factory growth, including Greece! Output growth dipped to a six month low, new orders grew at their slowest in five months, and new export growth was a four-month low. But all these readings were close to the best since 2011. As this chart shows, there are signs of a slowdown in some countries. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says eurozone factories were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buzzing with activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in July. The PMI came in slightly below the earlier flash estimate, slipping to a four-month low, but this is still an encouragingly buoyant reading. The survey indicates that manufacturing output was growing at an annual rate of approximately 4% at the start of the third quarter, sustaining the best growth spell that the region has seen for six years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany clearly remains a major driver of the upturn, with only neighbouring Austria and the Netherlands enjoying faster rates of expansion. But this is a broad-based revival nonetheless, with even Greece enjoying its first back-to-back monthly improvement in manufacturing conditions for three years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment growth meanwhile continued to run at one of the highest rates seen for at least 20 years, with the hiring boom underscoring the current ebullient mood within euro area factories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the near-record rise in employment, companies continued to struggle to meet order book growth, with capacity constraints both at factories and their suppliers becoming increasingly widespread in recent months. While price pressures eased in July, inflationary pressures could pick up again if demand continues to outstrip supply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector seems to have cooled a little in July. The German manufacturing PMI fell to 58.1 in July, down from 59.6 in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a very high reading, soaring over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. But it does show that output, new orders and job creation all softened. Trevor Balchin, Director, Economics at IHS Markit says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The German manufacturing sector finally gave up some momentum in July, with the PMI easing to a five-month low of 58.1. This was still indicative of marked overall growth, however, with rates of expansion for output, new orders and jobs remaining historically sharp. Supply chains in particular were kept under intense pressure at the start of the second half of 2017. The French recovery is alive and well! Firms took on staff at the fastest rate in 17 years, and optimism over future prospects hit a record high. This pushed France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI up to 54.9 in July, from 54.8 in June. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories had a decent July, with new orders accelerating but output growth slowing a little. They kept hiring workers too, according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI, but with the slowest increase in nine months. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector cooled a little last month, but is still growing: Factories in the Netherlands helped drive the eurozone recovery in July. The Dutch manufacturing PMI has climbed to 58.9 in July, up from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 58.6 and its highest reading since April 2011. New orders, output and employment levels all surged, suggesting that the sector strengthened last month. Over in the City, shares in Rolls-Royce have surged over 5% after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Underlying profits at the engineering firm jumped to \u00c2\u00a3287m for the last six months, up from \u00c2\u00a3104m a year ago. Strong sales of Rolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Trent engines helped it recover from the huge bribery scandal that rocked the firm. Millions of British Gas customers have woken up to the bad news that their energy bills are going up. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big rise too! Centrica is hiking its electricity prices by 12.5% but left gas prices unchanged. This means the average dual fuel bill will rise by 7.3% to \u00c2\u00a31,120. More than 3m customers will be hit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although Centrica will provide a \u00c2\u00a376 credit to more than 200,000 vulnerable customers to protect them from the increase. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Centrica boss Iain Conn just faced the music on Sky News, arguing that the rise is driven by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underlying increases in costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah-Jane Mee isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, though, telling Conn that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hoped to read out some of the comments received over social media, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not suitable for a family audience. She adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is one of the words I can read out..... China got manufacturing PMI day off to a solid start, by posting its best figures in four months. The Caixin China manufacturing PMI for July jumped to 51.1, up from 50.4 in June. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this also beats City expectations. Factory bosses reported that output and total new orders expanded at the fastest pace since February. In another encouraging sign, new export sales rose at the second-fastest rate for nearly three years. That could bode well for global growth. But.... Chinese manufacturers also shed jobs last month, at the fastest rate in 10 months. That meant that the backlog of unfinished work stacked up.... Dr Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says the data is encouraging: Operating conditions in the manufacturing sector improved further in July, suggesting the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth momentum will be sustained. That said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that financial regulatory tightening will be relaxed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery on firm foundations? We find out today, when the first estimate of eurozone GDP for the second quarter of 2017 is released. Economists are expecting to see solid growth, with GDP perhaps expanding by 0.6% in April to June. If so, that would broadly match America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, and be twice as fast as Britain. We also discover how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories fared in July, as data firm Markit rolls out its monthly PMI surveys. They may show that eurozone manufacturing hit a six-year high last month, and that UK growth picked up too. European stock markets are expected to open higher, with the FTSE 100 called up 0.5%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a blizzard of corporate news; engineering group Rolls-Royce, oil giant BP, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and energy group Centrica are all reporting results. And over in Threadneedle Street, staff at the Bank of England are starting a three-day strike in a pay dispute.

                "bodyText":"Over in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be hitting new heights, but European markets are not in the same buoyant mood. In the UK the FTSE 100 has fallen back, not helped by disappointing results from Standard Chartered and Rio Tinto. European shares continued to slip on the strength of the euro, itself partly due to the weak dollar which has helped push up the Dow. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 12.23 points or 0.16% at 7411.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.57% to 12,181.48 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.39% 5107.25 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 21,573.61 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.69% at 10,513.9 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.01% to 826.02 On Wall Street the Dow - having hit a new peak of 22,036.10 - is currently up 0.1% at 21,986. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV: Hopefully 22 becomes a floor rather than a ceiling....there is cash on the sidelines, returns on that are low, bonds are sitting there doing not much, and earnings are coming through. So stocks are the story. Oil prices are sliding after new figures showed that US crude stocks fell by less than expected last week. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stockpiles dropped by 1.53m barrels to 481.89, lower than the 2.96m decline expected by analysts. But gasoline stocks fell by a higher than forecast 2.52m barrels. The figures suggested a drop in demand even as oil producers continue to try and limit demand. Next week Opec and non-Opec producers are due to meet to discuss supply issues, with the background of US shale producers continuing to ramp up to make up for any shortfalls. The latest EIA figure saw Brent crude, which was up 0.27% at $51.92 a barrel just ahead of the announcement, slip 0.7% to $51.42. Back with the Dow, and here are the biggest movers so far (and the Apple effect is evident): And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another thing which may knock markets back. According to a professor at the Schulich School of Business, the first total solar eclipse in 38 years, set for August 21, could be a bad day for stock markets. Professor Mark Kamstra said research showed that weather-related psychological states, such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), could cause heightened risk aversion by investors. The study found that stock market returns in countries around the world are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly related to the amount of daylight through the fall and winter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So basically the solar eclipse could have a similar effect. Kamstra said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Historically, solar eclipses have inspired great fear, and, even today, some superstition remains for many people, so the markets can expect some fallout,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You have been warned. The rally may not last, however. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at ETX Capital, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the fastest 1,000 point run \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken a lot longer than the 24 sessions it took to get from 20k to 21k \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indicative of a bull market speeding to a top. The Dow is now up more than 11% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up more than 18%. But August is usually not a great month for stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 5 times in the last 20 - so there is caution about how long this can be sustained beyond earnings season euphoria. And he added: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just Apple - earnings are delivering across the board for US equities. Whatever is happening in Washington is not bothering the stock market. It is hitting the dollar of course. A lack of any fundamental moves in bond spreads suggests the recent dollar swoon is largely politically-driven. A weaker buck is good for US stocks and increasing doubts about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to raise rates quickly is also supporting equities. The punch bowl is still half full. The Dow has been hitting new highs despite the turmoil in Washington, with President Trump unable to enact his healthcare reforms while facing continuing questions over Russian involvement in the election, not to mention the shock departures of several of his key staff. It is recent positive set of company results which has taken investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds off the Trump turmoil, with Apple shares providing the final flourish with an opening 5% rise to a record $159 after its figures. A weaker dollar - thanks to the growing likelihood the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates again in the near future - is also helping lift shares in exporters. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Investors are completely immune to all the drama which is taking place over in Washington because if you look at the performance of the Dow, it appears everything is hunky dory. Although one can never underestimate the possibility of the president getting impeached but again that could mean more favourable trade relations with other countries and things moving back to normal. Thus, the impeachment trade itself could be positive for the equity market after a knee jerk reaction as the Trump trade would unwind. In earnings, it is all about Apple. The firm comfortably topped its forecast and produced stellar numbers for its revenue and profit. The big news was about the production of iPhone 8, the flagship product for the firm will hit the market on time with no issues around production. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has broken through the 22,000 barrier for the first time, boosted by a host of positive corporate earnings reports, the latest being Apple. If the Dow does hit 22,000 for the first time today, Apple won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the only one taking the credit... The ADP employment report is out and has come in below forecasts. Private sector employment increased by 178,000 in July, weaker than the 185,000 predicted by economists. However, the number for June was revised up sharply to show a 191,000 increase in jobs, compared with an earlier estimate of 158,000. The services industry accounted for the vast majority of new jobs in July: Traders at spread betting firm IG are predicting the Dow Jones will open just shy of the 22,000 mark when Wall Street opens: Time for a market update. Major markets across Europe are in the red, with the FTSE 100 extending losses, and now down 29 points at 7,395. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,395 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 12,213 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.1% at 5,121 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 21,580 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,534 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 379 Investors await the bell in Wall Street, where the Dow could surpass 22,000 for the first time. Investors are braced for the latest decision on interest rates from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, which will be delivered at noon tomorrow. Although markets have brought forward expectations for the timing of the first rate hike since July 2007, economists polled by Reuters don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think tomorrow will be the day. They are forecasting another split among MPC members - after a shock 5-3 split in June. This month two members of the committee are expected to vote for a rise in rates - to 0.5% from a current record low of 0.25% - while six are expected to vote in favour of no change. The pound is holding on to earlier gains against the dollar, up 0.3% at $1.3234, helped by a broadly weaker dollar. Sterling is now at a near 11-month high: Eduardo Gorab, property economist at Capital Economics, says the July construction PMI was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underwhelming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here is the data in chart form: Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the weaker than expected construction PMI shows Brexit uncertainty is weighing on commercial building: The sharp fall in the construction PMI in July suggests that the renewed slowdown recorded by the official data in the second quarter won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be short-lived. The decline in the PMI primarily reflected a big drop in the commercial activity index to its lowest level since immediately after the EU referendum. Commercial clients reportedly delayed decisions due to worries about the economic outlook and elevated political uncertainty. The adverse impact of Brexit uncertainty on commercial work likely will grow if, as we expect, exit talks progress slowly. Indeed, more firms will activate Brexit contingency plans as the Article 50 deadline draws closer, freeing up office space and sapping demand for new commercial projects. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club: Weakened economy activity, a lacklustre housing market and appreciable economic and political uncertainties threaten to be a damaging combination for the construction sector over the coming months. Meanwhile, construction companies are currently still being squeezed by elevated input costs. House building activity could be pressurised by extended slow housing market activity and subdued prices amid weakened consumer fundamentals. There is a risk that some companies may also be cautious about committing to major projects if there is any increase in level of uncertainty over the coming months. The detail of the July construction PMI survey shows reveals a sharp slowdown in commercial building such as offices as shops. Activity in that part of the sector actually fell. Growth in housebuilding meanwhile slowed, doing to little to raise hopes that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing shortage will be solved any time soon. The strongest area was civil engineering, where growth actually accelerated in July. The message from firms to appear one of waning confidence among clients, who were unwilling to commit to major spending decisions last month. Mike Chappell, managing director for construction at Lloyds commercial banking, is hoping July was a blip for the sector rather than the beginning of a broader trend. It has been a mixed month for the sector, so this dip in the reading is not a major surprise. The hope is that it is a blip rather than the beginning of a downward trend. Results from commercial contractors show margins are holding up reasonably well and improving. Meanwhile, any nervousness about pipelines has eased for many firms by the awarding of contracts for HS2. The principal headwinds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly input price inflation and concerns about the future supply of EU labour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remain, so the focus is on organic growth, continuing to boost margins to above the 2% mark and a disciplined approach to contract bidding. These priorities are still key if the industry is to mitigate the risks in the current trading environment. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI has come in a lot weaker than expected. The headline index combining output, orders and employment in the sector fell to 51.9 in July, from 54.8 in June. Anything above 50 signals growth. Economists polled by Reuters predicted a much smaller dip in the headline number to 54.5. Tim Moore from IHS Markit: July data reveals a growth slowdown in the UK construction sector, mainly driven by lower volumes of commercial development and a loss of momentum for house building. Worries about the economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty were key factors contributing to subdued demand. Construction firms reported that clients were more reluctant to spend and had opted to take longer in committing to new projects. More soon. The dollar is under further pressure this morning, as political drama in the US continues to unfold. The dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss is the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gain, with sterling nearing an 11-month high. The pound is up 0.3% against the US currency, at $1.3234, and the euro is also up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.1839. Apple shares hit a fresh record hight on Tuesday after the US tech giant announced it had sold 41m iPhones in the last three months. Investors were also reassured as Apple suggested rumours of a delay to the launch of the iPhone 8, due in September, were incorrect. Read our full story here: The FTSE 100 is off 19 points this morning, with commodity stocks dominating the list of the biggest fallers: Commodity shares are down on lower oil prices, with the Brent crude down 1% this morning at $51.29 a barrel. Rising US stocks of oil added to concerns about oversupply, pushing prices down. Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed that US crude stocks rose by 1.8m barrels to 488.8m in the week ending 28 July. Markets in Europe are mixed this morning. Shares have failed to get any major boost from the Apple-led tech rally that drove Wall Street higher on Tuesday. The scores so far in Europe: FTSE 100: -0.3% at 7,405 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 12,266 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.3% at 5,113 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 21,624 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,577 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 380 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We have some upbeat predictions for the UK economy this morning, as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research publishes its latest set of forecasts. Economists at the thinktank predict growth will accelerate to 1.9% in 2018 from 1.7% this year. They believe the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote will give that long-awaited boost to exports. As a result of stronger growth, NIESR says policymakers at the Bank of England will be ready to vote for a rise in interest rates in the spring. Previously they predicted the first rate hike would come after the second quarter of 2019, when Britain had left the European Union. Jagjit Chadha, the institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, says rate rises from the current all-time low of 0.25% will be a slow process: We are not talking about a rapid return to higher interest rates, but signalling that process \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if it takes five to seven years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will help banks rebuild their balance sheets and create a healthier financial system. Here is our story on the NIESR forecasts: Also today we have the latest healthcheck on the UK construction sector at 9.30 with the publication of the latest PMI survey. It is expected to show a slight dip in growth in the sector in July. At 13.15 the ADP employment survey for July will provide the latest insight into the US jobs market.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has beaten expectations by creating 209,000 new jobs in July. An upbeat Non-Farm Payroll report also showed the jobless rate has fallen to 4.3%, while annual wage growth remained at 2.5%. The labor force participation rate picked up too. Here are the details Economists broadly welcomed the news. As Michael Pearce of Capital Economics put it: The real economy remains on a strong growth path at the start of the third quarter. If the labour market continues to tighten over the coming months, as the survey evidence suggests it will, the Fed will raise rates again later this year. Many of the new jobs were low-paid, though, while manufacturing continued to shrink as a share of the economy. Wall Street cheered the NFP report, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a new all-time high. Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After seven straight record closes, the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid US jobs data has been balanced rather than breathless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with much of the cheerleading left to President Trump. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But nevertheless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much to be reassured by in this comprehensively strong jobs print. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes the headline figures are impressive, both on the job creation and unemployment rate fronts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the details are arguably more important \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the participation rate is creeping up as more Americans return to work, and average wages continue their solid upward progress. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With more Americans working, and more Americans earning more, the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer-led growth remains firmly on track \u00e2\u20ac\u201c powering equities into a sustained bull run. The dollar is also staging a recovery. It has now surged by 1% against the euro after hitting its lowest level since January 2015 this morning. Donald Trump welcomed the figures on Twitter (where else?....). And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The dollar is continuing to rebound strongly, putting worries about the Russian probe to one side. The greenback has hit a one-week high against the Japanese yen, at \u00c2\u00a5110.99. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also at a four-day high against the euro: Jameel Ahmad, VP of Corporate Research at FXTM, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report has lifted the dollar. Those hoping that the US dollar would be thrown a lifeline may be in luck, following the news that the United States added another 209,000 jobs to its economy in July This is an overall positive employment report and highlights the underlying strength of the US labor market. Figures exceeded expectations, with earlier projections sitting at 183,000 and wage growth, with average earnings rising by an annualised 2.5%, being further good news for the US Dollar. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in New York. Wall Street traders piled into stocks as soon as the opening bell rang, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. This pushed the Dow up by 62 points, or 0.28%, to 22,088 points. Investors are encouraged by the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created 209,000 new jobs last month, or almost 30,000 more than expected. The pick-up in monthly wage growth, from 0.2% to 0.3%, has also cheered the markets. Employment site site Indeed.com have sent over a handy chart, showing how many of these new jobs were relatively poorly paid... ....and another one showing how the US factory sector continued to shrink. Indeed Chief Economist Jed Kolko says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a banner jobs report. With the strong payroll number in July, job growth in the past three months is ahead of the 2016 pace and way ahead of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed to keep up with population growth. Working-age adults are now more likely to be employed than at any time since the recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although wage growth remains stuck at 2.5%, the changing industry mix might be holding wage growth back. Low-wage industries grew fastest in July, led by leisure and hospitality. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping the least-educated Americans get back to work. The recovery is now strong and long enough to lift many of the people hurt most by the recession -- except in manufacturing, which continues to lag overall jobs growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat tweet failed to mention that the US labor market has been creating jobs steadily for years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report is pretty robust, but it also extends a long trend of job creation and moderate wage growth. Ranko Berich of Monex Europe has tweeted this chart, showing monthly NFP figures (in blue) and the rolling average (in green). Berich adds that the dollar will probably remain under pressure, despite its rally in the last 50 minutes... \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe move is not yet anywhere near large enough to suggest the greenback\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless downwards trend of the last few weeks has been challenged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erik Norland, Senior Economist at CME Group, has calculated that total pay growth remained steady in July. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Non-farm payrolls grew by 209,000 in July, 29,000 better than consensus, while average hours earnings advanced by 2.5%, beating consensus by 0.1%. These numbers are very strong. Meanwhile unemployment fell back to its 17 year low of 4.3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What this means is that total labour income in the US grew by 4.3%, very much consistent with its pace of growth since 2010. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report: The US economy added 209,000 new jobs in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second month in a row of 200,000 plus jobs growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, a 16-year low. Economists had forecast the US would add 180,000 jobs in July, in line with the average monthly gain for the last six months. The latest jobs news will come as a welcome relief for Donald Trump, who was elected on the promise of rebuilding the US jobs market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excellent Jobs Numbers just released,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the president tweeted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the president heralded the announcement that Toyota and Mazda would soon be adding 4,000 new jobs at two new US plants. However, the jobs report showed once again that the majority of gains were in low-paying service industries. Jobs in food services and drinking places rose by 53,000 in July. The industry has added 313,000 jobs over the year. Healthcare employment increased by 39,000. Job growth in higher-paid sectors including construction, manufacturing and mining was marginal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: President Donald Trump didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste any time in welcoming today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figures, and taking credit for them too.... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-breaking run of job creation continued in July, points out economist Rupert Seggins: Alan Krueger, who chaired President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council of economic advisors, says the NFP report doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contain any nasty surprises. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid for the economy. It says the recovery is continuing at the same pace as before. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from the jobs report: Private sector jobs: Up by 205,000, compared with 194,000 in June Government jobs: Up by 4,000, compared with 37,000 in June Factory jobs: Up by 16,000, compared with 12,000 in June Goods-producing jobs: Up by 22,000 Construction jobs: Up by 6,000 Retail: Up by 900 Kully Samra, UK managing director at investment group Charles Schwab, says July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report confirms the strength of the US economy. And that means the US central bank is likely to raise interest rates again before Christmas, Samra says. Sustained labour market strength will likely mean that the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates for a third time this year and announce a plan to start its balance sheet reduction plan, despite a recent ebb in inflation pressures. This healthy set of figures should bolster labour market buoyancy and goes some way to suggest that there is momentum in the economy to generate some inflation, even though price pressures still remain moderate. With US stocks drifting along near record highs, this latest jobs report bolsters our view that the US economy remains in robust shape as we continue in this long-term bull market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another encouraging sign, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor force participation rate has risen to 62.9%, from 62.8%. That suggests that people are returning to the jobs market. On an annual basis, US earnings grew by 2.5% in July. That matches June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, and is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd result, according to James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute: The dollar is rallying back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, as traders welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No-Farm Payroll report. This has sent the euro down 0.25% to $1.184, and the pound down to $1.311. Average earnings in the US economy grew by 0.3% in July, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows, up from 0.2% in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another encouraging sign, although workers might hope for stronger wage growth at this stage of the economic cycle. Breaking! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created 209,000 new jobs last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than most economists had expected, and suggests the US labor market is still recovering. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll has been revised higher too - to 231,000 jobs, from 222,00 originally. Plus....the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.3%, from 4.4%. More to follow... Tension is mounting in the markets ahead of the Non-Farm Payroll report. The US dollar is hovering at $1.1870 against the euro, close to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two and a half-year low. Forecasts for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll range from a modest 175,000 extra jobs to a robust 220,000. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the final major economic news of the week - America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll for July. The NFP will tell us how many new jobs were created in the US last month (excluding hirings in the volatile agriculture sector), how much workers got paid, and whether people entered or left the labour market. Payroll forecasts vary widely, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a volatile measure (which is why financial types play a game of trying to guess the number each month, with limited success). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the consensus expectations for the data, due at 8.30am East Coast time or 1.30pm in London. NFP: Up by 183,000, compared with 222,000 in June Unemployment rate: Down to 4.3%, from 4.4% in June Average earnings (monthly): +0.3%, up from 0.2% in June. Although the job creation number may dominate the headlines, investors may be more interested in the wage growth figures. Earnings, and inflation, will determine how fast the US Federal Reserve can raise interest rates over the coming months. Kathleen Brooks of spreadbetting firm City Index explains: We believe that the wage component, which we do not forecast, will be the most important piece of data from the labour market report on Friday. If wages only rise by the expected 0.3% on the month, the annual rate is expected to weaken a touch to 2.4% from 2.5%, then it is hard to see how the dollar could stage a meaningful rally, as weak wage growth is likely to hinder the chances of a further rate hike from the Federal Reserve later this year. The US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness, and general nervousness, is keeping the gold price near a seven-week high today. Bullion is changing hands at $1,268 per ounce, up slightly today, and close to the highest level since mid June. That means gold is on track to gain 1% this week, adding to the 2.2% increase in July. Warren Patterson, analyst at ING, says: (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its the same trend we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen for the last month. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no change. Its mainly a dollar story.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx predicts more pain for the dollar today, if July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figures are a disappointment. He writes: Analysts are expecting the headline non-farm figure to shrink from 222k [new jobs] to 182k month-on-month, but with the unemployment rate falling back to 4.3%. Wage growth, meanwhile, is set to remain rather flaccid, with forecasts of a 0.3% increase in July compared to the 0.2% jump in June. If accurate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and remember, those non-farm estimates have a tendency to be way off base \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it could be another difficult day for the dollar, continuing the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summer from hell. Plus, of course, we could see more revelations around the Russia inquiry. Any suggestion that the situation is becoming more serious for the White House would probably spook the markets. The US dollar is on track for its fourth weekly loss in a row, unless today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data is strong enough to spark a rally. Bloomberg says: The dollar index is headed for a fourth straight weekly decline after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a federal grand jury in Washington to help his probe into Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion. Investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic over the news that the UK government is reviewing Help to Buy, says Anthony Codling of Jeffries. Codling reckons the scheme will simply be tweaked, to encourage more smaller homes to be built, rather than sunk altogether. There is speculation in Property Week that the UK Government is seeking to scale back Help to Buy. Our view is that the Government will do nothing which could lead to a reduction in housebuilding volumes. We believe that around two thirds of Help to Buy sales did not need help to buy, rather homebuyers used the scheme to purchase a bigger home. Focusing Help to Buy on First Time Buyers who need it is sensible, in our view. Housebuilders may need to build more 3 bed homes and fewer 5 bed ones, but, in our view, such a change in density may lead to a rise rather than a fall in housebuilder returns. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a subdued mood in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets this morning, with the main indices broadly flat. Investors seem to be keeping to the sidelines until the US jobs report has landed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The exuberance of yesterday appears to have been left behind this morning, with the FTSE retreating into a risk-conscious period of consolidation, given the unpredictability ahead of us. UK housebuilders are having a particularly bad, following a report that the government could end its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHelp To Buy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scheme early. Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development are all down 3.5%, even though the government has denied that the scheme - which helps first-time buyers - is being wrapped up. The US dollar continues to bob around a 15-month low, as traders get ready for the US jobs report in three hours time. Concerns over the US political situation continues to weigh on the dollar. Commerzbank strategists explained to clients this morning that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is becoming increasingly clear that the greenback is ...suffering as a result of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak government --the situation in the White House is simply too chaotic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means any hopes that arose after the elections andresulted in a sharp rise in inflation expectations have sincebeen dashed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in car sales last month shows that consumers are struggling, says Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club: Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Ed Conway is also concerned: Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association, fears that the slowdown in car sales could signal a wider weakness in the economy: Breaking! UK car sales fell over 9% in July, for the fourth month in a row. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed Brexit uncertainty for the decline, and is urging the government to provide clarity over its plans. According to the SMMT, 161,997 new cars were registered in the month as the market continues to fall. Car sales to businesses slumped by 23.8% year on year, while fleet sales were down 10% and registrations to private buyers fell by 6.8%. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says the auto industry desperately needs to know what Brexit deal Britain is aiming for: The fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock on effect on demand in the new car market and government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit. Diesel sales declined by 20%, following the recent emission scandal, while sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles, such as electric cars, surged by almost 65%. Hawes explains: While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see record achievements for alternatively fuelled vehicles, consumers considering other fuel types will have undoubtedly been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean air plans. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar weakness is part of a broader trend. The greenback has lost around 10% of its value since January, as optimism that Donald Trump might achieve tax reforms and infrastructure spending have faded. This chart, from CNN, shows how the US currency has had a rocky ride as investors lost faith, or patience, with the president. CNN says: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153White House soap opera\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has fueled the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline, according to Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence in the U.S. administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to deliver growth-boosting fiscal policies is at rock bottom,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Juckes wrote in a report this week. More here: The UK economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd better placed to withstand a small rise in interest rates according to Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England. Broadbent has been speaking a day after the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee left rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% and downgraded UK growth forecasts. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have got to recognise that changes in interest rates take time. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look just at what is happening now, we have to look at what might happen in the medium term. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that the economy will continue to grow, we think that wage growth will pick up. I think there may be some possibility for interest rates to go up a little bit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadbent suggested there was light at the end of the tunnel for cash-strapped consumers, whose incomes are being squeezed as prices rise faster than wages: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think inflation will peak in the second half of this year. We expect... wage growth over the next three years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dark morning for staff at educational publisher Pearson, as it announces plans to cut another 3,000 jobs.... Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed it is planning to create a new hub in Amsterdam, to help it cope with Brexit. Shares in the taxpayer-owned bank have jumped by over 4% this morning, after it also announced it made a profit of almost \u00c2\u00a31bn in the last six month. Maybe the worst of over for RBS (although a likely fine from US regulators over its conduct before the financial crisis still looms...) The US dollar could weaken further today, if July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s American employment report fails to meet expectations. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga believes it will take something special to shake off the grand jury news. It has been another rough and rocky trading week for the Greenback as heightened political jitters in Washington weighed heavily on the currency.... The distressed Dollar is in need of a lifeline and it may take an extreme upside surprise in both headline job numbers and earnings to bring the bulls back into the game. The US dollar is under pressure this morning, after it emerged that a grand jury has been convened to examine that Russia meddled in the US presidential election. The dollar is languishing at a 15-month low this morning, and is close to its lowest level against the euro in over two years. Reuters reports: The dollar hovered near the 2-1/2-year-low against the euro touched earlier this week, pressured by signs that probes into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections are gathering pace. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unrelenting US dollar weakness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right now. And Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(Political) policy uncertainty in the U.S. I think has been the biggest driver of declines in the dollar recently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any positive effect from the election of President Trump I think at this point has been priced out. This comes after US media reported that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had set up the grand jury, as part of his inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. President Trump hit back last night, telling his supporters that there was a plot to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd them out of his leadership.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in the spotlight today as we find out how many new jobs were created in the US last month. July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that the US unemployment rate dipped back to 4.3% last month, with around 183,000 new jobs created. The earnings figures will be closely watched too. They may show that wages rose by 0.3% during the month, up from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing 0.2%. Although the Non-Farm Payroll is frequently revised, it is a good insight into the health of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. President Donald Trump famously promised to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This might not be the first thing the history books remember him for, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures could show if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivering on that pledge. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, expects a strong report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our models point to an above-consensus gain of 200,000 or better in July. This aligns well with the quick job creation in June and other measures of labour market health that abound in the U.S. However, we are aware that there is a slight undercurrent of decelerating job creation over the past few years that will probably extend on a trend basis into the future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a natural function of an aging cycle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US economy created jobs steadily under president Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch, as this chart reminds us: In the City, Royal Bank of Scotland, publishing group Pearson and theme park operator Merlin Entertainment are all reporting results.

There was an initial spike following his election as infrastructure companies boomed on hopes of big government spending contracts, and wealthy investors and corporations gambled that he would hand out eye-watering tax cuts.</p> <p>But more important has been the action of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. This year, despite two small rate rises, the signs are that a return to anything like normal interest rates is a long way off.

Surveys of the manufacturing and services sector for July and the latest monthly labour market data illustrate the buoyant state of the economy, with all three expanding. But most indicators show consumer spending is losing its power and that eight years of vigorous expansion is drawing to its conclusion.

The budget is a mix of tax cuts for the richest and middle-income groups coupled with deep cuts in further education and welfare spending.

Imports fell slightly. Importantly, the deficit in the trade of goods with China fell by 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted $30.1bn. Trump is credited with a boom in coal exports and a commitment from companies like Apple to bring back factories to the US when they invest in their next generation of phones. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, along with those of most tech firms, were among the highlights of the recent reporting season. But the main reason for these numbers are improving global trade links, after a recovery from lows seen in 2015. While Trump may appear to be a huge political risk to smooth trade flows, the situation at the moment is calm and supporting improved global growth. Trump could have his moment to boast as a result of his upcoming budget, which promises a huge cut in corporation tax from 35% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the highest headline rates in the G20. Scepticism that a cut can be agreed in Congress is rife, not least because Barack Obama was unable to push through similar reductions. Nevertheless, just the prospect of budget handouts has lifted the spirits of average Americans. Unlike in the UK, where consumer confidence has fallen back to levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, Americans last week started feeling much more confident about the economy, pushing the Bloomberg consumer comfort index to a seven-week high. The rising stock market, rather than anything Trump said or did, was credited with the confidence boost, especially among those earning more than $75,000. Daco says he is concerned that after several years when consumers spent within their means, the income and spending trends started diverging last year. He blames a greater reliance on credit, especially to buy cars, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153savings dip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has seen consumers run down deposits to fund spending. The latest data shows the personal savings rate at 3.8% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much lower than the pre-revision level of around 5% and down about 2 percentage points since the start of 2016. Trump was having none of it on Friday, retweeting his fans. One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Republican Senators who are opposing the President, look at the great economic news: Americans Are Noticing!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Verdict One of the few certainties is that corporations and wealthy company bosses will prosper under a Trump presidency.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, after a quiet session, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has closed at a seven-week high. Mining stocks led the mini-rally, thanks to the jump in metal prices earlier today. The drop in the pound also helped exporters, but bookmaker Paddy Power shed around 5% after announcing its CEo was stepping down. The French market was flat, though, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX finished down 0.33%. Over in New York, the Dow Jones could be on track for its ninth record closing high in a row, after rising at the open. David Madden of CMC Market explains: The Dow Jones hit another record-high as the bullish sentiment is not showing any signs of slowing down. The US equity benchmark was on a roll last as it was racking up fresh record-highs, and the better-than-expected jobs report was the icing on the cake That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Rating agency Fitch has revised up its 2017 and 2018 world GDP growth forecasts. It now expects the global economy to grow by 3.0% this year, up from 2.9% in June, accelerating to 3.2% in 2018 (from 3.1%). Brian Coulton, Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says the global picture looks brighter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The revisions are led by emerging markets and China in particular, whose recovery has been more pronounced than anticipated. But data continue to suggest a synchronised global expansion across both advanced and emerging market economies. Spill-overs from the rebound in emerging market demand are reflected in the fastest growth in world trade since 2010\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However.... Fitch is concerned that the UK economy is faltering, and expects further weakness as negotiations with Brussels intensify. It says: The slowdown in the UK since late 2016 was confirmed with the 2Q17 GDP release, revealing that growth remained subdued at 0.3%. Declining real incomes and a household saving ratio that is already at a 50 year low suggest that consumer spending will slow further. Brexit uncertainties will weigh heavily on investment this year and next. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has crept up to another record high. The Dow ticked up to 20,092 points at the open, a small gain of just 4 points, but leaving it on track for its ninth record rise in a row. Splat! The pound has just hit a 10-month low against the euro, in a blow to any holidaymakers who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got their spending money sorted yet.... Sterling has fallen by 0.5% agains the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1036, meaning one euro is now worth 90.6p. This has dragged the pound down to a five-month low against a basket of currencies.... The pound has been weak since the Bank of England decided not to raise interest rates last Thursday, and cuts its growth forecasts. Persistent worries over Brexit are also hitting sterling; today, the government has been denying reports that it could pay a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn bill to leave the EU. Global stock prices have crept up to a new alltime high today, as relief over last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent US jobs report lingers. Even in the age of budget airlines and cost-cutting, a pilot remains one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMust Have\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 items for a successful flight. But maybe not for much longer? Swiss bank UBS have created a stir this morning, by predicting that dropping the pilot could save billions of pounds. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snag; some passengers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to step into a plane flown totally by computer, with no-one in the cockpit in case things go wrong. My colleague Patrick Collinson has the details: Pilotless planes would save airlines $35bn (\u00c2\u00a327bn) a year and could lead to substantial fare cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if passengers were able to stomach the idea of remote-controlled flying, according to new research. Full-size cargo planes will be airborne without pilots by 2025, according to the report by the investment bank UBS, but it predicts it will take until the middle of the century before passengers have enough confidence to board pilotless planes. The savings for the airlines could be huge, UBS said. It estimated that pilots cost the industry $31bn a year, plus another $3bn in training, and that fully automated planes would fly more efficiently, saving another $1bn a year in fuel. More here: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait longer than expected before discovering how Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Athens has decided to stop releasing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates of GDP, and is going to hold back until it has more comprehensive data. This follows some wild swings between the two releases -- last quarter, the flash estimate plunged Greece into recession, before updated data showed the economy was actually growing. That sort of thing might keep me amused, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not great for investors or economists as they try to make sense of the situation Reuters has the details: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics service ELSTAT has suspended until further notice the release of flash quarterly estimates on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross domestic product because of divergences with provisional estimates, an official at the statistics service said on Monday. The move means that flash data will not be issued on August 14. Nationwide quarterly GDP data will be released on September 1, taking into account more information than the early indicator of the flash estimate. That quarterly figure, known as provisional data, can also be subject to revisions over time. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office is under particular scrutiny right now, after its former chief was convicted of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breach of duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last week. Andreas Georgiou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crime? Officially, for failing to tell the statistics agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board about the release of Greek fiscal data. Many experts, though, say Georgiou is paying the price for his efforts to improve Elstat, and making its data more reliable and accurate. As Yale professor Stathis Kalyvas puts it: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the UK house price slowdown: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is lagging behind the rest of Europe today, after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise fall in industrial output. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has risen to a seven week high, though, and is not far from its record closing high of 7,547 points. Mining companies are driving the rally in London, after a jump in commodity prices overnight. Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are all up over 1%, after Iron ore prices surged. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: New Chinese regulations over capacity curbs in the winter means that buyers are now pushing their demand forward somewhat, driving Chinese steel futures to their highest level in more than four years, while Iron Ore rose 7% overnight. Otherwise, the City is a little subdued. Foreign exchange markets are a particular snooze fest, with the pound hovering around $1.3050 Newsflash: Investor morale across the eurozone has dipped, as expectations for the future weaken. The Sentix investor confidence index dropped to 27.7 this month, down from 28.3 and slightly below expectations. Sentix, a market research firm, says that the eurozone economy seems to have peaked. Optimism in the US has dropped, while German sentiment has been hurt by the scandals in its car industry, it says. Jeremy Duncombe, director of the Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, is concerned that UK house prices are still unaffordable for many people, despite the recent slowdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Year-on-year house prices continue to creep upwards, in spite of political and economic headwinds. With prices still rising, first-time buyers are now on average having to save for over 11 years to save enough just for a deposit, and for those who are unable to save, they face staying in Generation Rent indefinitely. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender, Octane Capital, says lack of housing supply is holding prices up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market is in a steady but decisive slowdown mode. Only the lack of properties for sale is preventing the market from deteriorating more quickly. While the jobs market is strong, buyers are increasingly feeling the pinch due to stubbornly high inflation and low wage growth. Squeezed finances will invariably see new house purchases put on the back burner. At the higher end of the market, stamp duty has put countless transactions to the sword.... Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, reckons the UK housing market is cooling, but nothing more serious: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The speed of price growth has slowed substantially, and at a national level average prices are still flatlining rather than falling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But what growth there is is meandering and listless, with prices being propped up by record low levels of supply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the other side of the equation there is genuine buyer intent, and rumours that the government may review the Help to Buy scheme could add fuel to the fire as some hesitant buyers may be spurred into action by the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuse it or lose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Property expert Henry Prior has tweeted the key points from the Halifax report: Joshua Mahony of IG points out that house price growth has been weak for months; Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that prices are still rising faster than wages. Breaking! UK house prices growth has hit a four-year low. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey, just released, shows that prices in the three months to July were only 2.1% higher than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest annual rate since April 2013, down from a blistering 10% back in March 2016. House prices in the last three months were 0.2% lower than in the previous three months (February-April). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth quarterly fall in a row, and another sign that the economy is slowing. In July alone, though, prices rose by 0.4% compared with June. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax Community Bank, says demand for houses is dropping as people are hit by rising inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House prices continue to remain broadly flat, as they have since the start of the year. Prices in the three months to July were marginally lower than in the preceding three months, while the annual rate of growth has edged down from 5.7% in January to 2.1% in July; the lowest rate since April 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in the employment level by 175,000 in the three months to May helped push the unemployment rate down to 4.5%, the lowest since June 1975. However, this improvement in the jobs market has not, as yet, boosted wage growth, resulting in earnings rising at a slower rate than consumer prices. This squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand. More reaction to follow.... We also have worrying signs that British households are being squeezed again, as consumer spending falls again. My colleague Zoe Wood explains: Britons are slashing spending on new clothes, cars and foreign holidays, according to new figures that underscore the effect on consumer confidence of rising living costs and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Spending fell for a third consecutive month in July, according to Visa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer spending index, which it said was the longest-running slump since February 2013. The 0.8% year-on-year decline in July was worse than June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.2% drop, but not as steep as the fall of 0.9% in May. More here: One month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t equal a crisis. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Service points out that June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment follows a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very robust run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of growth this year. To suggest it marks a trend change would be extraordinarily premature, the more so given the post re-unification record high in the Ifo Business Climate. Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking. Economist Carsten Brzeski of ING says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too alarmed by these figures. He writes: As unexpected as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in industrial production has been, the German economy is still on track to post another strong quarter. Given the sound fundamentals, a month of weaker industrial data should only be like a rain shower on hot and humid summer day: a welcome refresher. [Frankly, some hot and humid days would be a welcome change for Britain right now...] But, Brzeski also warns that the ongoing scandals at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry could hurt the economy: The automotive industry is currently in the middle of structural changes; partly self-inflicted and partly stemming from external factors. To some extent, the industry is in a similar situation as the banking sector. In Germany, the self-inflicted part goes back to the diesel emission scandal and the latest antitrust allegations, while at the same time possible bans of diesel bans in cities have emerged, international competition for electric vehicles has increased and phenomena like car sharing could also put pressure on future automobile productions. The 1.1% drop in German industrial output in June is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot what the doctor ordered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says the Financial Times: It adds: Before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, German factories had been enjoying five straight months of growing output, driven by a robust economic recovery in the eurozone, rising consumer confidence in the bloc, and a brightening world economy. German stats office Destatis said investment goods production contracted 1.9 per cent, while consumer output was down 0.7 per cent in June. Energy production was up on the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has got the new week off to a disappointing start, reporting that factory output fell unexpectedly in June. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest decline this year. German industrial production fell by 1.1% during the month, dashing expectations of a 0.2% gain, and reversing May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% rise. The downturn was due to weaker construction output, as well as a dip in the production of intermediate, consumer and capital goods. This is the first decline this year, and potentially a sign that the powerhouse German economy is starting to lose momentum. But... this is only one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, so not a reason to panic. Output is still up strongly over the last quarter, by around 1.8%, so this could just be a monthly blip. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet shows how German output has been strong this year: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more reaction now... Otherwise, the diary is a little quiet, apart from a new survey of UK house prices from Halifax and a regular update on eurozone confidence. European stock markets are expected to open higher, with the FTSE 100 called up around 20 points.

                "bodyText":"As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so quiet, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap. Trade data from Germany and China have raised concerns that the global economy might have slowed somewhat this summer. Chinese imports and exports both grew slower than expected, at 11% and 7.2% respectively in July. Economists say it could be a sign that domestic demand is dipping. Germany also missed forecasts, with a 4.5% tumble in imports and a 2,8% drop in exports. However, this may be a blip after a good run of German data this year. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, has a good take: A notable slowdown from China is an indicator that something is amiss. For China, this is particularly concerning as it is engaging on a serious path towards emerging as the next global power house.... [On Germany]....As economists had expected exports to dip by 0.3% and imports to rise by 0.2%, the below par performance will once again ignite criticism that Germany is destabilising the global economy (and contributing to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes) by running such a large trade surplus. The data have investors little to get excited about, with the FTSE 100 now down 9 points and other markets similarly subdued. But MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gauge of global markets has hit a new record high, thanks to the long rally in US stocks. The pound remains vulnerably to Brexit concerns, sliding to a new 10-month low against the euro. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back if there are any major developments.... Over in Athens the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is mulling a full-scale government reshuffle over the summer, reports our correspondent Helena Smith Before departing on what close aides are describing as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short one-week\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd holiday this weekend, Tsipras is weighing up pushing ahead with a major cabinet reshuffle in the coming days. The makeover, well-placed sources say, depends almost entirely on the role the British-trained Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, will play in the next government. The Oxford-educated economist is liked by his interlocutors not least officials representing the international bodies keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat but is believed to want to want to move on after overseeing some of the most difficult bailout talks to date. The reshuffle is aimed squarely at boosting the leftist-led coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagging popularity ahead of the new economic year which traditionally starts when the prime minister opens the International Trade Fair in Thessaloniki in early September. Encouragingly for Tsipras, yields (or interest rates) on Greek two and ten-year bonds have dropped precipitously since negotiations were wrapped up. Investors are now looking to the autumn to see what decisions are made regarding mid-term debt relief that would make the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery sustainable. The global economy is still on a steady growth path, according to the latest heathcheck from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD has rounded up the latest economic data (Composite leading indicators, or CLIs), and concluded that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable growth momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd across the 35 advanced countries that make up the OECD area as a whole. However, it has also spotted thatBritain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing (having only grown by 0.5% this year). The OECD says: The CLIs continue to point to stable growth momentum in Japan, Canada and the euro area as a whole. Stable growth momentum is now also expected in theUnited States and Italy,while in the United Kingdom the CLI confirms the tentative signs of easing growth flagged in last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment. Prospects of growth gaining momentum remain unchanged for Germany and France, as well as for China and Brazil. Amongst other major emerging economies, the CLIs continue to anticipate stable growth momentumin India while in Russia tentative signs of easing growth remain. Sterling has slipped to its lowest level against the euro last October. The pound dipped by 0.14% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1032 in quiet trading, meaning one euro is now worth 90.63p. The euro has strengthened steadily in recent months, helped by signs that the eurozone economy is enjoying a good year. The pound, though, remains dogged by Brexit worries - and fears that Britain and Brussels will fall out over the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexit bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Overnight, Sir Simon Fraser, a former head of the Foreign Office, has claimed that the UK has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit absent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the early negotiations. London insiders deny that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re slacking; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out the truth soon, when the UK releases its position papers on a series of vital issues, including the Irish border and access to the single market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat chart showing the slowdown in Chinese trade growth last month. Joshua Mahony of IG adds: The morning has been all about trade data, with the two powerhouses of Asia and Europe going head to head, to equally disappointing effect. On the face of it, both German and Chinese trade improved, with their balance of trade improving further. However, this comes as a result of a disproportionately larger fall in imports than the drop in exports. Certainly a fall in imports and exports across two of the biggest industrial nations in the world is not a particularly bullish sign, yet according to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest World Trade Outlook Indicator, the WTO suggests that global merchandise trade growth will continue to strengthen in the Q3. Investors seem to be taking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade figures in their stride.... Newsflash: World stock markets have hit their highest ever levels, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally on Wall Street. The MSCI All-Country World Stocks Index has nudged up to 480.76 points, Reuters reports, helped by Dow Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of nine record highs in a row (and counting...) Bookmaker Paddy Power is having another rough morning. Shares have fallen 5% to their lowest level in two years, after the company revealed it might take a year to get its new CEO in place. Paddy Power announced yesterday that chief executive Breon Corcoran was stepping down, to be replaced by Peter Jackson, CEO of the UK arm of globalpayments business WorldPay Group. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one problem, Jackson has his hands full handling WorldPay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover by US rival Vantiv, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear when he can jump ship. Corcoran told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They recognise we both have 12 months notice periods and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the middle of the deal. Peter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming here, we all hope it will be sooner but equally it will be within six to 12 months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prospect of a 12-month hiatus hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased the City, especially as Corcoran says the company faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dynamic and highly competitive market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following its merger with Betfair. Lee Wild, Interactive Investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Equity Strategy, says Jackson has a fight on his hands, especially as the government is reviewing the whole gambling sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Picking Peter Jackson as CEO is a brave move when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re losing someone of Breon Corcoran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pedigree. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only held the hot seat at FTSE 100-listed Worldpay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK division since March, and Paddy Power Betfair needs strong leadership now more than ever. With wider industry issues at play here, the market is yet to be convinced it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right move. The company has struggled, losing up to a third of its value since the Irish bookmaker merged with the online gambling site 18 months ago..... Revenue growth of 9% and 21% increase in underlying profit was largely in line with expectations, but there are wider problems for Paddy Power Betfair and the sector. Translation: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet out there in the markets.... European stock markets are subdued this morning, as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures fail to cheer traders. In London the FTSE 100 dipped by 3 points or 0.04%. Yesterday Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index hit a seven-week high, but this morning is is being pulled down by mining stocks (following the Chinese import and export slowdown). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a double-dose of disappointing trade data. Germany has reported that exports shrank by 2.8% during June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly drop since August 2015, and ends a five-month run of growth. In another blow, German imports shrank by 4.5% during the month - the biggest drop since January 2009 when the world economy was sliding into recession. Economists had expected exports to dip by 0.3%, and imports to rise by 0.2%. This has driven Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21.1bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.3b in May, a 10-month high. That may intensify criticism that Germany is destabilising the global economy by running such a large trade surplus. The slowdown in Chinese trade growth last month has not pleased the City. Capital Economics fear that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could be cooling: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite an uptick at the end of the second quarter, trade growth now appears to be on a downward trend. In particular, the sharp decline in import growth since the start of the year suggests that domestic demand is softening,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the figures may show the global economy losing some momentum: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese trade data for July has got Q3 off to a slow start with imports only rising 11% a sharp fall from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17.2%, which raises some concerns that domestic demand may be softening. Exports were also a bit of a worry as they only rose 7.2%, below expectations of 11% and a fall from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11.3%. This would appear to suggest that while global demand is still positive it may well not be as strong as initially thought, which might be a concern further down the line if it suggests a start of a trend. David Scutt of Business Insider points out that imports of key commodities slowed in July: Crude oil imports stood at 34.66 million tonnes, down from 36.11 million tonnes a month earlier, while imports of iron ore slipped to 85.74 million tonnes from 94.7 million tonnes in June. Coal imports also dipped to 19.46 million tonnes, a four-month low. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to see Chinese export growth slowing: The numbers have painted a dull picture to start the third quarter of this year. It is important that global demand improves because that would imply that the world economy is healthy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global economy is in the spotlight today, as investors digest new trade figures from China and Germany. And China has disappointed the markets, by reporting that imports and exports both missed expectations in July. Chinese exports only grew by 7.2% per year last month (in US dollar terms), down from 11.5% in June, and below expectations of an 10.9% rise. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest growth since February, when Chinese industry was disrupted by the Lunar New Year festivities. Imports have also underwhelmed, rising by 11%. That sounds like a good performance, until you note that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 17.2% in June, and the weakest growth since December. Economists had expected growth of around 16.6%. This drove the Chinese trade surplus up to $46.74bn, the highest since January. This may show that global demand is cooling; just at the moment when central bankers in several advanced economies are pondering whether to tighten monetary policy and unwind their stimulus packages. The figures are just as discouraging if you price them in yuan, rather than US dollars, as economist Daniel Lacalle tweets: Otherwise, the day looks a little quiet with not much in the diary. There could be excitement on Wall Street, though, where the Dow has hit nine record highs in a row. Can it manage a 10th? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much hope of drama in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets, though; the main indices are all expected to dip a little. I guess the August lull may have arrived.....",

The technology industry would be particularly hurt, they warn.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The war in Syria has led to a 60% fall in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. The most devastating military conflict since World War Two, however, has been the Korean War (1950-53), which led to 1.2m South Korean deaths, and saw the value of its GDP fall by over 80%. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 South Korea accounts for around 2% of global economic output. A 50% fall in South Korean GDP would directly knock 1% off global GDP. But there would also be indirect effects to consider. The main one is the disruption it would cause to global supply chains, which have been made more vulnerable by the introduction of just-in-time delivery systems. Months after the Thai floods had receded in 2011 electronics and automotive factories across the world were still reporting shortages.</p> \n   <p>The impact of a war in Korea would be much bigger. South Korea exports three times as many intermediate products as Thailand. In particular, South Korea is the biggest producer of liquid crystal displays in the world (40% of the global total) and the second biggest of semiconductors (17% market share).

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market moves: Growing tension between the US and North Korea boosted the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, gold and government bonds as investors sought out traditional safe havens at a time of geopolitical uncertainty. Nervous trading marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the financial crisis on Wednesday, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that North Korea faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury like the world has never seen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if it continued to make threats against the US. Gold rose to its highest level in almost two months, while the Swiss franc increased by more than 1% against the US dollar and saw its biggest one-day gain against the euro in more than two and a half years. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won currency dropped 0.9% against the dollar. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Swiss franc is the safe haven of choice today as risk sentiment gets hit from escalating nuclear fears between the US and North Korea. Unsurprisingly, the yen, which is still the second best performer in the G10 foreign exchange space, is playing second fiddle to the Swiss franc due to Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proximity to the epicentre in Pyongyang.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares fell in Asian and European trading after Pyongyang responded to the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough language with a threat to launch a nuclear strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam. Tokyo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index had dropped 1.3% by the time European stock markets opened on Wednesday morning, with similar falls on the German and French bourses. The FTSE 100 ended 44.67 points lower at 7498.06. But the prospect of hefty losses on Wall Street stocks was averted when US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no imminent threat of war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that Americans could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep well at night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here: After a tense, and sometimes sodden day, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed for the day. Fears over North Korea wiped 0.6% off the blue-chip FTSE 100, with banks and mining companies among the fallers. There were steeper losses in Europe, though, with the French CAC losing 1.3% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 DAX down 1.1% Markets did recover from their lowest points, after US secretary of state Rex Tillerson told Americans they could sleep safely. But investors are still nervous, as Joshua Mahony of IG says: European stocks have stabilised after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear-fuelled deterioration in response to heightened fears of a US-North Korea conflict. Although the stock markets have regained some ground, concerns clearly remain over the potential of conflict, with US yields hitting a six-week low and gold and JPYUSD hitting near two-month highs. David Madden of CMC Markets reckons markets could remain edgy until the crisis is resolved. European stocks have suffered greatly today as traders were prompted to cut-and-run due to the escalating tensions between the US and North Korea. The stand-off between the two countries has encouraged dealers to dump stocks and seek safe haven investments like gold. While the two nations are at loggerheads, it is going to be difficult to imagine money flowing into stocks. Over in America, Wall Street is still in the red, with safe-haven stocks in demand. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 50 points, or 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has lost 0.5%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a break - but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back if anything dramatic happens... GW There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many precedents, fortunately, for how the financial world reacts to the threat of nuclear destruction. The best example is 1962, and the Cuban missile crisis. Capital Economics have dug into the data, and report that the early selloff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long: Although the S&amp;P 500 fell after US President Kennedy announced the discovery of missiles on Cuba, it had more or less recovered its losses before Soviet General Secretary Khrushchev announced six days later that the missiles would be removed from the island. And even the initial fall was very small compared to the declines in US equities earlier that year, which were not connected to the crisis There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief in the City that Wall Street hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered chunkier losses so far today. European markets are recovering some of their earlier losses, on hopes that the North Korea - US standoff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to real disaster. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: While the markets pulled back from their lunchtime losses, the US open couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convince investors to put their Trump/North Korea fears to one side. Though the Dow Jones largely managed to avoid the kind of drastic downturn seen by its European counterparts, it still fell 60 odd points after the bell, leaving the index just above the 22000 mark. For most of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure the Dow has left the dollar to deal with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constant policy disappointments, so it will be interesting to see whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop marks a change in direction for the record-breaking index, or if it is merely a knee-jerk blip exacerbated by an empty economic calendar. DING DING! The New York stock market has opened for the day with some losses, as investors follow Europe and Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 62 points, as the escalating tensions between America and North Korea loom over the trading floors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop of 0.3%, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses after Donald Trump warned North Korea to expect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if it made any moves against the US. Goldman Sachs have suggested that investors are actually more worried than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re letting on..... Capital Economics have calculated that the global economy would take a significant hit if armed conflict broke out between the US and North Korea. In a research note published today, they say: The most important impact of a full-scale conflict on the Korean peninsula would be a massive loss of life. But there would also be significant economic consequences. Those consequences include major damage to South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and a knock-on impact to supply chains around the globe. The technology industry would be particularly hurt, they warn. The war in Syria has led to a 60% fall in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. The most devastating military conflict since World War Two, however, has been the Korean War (1950-53), which led to 1.2m South Korean deaths, and saw the value of its GDP fall by over 80%. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 South Korea accounts for around 2% of global economic output. A 50% fall in South Korean GDP would directly knock 1% off global GDP. But there would also be indirect effects to consider. The main one is the disruption it would cause to global supply chains, which have been made more vulnerable by the introduction of just-in-time delivery systems. Months after the Thai floods had receded in 2011 electronics and automotive factories across the world were still reporting shortages. The impact of a war in Korea would be much bigger. South Korea exports three times as many intermediate products as Thailand. In particular, South Korea is the biggest producer of liquid crystal displays in the world (40% of the global total) and the second biggest of semiconductors (17% market share). It is also a key automotive manufacturer and home to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three biggest shipbuilders. If South Korean production was badly damaged by a war there would be shortages across the world. The disruption would last for some time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it takes around two years to build a semi-conductor factory from scratch. The impact of the war on the US economy would likely be significant, Capital Economics adds: At its peak in 1952, the US government was spending the equivalent of 4.2% of its GDP fighting the Korean War. The total cost of the second Gulf War (2003) and its aftermath has been estimated at US$1trn (5% of one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP). A prolonged war in Korea would significantly push up US federal debt, which at 75% of GDP is already uncomfortably high. The losses in the European stock markets are intensifying, as traders brace for further developments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest. Britain FTSE 100: down 62 points, or 0.8%, at 7480 points German DAX: down 182 points, or 1.5%, at 12,109 points French CAC: down 68 points, or 1.7%, at 4029 points Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if this is a knee-jerk reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war of words between the US and North Korea, or the start of a serious selloff after a string of record highs. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says the next few hours could be critical. By the close of the bell tonight we should have a good feel for sentiment one way or another. But as things stand, risk is definitely off the menu and if you-know-what hits the fan then things could turn ugly really quick. This is especially the case given the extent of the recent rally, which means there will be lots of stops resting below market. So, the downward move could gather pace due to technical selling. Money is pouring into US government bonds as New York traders reach their desks and pile into safe-haven assets. This has driven the price of these Treasury bills up, sending the interest rate (or yield) on the bonds down to their lowest levels in six weeks. The US president has weighed in again.... A quick look at the best-performing shares in London shows that investors are preparing for a potential conflict in Korea. Gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo have both jumped by 3%, following the surge in precious metal prices today. Weapons producer BAE Systems has also rallied, on the prospect of increased military spending on munitions, armoured vehicles and the like. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains: BAE Systems, the weapons and defence company, has managed to pick up off recent lows, and is 1.5% higher so far on Wednesday. We would expect US defence companies to also fair well on Wednesday with Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrup Gruman potential gainers from the escalating geopolitical situation with North Korea. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest explainer: European banks are bearing the brunt of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The sector has fallen by 1.8% today, on track for its worst day in three months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the answer to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s question about how Brexit is making it harder to regulate the City of London: The financial markets could suffer sharp losses if the US and North Korea don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t calm the situation. So says Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro &amp; fixed income research at investment bank Exotix Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The North Korean threat has been present in one form or another for some time, and despite periods of nervousness, markets generally have not tended to focus on it too much. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, with the tension between the US and DPRK reaching a level that appears somewhat unprecedented in the last decade, if not longer, the question is whether this time is different. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Time will tell, but markets may look to safe haven assets if things escalate. The best hope is for all parties to return to the negotiating table. More from Rex Tillerson, who is trying to give US citizens some early morning reassurance (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 7.30am on the East coast): Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has told Americans not to panic about an imminent attack from North Korea. Although European and Asian stock markets have been hit by North Korean fears today, the US stock market is expected to open fairly calmly. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by 30 or 40 points, so only a small dip. However the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index, the VIX, has jumped to its highest level in a month - showing that investors are anxious. North Korea isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only thing worrying investors today Investors are also spooked by reports that a car has ploughed into a group of French soldiers in Paris this morning. Joshua Mahony of IG says geopolitical worries are driving the markets. European markets are trading in the red this morning, as the risk aversion caused by further confrontation between the US and North Korean was exacerbated heightened by another attack taking place in Paris.... A week of low volatility has been hit with an unexpected rush to safe havens as the US-North Korean feud has ratcheted up once more overnight. No sooner had Trump warned of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the event of further threats from North Korea, than the breakaway nation responded with exactly just such a threat, announcing plans for a potential attack on the US airbase in Guam. The unpredictable nature of North Korea means it is hard to gauge exactly how likely an attack is, yet given the military power of both nations, there is no surprise we are seeing markets shift out of risk assets and into havens such as the yen and gold. With the height of the 2007 crisis falling 10 years ago, the threat of a nuclear conflict represents the best chance we have of another market crash. Safe money havens such as the Swiss franc have received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a booster shot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the US-North Korea crisis, says Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank. This chart shows how the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSwissie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is the best-performing major currency against the US dollar today. The Bank of England has also announced it will appoint a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconflicts of interest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 officer. It follows deputy governor Charlotte Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock resignation from the BoE this year, after she failed to report that her brother worked for Barclays bank. British companies are finding it harder to recruit staff, according to the latest report from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agents across the UK. But despite being in shorter supply, workers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting higher pay rises. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing, given the recent jump in inflation. The latest Agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summary of business conditions, just released, says: Recruitment difficulties had edged higher, and were gradually broadening across sectors and skill areas. Despite this, labour cost growth had been modest, with pay awards clustered around 2%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3%. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agents also found that UK companies only have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hiring intentions right now. Manufacturers are more focused on improving productivity and automating tasks, rather than taking on more staff, they add. Just in: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained at 1% last month, as the country continues to claw its way out of deflation. The selloff is gathering pace, as worries over potential military conflict between the US and North Korea grips the markets. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTS 100 is now down almost 60 points at 7481, a drop of 0.8%, extending its earlier losses. There are losses in France and Germany too, as traders fret that Donald Trump may mishandle the North Korea crisis, with potentially devastating consequences. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why the City is worried by last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Trump and the North Korean side. Rising tensions on the Korean peninsula are nothing new, they have been a staple for investors for several years now, but this flare-up has the potential for a policy misstep, more so because of the inexperience of the person occupying the White House, and a tendency to conduct policy by way of tweet and press conference. This may explain why financial markets have adopted a safety first approach to events over the last twelve hours. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from President Trump that North Korea would face \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury like the world has never seen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if they continued to threaten the US along with their attempts to build a nuclear warhead, that could hit the western US, brought an entirely predictable counter response from Pyongyang. The response that the North Korean nation was considering a missile strike on the US base in Guam was the equivalent of a two fingered response to the US President, and there is a danger that this war of words between two leaders with large egos could get out of control. Hindsight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful thing, so where should you have put your money 10 years ago as the financial sector began implode? Deutsche Bank has the answers - the American stock market, and high-yielding US debt. You should have kept well away from the Greek stock market, European banks, and oil. Hope that helps... We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a rerun of the 2008 financial crisis according to Sir John Gieve, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor for financial stability between 2006 and 2009. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a repeat of what happened 10 years ago because banks have far more capital, there are far more regulations on their liquidity and funding which was a big issue then, and of course they have spent the last 10 years dealing with the problems raised ... so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the exuberance that we certainly saw then.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gieve said that debt levels in the UK were more manageable now, but flagged up concerns about the situation in China: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the UK and most of the west the debt levels are more manageable now. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve yet to see how they will be affected by a return of positive interest rates, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had 10 years of super expansionist monetary policy and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve yet to see how we can get out of that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main debt which threatens a sudden break is probably in the far East and China which has been running a credit binge now for a decade and is showing signs of over extension.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat chart, showing how world stock markets have clawed back their financial crisis losses, but anyone holding bank shares is still nursing losses. Some banks are *still* dealing with the consequences of the crisis. Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, remains under taxpayer control and continues to negotiate with the US department of justice over misconduct in the run-up to 2007. Politicians have failed to obey Churchill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Never let a good crisis go to waste\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation. Bell writes that there was a great opportunity to reform the economy in the 10 years since the credit crunch, but it has been missed. After the second world war the Attlee government didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply try to undo the damage of the war. From the NHS to our national parks, it used the energy from that cataclysm to build a better Britain. Franklin D Roosevelt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Deal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply a response to the Great Depression, but a set of interlocking reforms aiming to build a fairer country. The financial crisis highlighted the big challenge of our time: to ensure the economy delivers for working people. Looking back over the last decade, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear we have far from delivered. With Brexit looming, a lot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed in our politics. But when it comes to our economy, things simply haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed anywhere near enough. Jack Lew, former US Treasury Secretary, has been reminiscing about the financial crisis to mark the 10th anniversary of the credit crunch. He told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme that in 2008 he was was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quietly advising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd future president Barack Obama on how to address the economic and financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never seen a situation where every single day numbers were so much different and worse than the day before that you literally had to come back and keep revisiting how much fiscal stimulus would the economy need in order to stimulate a recovery. Lew also warned that memories of the financial crisis may be starting to fade, and people may forget why some key reforms were pushed through. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all know that crises will come in the future, what we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know is when and how. What Wall Street reform did was for the first time since the Great Depression gave us the ability to have tools where we could deal with an evolving financial system to have the safeguards that we need. Even before this election you saw a great pushback amongst many, saying this has gone too far. I fear that as the memory of the Great Recession and the financial crisis start to dim, some of the simple nostrums about just clearing away regulation, start to take on salience as if the stakes were not so high in 2007/2008. Overnight, the Bank of England has warned that the task of regulating the City after Brexit will put a strain on its ability to police the financial sector. Like to know more? Let us know what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like answered and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do the rest.... The rising US-North Korean nuclear tensions have dampened appetite for risky assets like equities and industrial commodities, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Instead, safe assets like gold, silver, bonds, the Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc are in demand, he adds. One City worker reports that senior investors are taking steps to protect themselves from the risks of conflict between the US and North Korea PMs are portfolio managers, or someone who manages other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money European stock markets are a sea of red in early trading, with the main indices down around 0.5%. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The geopolitical tensions have prompted a risk off trade amid investors. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about North Korea have created nervousness and the fear is if the president really means what he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Japanese yen has hit an eight-week high against the dollar, as geopolitical worries hit the Asian markets. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, as the yen is a classic safe-haven in turbulent times. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves drove it up to \u00c2\u00a5109.74, from \u00c2\u00a5110.37 on Tuesday. Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief FX strategist at Daiwa Securities, says (via Reuters) that North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to attack the island of Guam has spooked traders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market had been complacent for a while regarding headlines from North Korea. So it reacted when the North threatened Guam, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Few participants, however, think that North Korea would actually strike Guam at this juncture. So the impact is likely to fade eventually.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning to North Korea also sparked a late sell-off on Wall Street last night. That meant the Dow Jones industrial average couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit its 10th record high in a row. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old saying in the markets that you should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy at the sound of cannons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mantra, though, is that you should sell when the president of the United States and leader of North Korea threaten each other with military conflict. Asian shares have been rattled overnight by the news that Donald Trump had told journalists in New Jersey that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump was responding to reports that North Korea had produced a miniaturised nuclear weapon that can be carried on its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). This move raises fears that Pyongyang could launch a pre-emptive attack on the US. As we reported last night: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the slightest doubt that the RVs on these missiles are working,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there. North Korea can put a nuclear weapon on New York City.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd North Korea swiftly responded to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, with reports that it was considering attacking the US Pacific territory of Guam, which is a significant US military base. This has a predictably bad effect on the markets, driving money into safe-haven assets such as US government bonds, and out of shares. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index tumbled by 1.5%, while South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi 200 index lost 1.25% as traders in Seoul watched events nervously. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a full-blown crash, of course, but investors do seem to be concerned by the escalating tensions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets have a mostly consistent risk-off tone overnight,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also expecting losses in Europe today, with the FTSE 100 being called down 35 points. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: North Korea has been a worry simmering in the background for a long time but with its more advanced weapons and Trump ready to act in the White House, it could bubble over anytime. The threat from North Korea seems to have jolted investors out of their summer slumber. This will also overshadow the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, which is being marked today. August 9th 2007 was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day the world changed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when central bankers began pumping money into the system, after French bank BNP Paribas barred investors from accessing money in funds exposed to subprime mortgages industry. That was the formal start of the credit crunch, which let to market mayhem, bank collapses, a global recession and the eurozone debt crisis. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking back at what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned since.

The drop in first-home buyers occurred across the nation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except for WA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where, due to the end of the mining boom, house prices have fallen by around 8% since the middle of 2014: The drop in the share of first-home buyers in NSW since 2012, however, is remarkable even compared to the second biggest market of Victoria. Since 2001 Victoria and NSW had had similar shared of first-home buyers but, in 2012, as the Sydney housing boom took off, the percentage of first-home buyers shrank in a manner not replicated in Victoria: While the hope for a soft landing, which does not see a collapse in the housing market (and with it a large section of our economy), the concern is that even a slowing of the market will do little to bring back first-home buyers. Interestingly, since the start of the housing boom, the size of the average mortgage of first-home buyers across all states except Tasmania has increased by less than has the size in the mortgages for non first-home buyers. A look at the average mortgage sizes in NSW shows that in 2013 the average non first-home buyer mortgage of $335,900 was just 4.5% bigger than the $321,500 average mortgage of a first-home buyer. Now, however, the average mortgage of a non first-home buyer in NSW is nearly 20% more than for a first-home buyer: But while the size of mortgages for first-home buyers has stayed steady around $367,000 since the start of 2016, the percentage of first-home buyers in the NSW market has fallen from 9% to 8%. This suggests that the problem is not so much that the prices of houses bought by first-home buyers has risen but that the number of houses first-home buyers can afford has shrunk. It would suggest that there is a ceiling that many first-home buyers hit of which there is not an equivalent for non-first home buyers. So while the market might be cooling, it would seem that first-home buyers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in Sydney \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be waiting some while before affordability is significantly improved.",

US intelligence agencies now believe North Korea can do this. The remaining challenge for the North is manufacturing a warhead that can survive the heat of re-entering the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere from space. However, North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complete dedication to its nuclear programme, combined with the accelerating progress of recent months, means that this final hurdle is likely to be cleared shortly.</p> <p> Mr Trump believes that the previous US policy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic patience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd failed because it permitted the development of the North\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missiles and warheads. But there is little indication that his bellicose rhetoric is intimidating North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. Indeed, so far as Kim Jong-un is strengthened by evidence of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to the North, it cements him in his position and justifies his own aggression.</p> <p> The danger in the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy of matching the North\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrill rhetoric is that the escalating threats lead each to assume the other is moving closer to an attack, until such a confrontation becomes inevitable. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes this risk remains low\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nuclear war would have catastrophic consequences\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut that it is rising in proportion to the strengthening of the rhetoric. The positions of two of the three of the main actors are clear. The North will continue to develop its nuclear weapons programme regardless of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats or any economic pressure generated by tighter international sanctions. China will recalibrate its trade and diplomacy with North Korea in line with UN sanctions, but will avoid instability. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is the most fluid. A pivot from aggression to containment is likely in the medium term, but the risk of an attack to attempt to damage North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military capabilities in the short term has risen again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-598c463ce4b0cd59a34da341\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-10T11:44:32.211Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/10/markets-north-korea-tensions-uk-trade-gap-factory-production-business-live?page=with:block-598c30f0e4b0cd59a34da2de#block-598c30f0e4b0cd59a34da2de\">The 2% jump in British exports to Europe in April-June</a> shows why we need a full trade deal with the EU after Brexit, says the Institute of Directors.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/895597004172271616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nice analysis of UK trade figures from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllieRenison\">@AllieRenison</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sdkBkWbYHp\">pic.twitter.com/sdkBkWbYHp</a></p>&mdash; Andy Bruce (@BruceReuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/895597004172271616\">August 10, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-10T12:18:50.189Z\">at 1.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-598c3837e4b0e6bf8f5907dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-10T10:50:37.750Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time.</strong></p> <p>New York traders will probably be cautious, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/10/north-korea-details-guam-strike-trump-load-of-nonsense\">North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threat, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcload of nonsense\u00e2\u20ac\u2122</a>. </p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down nearly 50 points,.

                "bodyText":"The increasingly tense confrontation between the US and North Korea has again sent investors fleeing from equities and into safer areas such as gold and government bonds. It was a down day across Europe, while Wall Street was also suffering from the growing uncertainty. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The showdown between the two nations has scared off many investors. Whenever dealers hear the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 they usually run for the hills, and that is exactly what we have seen today. While tensions are running high, traders will be reluctant to be long... US equity markets are holding up better than their European equivalents, but a global story like this will shake investors out of the stock markets. US equities, and in particular, the Dow Jones had a great run recently and the political uncertainly between the two countries has encouraged profit taking. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 108.12 points or 1.44% to 7389.94, wiping around \u00c2\u00a327bn off the value of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top companies and marking its worst one day performance since 18 April this year Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.15% to 12,014.30 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.59% lower at 5115.23 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.76% to 21,681.61 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.38% at 10,450.0 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.02% to 833.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 165 points or 0.74%, on track for its worst day since the end of June. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile the Vix volatility index has jumped 27% on the North Korea situation, hitting a three month high of 14.2. The fall in the FTSE 100 is due in the most part to the global concerns following the growing tensions between the US and North Korea, but there are other factors. For a start, some 40 points of the current 114 point or 1.52% decline is due to companies being quoted ex-dividend. Then there is the widening UK trade deficit, as well as news that the NIESR think tank had edged its growth forecast lower. And housebuilders have been hit by signs of the weakening housing market. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The housing market decline evident within London over recent months appears to be spreading across the country, with the latest report from RICS highlighting a slowdown in sales. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the London School of Economics and VATT suggested the recent stamp duty changes are having a significant negative effect on housing transactions, and today we are seeing that borne out in the RICS data. The continued slowdown we are seeing in house price growth and housing sales is proving a drag on the housebuilder sector, with Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey suffering heavily today. The market slide is continuing, as investors flee to safer areas given the tensions between the US and North Korea. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The US open did nothing to dispel the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tremulous trading, instead causing the European indices to intensify their own losses. The Dow Jones plunged more than half a percent after the bell, wiping off 130 points to leave the index teetering just above 21900. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its worst price since the end of July, raising questions of whether this is the end of the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent record run, or just a brief diversion until the US/North Korea situation cools and a parade of proper, Grade A data arrives (for example, next week is looking pretty jam-packed). The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop had serious implications for the rest of the global markets, as investors voiced their concerns about the nuclear threat posed by two very spoilt children. The FTSE is now down a whopping 1.6% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and while roughly third of that decline stems from a chunk of the index going ex-dividend, the rest certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Not only is the war of words (let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope their spat remains verbal) between Trump and Kim Jong Un weighing on the FTSE, but also the disappointment of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 9 month high UK trade deficit. There were similarly alarming slides in the Eurozone. The DAX gradually saw its losses widen to 130 points, sending the German index to a fresh 12 week nadir, while the CAC dropped 0.7% to lurk just above 5100. Opec has forecast higher demand for crude in 2018, and said a rise in the oil price suggested its moves to curb the glut of supply could be having an effect. In its monthly report, the oil producers organisation said demand next year would reach 32.42m barrels a day, up 220,000 from its previous prediction. The news has helped push Brent crude 0.9% higher to $53.19 a barrel. US markets have opened lower, with investors nervy amid the rhetoric from the US and North Korea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 79 points or 0.36% in early trading, pushing it back below the 22,000 level, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.43% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.65% lower. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is 1.26% lower and set for its worst day since mid-April. But around 40 points of the near 100 point decline is due to a number of major companies being quoted ex-dividend, when shareholders no longer have the right to the payout. Also from the US, producer price inflation came in weaker than expected, another suggestion that any imminent rate rise from the Federal Reserve is unlikely. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: US PPI comes in well below expectations, suggesting that there is little need for imminent additional policy tightening. Nonetheless, we still see some potential for higher inflation to year end. The US PPI report for July is surprisingly low, falling 0.1% month on month (consensus was looking for a 0.1% rise), which brings the year on year rate down to 1.9% from 2%. The market and ourselves had been looking for 2.2% or 2.3% year on year reading. Core (excluding food and energy) similarly fell one tenth of a point. This is the first month on month drop in the headline rate since August 2016 and on the face of it a suggests pretty benign inflation backdrop right now... It is a surprise because the building blocks pointed to a much strong reading. The combination of the 10% fall in the US dollar helping to nudge up import prices, rising commodity prices (such as oil, which rose 18% trough to peak between June and July) and the underlying strength in the manufacturing sector helping to give a bit more pricing power to producers. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s softer outcome suggests some downside risk for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI report, but with the economy growing reasonably and creating jobs in significant numbers, coupled with the factors we cited regarding PPI mean we still think inflation pressures will pick-up over coming months. Newsflash from America: The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen slightly. Around 244,000 new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial jobless\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claims were filed last week, up from 241,000 in the previous seven days. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a low figure, by historical standards, showing how the US labor market remains pretty solid. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, according to the latest estimate from The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research Research. If NIESR are right, that means that growth slowed in July, following 0.3% growth in April-June. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much slower than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trend growth rate, of around 0.5-0.6%, and dangerously close to stagnation. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We estimate that economic growth decelerated to 0.2 per cent in the three months to July, compared with 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2017. The service sector, which was the main driver for economic growth in the second quarter, appears to have slowed. We see a modest recovery in the second half of this year in response to strengthening global growth and a weaker currency, but on the flip side, consumer spending is likely to be weighed down by weak wage growth and investment spending held back by Brexit-related uncertainty. Further out, we see quarterly economic growth strengthen somewhat to 0.4-0.5 per cent as the economy rebalances away from domestic demand and towards net trade. Economic growth however, remains below its long-run average growth rate of 0.6 per cent because of subdued productivity growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mike Jakeman, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. argues that there is only a small chance that the United States and North Korea end up going to war. But while that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief, Jakeman also fears that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bellicose rhetoric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is dangerous, and could drive the two sides into conflict. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rhetoric between the US and the North has intensified over the past year, as evidence has mounted that North Korea is capable of attaching a miniaturised warhead to the top of an intercontinental missile. US intelligence agencies now believe North Korea can do this. The remaining challenge for the North is manufacturing a warhead that can survive the heat of re-entering the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere from space. However, North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complete dedication to its nuclear programme, combined with the accelerating progress of recent months, means that this final hurdle is likely to be cleared shortly. Mr Trump believes that the previous US policy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic patience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd failed because it permitted the development of the North\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missiles and warheads. But there is little indication that his bellicose rhetoric is intimidating North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. Indeed, so far as Kim Jong-un is strengthened by evidence of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to the North, it cements him in his position and justifies his own aggression. The danger in the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy of matching the North\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrill rhetoric is that the escalating threats lead each to assume the other is moving closer to an attack, until such a confrontation becomes inevitable. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes this risk remains low\u00e2\u20ac\u201da nuclear war would have catastrophic consequences\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut that it is rising in proportion to the strengthening of the rhetoric. The positions of two of the three of the main actors are clear. The North will continue to develop its nuclear weapons programme regardless of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats or any economic pressure generated by tighter international sanctions. China will recalibrate its trade and diplomacy with North Korea in line with UN sanctions, but will avoid instability. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is the most fluid. A pivot from aggression to containment is likely in the medium term, but the risk of an attack to attempt to damage North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military capabilities in the short term has risen again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 2% jump in British exports to Europe in April-June shows why we need a full trade deal with the EU after Brexit, says the Institute of Directors. The US stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time. New York traders will probably be cautious, following North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threat, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcload of nonsense\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down nearly 50 points,. That would drag it below the 22,000 mark, hit for the first time this month. Heightened geopolitical tensions will weigh on shares today, predicts Marketwatch: David Madden of CMC Markets reckons traders are on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcred alert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in case the situation deteriorates further. Madden adds: In tense situation like this, equity markets are move lower exceptionally fast, and investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be caught on the wrong side of the markets, so they are getting out now. Traders would require nerves of steel to starting buying into the stock market now, given standoff between the US and North Korea. Damian Green, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first secretary of state and effectively deputy prime minister, has urged the US government to use United Nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s processes to resolve the North Korea crisis after President Donald Trump threatened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against the Pyongyang regime. Green was asked by reporters on a visit to Edinburgh whether he thought Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric was unhelpful or wise given the escalating tensions. He replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the sensible way for people to proceed now is to work through the UN process: that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the British government has been supporting and will continue to support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that over the past months the North Korean government has not been behaving properly and I hope they respond to pressure from the UN.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked what the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position was on the crisis, he underlined the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference for a UN-brokered resolution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously in all our interests to make sure that nothing escalates. We are very strongly in support of the UN process, which has and continues to put pressure on North Korea to stop acting in an irresponsible way and we will continue strongly to support the UN process which will I hope help to deescalate tensions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports to the EU jumped by 2% in the last three months, but exports to non-EU countries actually fell by 1.4%, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says it shows that certain promises made during the EU referendum are unfulfilled. Cable explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As with the extra \u00c2\u00a3350m a week for the NHS, the export boom dreamed up by the Brexiteers is nowhere to be seen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fall in the pound since the referendum has not given a significant boost to UK exporters, but has instead driven up the cost of imports for both businesses and consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As any half-decent economist will tell you, countries trade most with their closest neighbours. That is why Europe remains by far the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important export market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This underlines the need to protect UK exporters and control our trade deficit by remaining in the single market and customs union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The selloff in the financial markets is accelerating, as nervousness over the North Korean situation continues to grip trading floors. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has now slid by 80 points, or 1%, and other indices are all in the red too. European investors are following the lead from Asia overnight, where most markets fell and the South Korean won hit a one-month low. The potential of armed conflict between North Korea and the US is a serious concern for investors. The news that Pyongyang is officially working on a plan to attack Guam has added to concerns, deterring them from holding riskier assets. Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to hold gold (at a two-month high today), the Japanese yen, and US government bonds. Joshua Mahony of IG says For now, tensions are high, yet in all likeliness we will see this intensity simmer down somewhat, with both sides standing to lose more than they would gain from military action. Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is also disappointed by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data: A fall in exports and rise in imports caused the monthly trade deficit to nearly double. And, a deficit of \u00c2\u00a38.9bn in the second quarter of 2017 suggests that net trade made no contribution to growth in the quarter. Evidence of rebalancing, at least in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data, remains absent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No sign of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy rebalancing here.... Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap will get worse before it gets better. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The export-driven pickup in manufacturing, hoped for by some, has yet to materialise in the UK, despite survey data from the sector remaining reasonably optimistic. Instead, Manufacturing Production remained flat on the month while the goods trade balance fell further into negatives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following a large currency shock, the sort we saw in the aftermath of the referendum, adjustments in trade balance typically follow a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153J-Curve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, at first getting worse before they improve. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way from economic theory to reality and the length of this adjustment process is highly variable and difficult to predict, but June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data suggest we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not quite at the bottom yet, to say the least.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what a J-Curve looks like, via the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies: More details here, for readers who enjoy an economics lecture. In theory, a weak currency ought to help a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters and improve its trade figures. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data show that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really happening in Britain, as it continues to consume more goods and services than it sells to the rest of the world. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because modern trade is complex, with many companies buying raw materials or parts from abroad before selling their finished goods overseas. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade position in June was disappointing, and means the trade deficit in the second quarter of this year came in slightly higher than in the previous quarter. Taken together with the recent jump in the current account deficit, signals the continued weakness of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external position. The widening in the UK trade deficit in June was largely driven by a sharp rise in imports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses continue to report that the slump in the value of sterling since the EU referendum remains something of a double-edged sword, as many exporters are also importers, and so face higher input costs due to the weakening currency. While stronger global economic growth may help to boost the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export performance over the second half of the year, it is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent an overall weakening in growth. This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade reports, underlines how there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been no real improvement in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap since the Brexit vote: Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, warns there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scant signs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data that net trade could give Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy a growth burst. Ben Wright of the Daily Telegraph agrees that the goods trade figures are bad: The ONS has also reported that UK manufacturing output was flat in June, meeting City forecasts. However, the wider measure of industrial production jumped by 0.5% in the month - beating expectations. Economist Rupert Seggins reminds us that Britain hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved a trade surplus in almost 20 years..... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worsening trade gap was driven a 4.9% slump in the volume of goods exported in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst performance since June 2016, the month of the Brexit referendum. Newsflash! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit WIDENED by \u00c2\u00a32bn in June, dashing hopes that the gap between imports and exports might have narrowed. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total trade deficit in goods and services hit \u00c2\u00a34.6bn in June, up from a (downwardly revised) \u00c2\u00a32.5bn in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the widest deficit in nine months. The Office for National Statistics blames a surge of imports during June. It says: This was mainly due to an increase in imports of both goods and services of \u00c2\u00a31.7 billion. Of this, imports of goods contributed \u00c2\u00a30.6 billion, with imports in machinery and transport equipment (specifically mechanical machinery, aircraft and road vehicles) from EU countries up by \u00c2\u00a30.5 billion. The goods deficit swelled to \u00c2\u00a312.7bn, the ONS adds, a worse reading than expected. More to follow The pound has fallen back through the $1.30 mark this morning, to a three-week low of $1.2952. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the dollar is strengthening, as investors look for safe havens. The news that North Korea was formulating an attack on Guam sent shares down across Asia. Sam Chi Yung of South China Financial Holdings said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The North Korea situation is still unstable and investors are controlling risk and taking profit after recent gains.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistants, Sebastian Gorka, spoke about the situation on Radio 4 today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump has been unequivocal: he will use any appropriate measures to protect the United States and her citizens. We do not telegraph our future scenarios and how we are going to react,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you show players around a table your poker hand, you will lose that game. It is not a good idea in cards, it is a very bad idea in geopolitics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets have also added to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in early trading. The French, German and UK markets are all in the red in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 tumbled by 40 points to a one-week low. Mining shares are leading the fallers, reflecting concerns that the North Korea crisis could hurt the economy and dent demand for commodities. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE suffered another sharp fall at the open, as the latest developments in the US/North Korea situation weighed on its commodity stocks..... It appears that Pyongyang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detailed strike plan against Guam has created a sour backdrop to trading. (The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is also partly because some major companies have gone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, meaning new shareholders won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the next divi payment). The growing tensions between North Korea and the United States are continuing to weigh on the financial markets today. The gold price has hit a two-month high this morning, at $1,280.5 per ounce, as investors remain jittery following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threat earlier this week. Overnight, North Korea raised the stakes further by outlining a plan to fire a missile into the water near Guam, the US territory in the Pacific. General Kim Rak Gyom, the head of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic forces, declared that Trump was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bereft of reason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in a statement that could rile the US president. My colleague Julian Borger reports: The response from Pyongyang was its most public and detailed threat to date, and evidently meant to goad the US president. Trump had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153let out a load of nonsense about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 failing to grasp the ongoing grave situation. This is extremely getting on the nerves of the infuriated Hwasong artillerymen of the KPA.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is causing understandable concern over the border in South Korea. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi stock market index has fallen by 0.4% today, adding to the 1% wiped off shares on Wednesday. The South Korean Won is also suffering, falling by 0.8% to a four-week low against the US dollar. Although the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking, it is certainly watching the situation closely. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says investors are either sitting on the side-lines or looking to sell risky assets and buy safer ones. The escalation of the rhetoric between the US and North Korea is keeping market participants on their toes and with no fresh economic reports the price action is dictated by the headlines. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover whether the weak pound is helping Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, and making a dent in her trade deficit. The City is bracing for new UK trade figures at 9.30am; economists predict that the total gap between everything the UK imports and exports narrowed slightly in June, after jumping to \u00c2\u00a33.1bn in May. HSBC say: Trade volume growth appears to be moving in the right direction, with exports up 3.8% 3m/3m in May 2017, and imports growing more slowly at 2.8%. And the surveys back up anecdotal evidence that UK exports are responding to sterling weakness. However, so far, this has done little to reduce the trade deficit in absolute terms. We expect another relatively hefty deficit in June. New industrial production figures are also being released, and may show that manufacturing output was flat in June, month-on-month. A strong reading might raise hopes that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the second quarter of 2017 could be revised up, from the first estimate of 0.3%. On the corporate front, mining giant Glencore, the Co-operative Bank, estate agent Savills and sofa chain DFS are all reporting results.

                "bodyText":"US inflation rose to 1.7% in July from 1.6% in June. Economists had forecast a bigger rise, to 1.8%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. AM Tata Steel has agreed a new pension scheme for tens of thousands of workers, ending doubts about future payments. The trade unions Community, Unite and GMB said in a statement: We welcome the announcement which includes a commitment that Tata will stand behind a new scheme with reduced annual increases. For over a year our members have feared for their security in retirement, and this announcement helps to bring that uncertainty to an end. Wilko, the high street homewares and household goods chains, has warned almost 4,000 workers they could lose their jobs. The retailer, which reported an 80% drop in full-year profits last month, said it has placed 3,900 staff working as stock supervisors, till supervisors and assistant managers, into consultation, which could lead to redundancy. The company also said organisational changes could lead to the creation of about 1,000 new senior supervisor roles. Read our full story here: History tells us that we are probably not seeing the start of a sustained fall in US equities according to economists at Capital Economics: The recent escalation of tensions between the US and North Korea has weighed on the S&amp;P 500. But provided that war is avoided, we doubt that this marks the start of a sustained downturn in the index. This was the case for US equities during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world arguably came closest to conflict between two nuclear-armed powers. Although the S&amp;P 500 fell after US President Kennedy announced the discovery of missiles on Cuba, it had recovered its losses before Soviet General Secretary Khrushchev announced six days later that the missiles would be removed. There have been other instances since WW2 when the US has potentially been on the brink of a war that did not break out. Admittedly, these did not pose such a direct threat to the US. But they also typically had little lasting effect on the S&amp;P 500. Our assumption is that there will not be a war between the US and North Korea. We are therefore sticking to our forecast for the S&amp;P 500 to end this year and next only a touch below its current level. President Trump has taken to Twitter with a fresh warning for North Korea: The lack of conciliatory tone is unlikely to sooth markets. The FTSE 100 is now down 90 points as investors find little to cheer about.

Helena Smith reports: From the outset, the progressive leftist Syriza party and the arch-nationalist, ultra right wing Independent Greeks, Anel, made for odd bedfellows. Austerity, or rather the two parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dislike for it, was their common point of reference. With the worst of bailout negotiations finally over and unpopular pension cuts and tax hikes legislated, rumours of a rift have been growing. Today, Panos Kammenos, leader of Independent Greeks, took to the airwaves to try and dispel the speculation: We are participating in the government but have made clear our red lines with regards to issues of religion, the homeland and national matters \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we often disagree in parliament. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that each person cannot express their personal opinion. But veteran leftists in Syriza are grumbling, arguing that with Anel as its partner the coalition will never be able to move ahead with the leftist policies it wants to implement now that the worst of fiscal adjustment is over. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, boosted by exports, household spending and investment. GDP increased by 1% between April and June, compared with the same period a year earlier, up from 0.7% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast a slight slowdown to 0.6%. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office raised its forecast for full-year growth in 2017 to a range of 3-4% from 2-3% previously. However, Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics, said growth in Hong Kong is likely to slow: We think GDP growth will slow in the second half of the year. The recent strength in capital spending won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last. The city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overheated property market also remains a major concern. For this year as a whole, we remain comfortable with our forecast that GDP will grow by around 3.3%, which is well above most expectations. But we expect growth to slow to 1.5% in 2018, which is lower than most expect. July inflation rates for the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economies have been confirmed: Germany: 1.7% France: 0.8% Italy: 1.2% Spain: 1.5% The VIX index, which measures market expectations of short-term volatility, has hit 17.19. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory in November.

                "body":"<p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market has hit the buffers as political uncertainty, stamp duty changes and squeezed household incomes all dampen buyer demand.</p> <p>Over the past week, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest mortgage lender, Halifax, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/07/uk-house-prices-slow-four-year-low-halifax\" title=\"\">annual house price growth had slowed</a> to the weakest rate in four years and the official surveyors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 body said that activity was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/10/uk-property-market-slowdown-political-uncertainty-surveyors\" title=\"\">back to 2011 levels</a> in some parts of the UK.</p> <p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors in both London and south-east England were reporting falling prices, though the national picture is balanced by price rises in the West Midlands, the south-west and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Homeowners who have enjoyed rising prices for years should get used to slower rates of growth or even a drop in the value of their home, say property market experts. But a generation of renters who have felt cut off from the property ladder by increasingly unaffordable prices will be relieved to see the market cool off.</p> <p>We take a look at the housing market around the country and ask where things go from here.</p> <h2><strong>Prices</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Homeowners have so far escaped the house price crash that some forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, had warned could happen in the event of a Brexit vote. But the housing market has slowed markedly since the referendum.</p> <p>In the run-up to last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, house prices had been rising by around 8% each year. More recently, year-on-year growth has fallen below 5%, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/may2017\" title=\"\">as measured by the Office for National Statistics</a>. Other measures put house price growth significantly below that.</p> <p>For anyone trying to get a grip on the UK property market, there are a baffling number of house price trackers to wade through. The Halifax measure, closely followed by economists, said prices in the three months to July were 2.1% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. That was lower than in June (2.6%) and the slowest annual rate since April 2013. Revealing those figures last week, Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax Community Bank, said sluggish wage growth and rising inflation were weighing on house prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-11T15:31:55/embed.html\" data-alt=\"House prices\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-11T15:31:55/embed.html\">House prices</a> </figure>  <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.</p> <p>Data on rental prices is more patchy. Rental prices rose by 1.1% in July compared with the same month a year ago, the first increase seen for three months, according to HomeLet, an insurance company that compiles a monthly lettings market tracker. It put the average monthly rent at \u00c2\u00a3925. Estate agent Your Move reported rents were up 2.1% on the year in June, with the average rent for England and Wales at \u00c2\u00a3827.</p> <h2><strong>The London market</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the prime London property market was seen as one of the big beneficiaries of the vote to leave. The assumption was that the fall in the value of the pound would make a des res in Mayfair, Belgravia or Chelsea more affordable for foreign buyers.</p> <p>It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked out like that. The London market, according to Rics, is heading south faster than any other region of the UK. Prices are falling, sales are weak and instructions from new sellers are drying up.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for the tough market conditions in the capital. Half the buy-to-let transactions in the UK are accounted for by London, and these have fallen sharply since the introduction of new stamp duty rules in April 2016. The previous jump in prices in the years leading up to the EU referendum had meant home ownership was simply too expensive for those working in the capital, so some form of market correction was inevitable. The uncertainty caused by Brexit has provided the catalyst.</p> <p>HomeLet said rent rises in London continued to lag the UK as a whole, falling by 0.6% in July compared with a year earlier. The average monthly rent in the capital was now \u00c2\u00a31,564, it added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0b0c61af81bd7a62915974bef1026ac5f8fd88b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0b0c61af81bd7a62915974bef1026ac5f8fd88b/0_161_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House for sale signs in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The London property market has not boomed as the pound has weakened</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Activity</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Economists have highlighted declining sales as evidence that the housing market has cooled. They fell 3% between May and June to 96,910, the lowest level since October 2016, according to HMRC data.</p> <p>Rics said <a href=\"http://www.rics.org/Global/7._WEB_%20July_2017_RICS_UK_Residential_Market_Survey_tp.pdf\" title=\"\">in its latest update</a> that buyer demand had failed to show any meaningful growth since last November and that the flow of fresh listings was deteriorating, so that average stock levels on estate agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 books were close to record lows.</p> <p>Fionnuala Earley, chief economist at Countrywide, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest estate agency group, says fewer people believe it is a good time to move house.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the moment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a needs-based market rather than desire-based and the factors behind that are squeezed household incomes and expectations about future house prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see people improving rather than moving. They are saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCan I get a loft conversion done rather than pay the stamp duty?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2><strong>Mortgage rates</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Traditionally, the UK housing market softens when interest rates are raised in an attempt to prevent overheating. But not this time. As the Bank of England <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2017/aug.aspx\" title=\"\">pointed out in its latest inflation report</a>, mortgage rates are about as low as they have ever been.</p> <p>Someone who wants to borrow 90% of the value of the property they are buying can do so at 2.5% fixed for two years, down from 4.1% between 2013 and 2015, and 6% in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis between 2009 and 2012. A two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value mortgage is available at 1.5%, compared with 3.7% in the post-crisis period.</p> <p>These low rates may not last forever, however. Hints from the Bank of England that it is thinking of raising borrowing costs for the first time in a decade are already having an impact. Interest rates charged in the financial markets have edged up as a result and this will eventually filter through into higher mortgage rates.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street has made it clear that when official interest rates are finally raised, the increases will be slow and measured. The Bank is worried that too sharp a rise could lead to financial distress for those who have borrowed large sums to get on the housing ladder.</p> <h2><strong>Supply</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A key factor propping up house prices is the longstanding mismatch between supply and demand. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568403/Housing_Supply_England_2015-16.pdf\" title=\"\">Nearly 190,000 homes</a> were built in 2015-16, an eight-year high, but that was still far short of the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/economic-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/housing-report-publication/\" title=\"\">300,000 a year</a> needed to meet demand, according to the Lords economic affairs committee when it looked into the housing crisis last year.</p> <p>The Conservative party pledged in its latest election manifesto to meet a 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and 500,000 more by the end of 2022.</p> <p>But Earley at Countrywide said that would not be enough to make up the past shortfall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got that spectre over the market and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supportive of house prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <p>The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 local authorities in England and Wales, is calling for councils to have more powers and funding, in order to resume their historical role as significant builders of affordable homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-11T16:41:38/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Housing stocks\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-11T16:41:38/embed.html\">Housing stocks</a> </figure>  <p>The homelessness charity Shelter also wants to see a shake-up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our current model of housebuilding simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delivering the affordable homes we desperately need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it allows big developers to make millions while ordinary families face colossal housing costs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anne Baxendale, Shelter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of communications, policy and campaigns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to introduce a fresh new way of building homes which brings down the huge cost of land and delivers genuinely affordable and high-quality homes that millions of families are crying out for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The government says it is working on the problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re investing \u00c2\u00a37.1bn to build more affordable homes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already helped more than 400,000 households into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, and the number of first-time buyers is at a nine-year annual high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2><strong>The outlook</strong></h2> <p>Both Halifax and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/01/house-prices-stabilise-as-number-of-homes-on-the-market-falls\" title=\"\">Nationwide</a> say a lack of homes on the market will continue to support house prices in coming months. Rics is predicting flat prices and rents for at least the next year.</p> <p>The Rics survey of agents, covering 538 branches, found that for the next 12 months, a net balance of 28% anticipate an increase in prices. But that was the least positive reading since last July, immediately after the EU referendum.</p> <p>Countrywide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Earley sees downside risks for house prices from a Brexit-related rise in unemployment and from the Bank of England raising interest rates. On the other hand, there is an upside risk following a period of subdued activity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer that we have got low transactions, the more pent-up demand we have. When confidence returns, things could pick up more quickly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Earley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect big falls in house prices but on the other side I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect there to be big increases in incomes to push house prices up significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Martin Beck at consultancy Oxford Economics said there was a lack of drivers to push up house price growth but equally an absence of the kind of forces which have typically caused prices to&#xa0;fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK house price growth is running out of steam. And with household incomes squeezed and the affordability of housing stretched, we think a prolonged period of very modest growth lies ahead.

Over the past week, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest mortgage lender, Halifax, said that annual house price growth had slowed to the weakest rate in four years and the official surveyors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 body said that activity was back to 2011 levels in some parts of the UK. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors in both London and south-east England were reporting falling prices, though the national picture is balanced by price rises in the West Midlands, the south-west and Northern Ireland. Homeowners who have enjoyed rising prices for years should get used to slower rates of growth or even a drop in the value of their home, say property market experts. But a generation of renters who have felt cut off from the property ladder by increasingly unaffordable prices will be relieved to see the market cool off. We take a look at the housing market around the country and ask where things go from here. Prices Homeowners have so far escaped the house price crash that some forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, had warned could happen in the event of a Brexit vote. But the housing market has slowed markedly since the referendum. In the run-up to last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, house prices had been rising by around 8% each year. More recently, year-on-year growth has fallen below 5%, as measured by the Office for National Statistics. Other measures put house price growth significantly below that. For anyone trying to get a grip on the UK property market, there are a baffling number of house price trackers to wade through. The Halifax measure, closely followed by economists, said prices in the three months to July were 2.1% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. That was lower than in June (2.6%) and the slowest annual rate since April 2013. Revealing those figures last week, Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax Community Bank, said sluggish wage growth and rising inflation were weighing on house prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Data on rental prices is more patchy. Rental prices rose by 1.1% in July compared with the same month a year ago, the first increase seen for three months, according to HomeLet, an insurance company that compiles a monthly lettings market tracker. It put the average monthly rent at \u00c2\u00a3925. Estate agent Your Move reported rents were up 2.1% on the year in June, with the average rent for England and Wales at \u00c2\u00a3827. The London market In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the prime London property market was seen as one of the big beneficiaries of the vote to leave. The assumption was that the fall in the value of the pound would make a des res in Mayfair, Belgravia or Chelsea more affordable for foreign buyers. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked out like that. The London market, according to Rics, is heading south faster than any other region of the UK. Prices are falling, sales are weak and instructions from new sellers are drying up. There are a number of reasons for the tough market conditions in the capital. Half the buy-to-let transactions in the UK are accounted for by London, and these have fallen sharply since the introduction of new stamp duty rules in April 2016. The previous jump in prices in the years leading up to the EU referendum had meant home ownership was simply too expensive for those working in the capital, so some form of market correction was inevitable. The uncertainty caused by Brexit has provided the catalyst. HomeLet said rent rises in London continued to lag the UK as a whole, falling by 0.6% in July compared with a year earlier. The average monthly rent in the capital was now \u00c2\u00a31,564, it added. Activity Economists have highlighted declining sales as evidence that the housing market has cooled. They fell 3% between May and June to 96,910, the lowest level since October 2016, according to HMRC data. Rics said in its latest update that buyer demand had failed to show any meaningful growth since last November and that the flow of fresh listings was deteriorating, so that average stock levels on estate agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 books were close to record lows. Fionnuala Earley, chief economist at Countrywide, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest estate agency group, says fewer people believe it is a good time to move house. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the moment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a needs-based market rather than desire-based and the factors behind that are squeezed household incomes and expectations about future house prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see people improving rather than moving. They are saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCan I get a loft conversion done rather than pay the stamp duty?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mortgage rates Traditionally, the UK housing market softens when interest rates are raised in an attempt to prevent overheating. But not this time. As the Bank of England pointed out in its latest inflation report, mortgage rates are about as low as they have ever been. Someone who wants to borrow 90% of the value of the property they are buying can do so at 2.5% fixed for two years, down from 4.1% between 2013 and 2015, and 6% in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis between 2009 and 2012. A two-year fixed-rate 75% loan-to-value mortgage is available at 1.5%, compared with 3.7% in the post-crisis period. These low rates may not last forever, however. Hints from the Bank of England that it is thinking of raising borrowing costs for the first time in a decade are already having an impact. Interest rates charged in the financial markets have edged up as a result and this will eventually filter through into higher mortgage rates. Threadneedle Street has made it clear that when official interest rates are finally raised, the increases will be slow and measured. The Bank is worried that too sharp a rise could lead to financial distress for those who have borrowed large sums to get on the housing ladder. Supply A key factor propping up house prices is the longstanding mismatch between supply and demand. Nearly 190,000 homes were built in 2015-16, an eight-year high, but that was still far short of the 300,000 a year needed to meet demand, according to the Lords economic affairs committee when it looked into the housing crisis last year. The Conservative party pledged in its latest election manifesto to meet a 2015 commitment to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and 500,000 more by the end of 2022. But Earley at Countrywide said that would not be enough to make up the past shortfall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got that spectre over the market and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supportive of house prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 local authorities in England and Wales, is calling for councils to have more powers and funding, in order to resume their historical role as significant builders of affordable homes. The homelessness charity Shelter also wants to see a shake-up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our current model of housebuilding simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delivering the affordable homes we desperately need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it allows big developers to make millions while ordinary families face colossal housing costs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anne Baxendale, Shelter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of communications, policy and campaigns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to introduce a fresh new way of building homes which brings down the huge cost of land and delivers genuinely affordable and high-quality homes that millions of families are crying out for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government says it is working on the problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re investing \u00c2\u00a37.1bn to build more affordable homes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already helped more than 400,000 households into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, and the number of first-time buyers is at a nine-year annual high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The outlook Both Halifax and Nationwide say a lack of homes on the market will continue to support house prices in coming months. Rics is predicting flat prices and rents for at least the next year. The Rics survey of agents, covering 538 branches, found that for the next 12 months, a net balance of 28% anticipate an increase in prices. But that was the least positive reading since last July, immediately after the EU referendum. Countrywide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Earley sees downside risks for house prices from a Brexit-related rise in unemployment and from the Bank of England raising interest rates. On the other hand, there is an upside risk following a period of subdued activity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer that we have got low transactions, the more pent-up demand we have. When confidence returns, things could pick up more quickly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Earley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect big falls in house prices but on the other side I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect there to be big increases in incomes to push house prices up significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin Beck at consultancy Oxford Economics said there was a lack of drivers to push up house price growth but equally an absence of the kind of forces which have typically caused prices to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK house price growth is running out of steam. And with household incomes squeezed and the affordability of housing stretched, we think a prolonged period of very modest growth lies ahead. But the prospect of a crash is remote,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.",

They should have known it all along, of course, since Facebook has never disguised its ambition to crush any social media upstarts that get in its way. But it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent Snap being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/snapchat-ipo-valuation-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy-snap-inc\" title=\"\">valued at a colossal $28bn on its first day of trading</a> on the US stock market in March.</p> <p>Five months later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/snapchat-shares-fall-losses-wall-street\" title=\"\">the valuation has halved</a>, prompting chief executive Evan Spiegel to pledge that he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell any of their shares this year. This promise was meant to signal the duo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep belief in the long-term success of Snap. In fact, the gesture was no more than the minimum required to sustain flagging spirits. If the founders had left their options open with the shares trading below their IPO price, there would have been panic. As it was, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/snapchat-shares-fall-losses-wall-street\" title=\"\">the shares fell 16% after second-quarter results on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Debate around those figures was dominated by Spiegel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that Wall Street analysts are looking at his camera app company through the wrong lens. Forget about the number of daily users, he argued with irritation, and look at the amount of time users spend on Snapchat, and how much advertisers are willing to pay.</p> <p>Spiegel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general point is fair: advertising revenue is what ultimately counts. The trouble is, Snap doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet have a good story to tell on that front. Average revenue per user was $1.05 in the quarter, up from $0.90 in the previous three months. A quarter-on-quarter increase of 16% is not be sniffed at, but the revenue numbers only become explosive when combined with lots of new users. Snap added only 7.3 million, a quarter-on-quarter rise of only 4%, to reach 173 million. No wonder Spiegel would prefer people to look somewhere else.</p> <p>The awkward fact remains that Snap is actually a small company in its industry. Revenues were $182m in the quarter and $331m over six months. That suggests that reaching $1bn for 2017, as some on Wall Street had expected, will be a stretch.</p> <p>Even if it achieved that, is it really sensible to value Snap at 14 times its revenues? The figure seems absurd when you remember that this is a six-year-old business that still makes heavy losses and has to face the formidable companies of Facebook \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially Instagram, which seems to be directly aimed at Snapchat these days.</p> <p>One can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame Spiegel, of course, if investors were prepared to put such a high price on hope at the IPO. Investors were so mad for a slice of the action that they all allowed him to get away with the governance outrage of issuing shares with no voting rights whatsoever. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their lookout. But Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overhyped IPO, and subsequent share price fall, naturally prompts the question of whether there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wider bubble in the US technology market.</p> <p>The short answer is probably no. Or, rather, if there is, it is a different kind of bubble from the one that popped in 2001. Back then, almost every stock with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tag went up like a rocket. Investors have learned to discriminate. Stocks such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Tesla remain hellishly difficult to value by old yardsticks, but the market is commendably ruthless in punishing the shares of overpromoted companies that disappoint financially, like Twitter.</p> <p>The same process now seems to be under way at Snap. The IPO itself was a triumph of the investment bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 art of generating a buzz and a fear of missing out. But now the party is over. Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthy. To command even Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrunken valuation, you have to do more than invent an animation of a dancing hot dog, the current viral sensation. You have to show you can make money from it.</p> <h2>Family ties and animal fat should never catch out the Bank</h2> <p>The mistakes that forced Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England in March are well-documented.

But now the party is over. Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthy. To command even Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrunken valuation, you have to do more than invent an animation of a dancing hot dog, the current viral sensation. You have to show you can make money from it. Family ties and animal fat should never catch out the Bank The mistakes that forced Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England in March are well-documented. One of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-connected individuals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her parents both had leading roles in John Major\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government and her grandfather was Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had forgotten to disclose that her brother (also Quintin) worked at Barclays. She compounded her error by telling MPs on the Treasury select committee that the Bank knew about her brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role, before having to admit that she had not disclosed this and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code of conduct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which she had helped write. Now, though, it is clear that the Bank could have handled the case better. A review commissioned by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-executive directors into the embarrassing chain of events found that the usual processes were not followed when she first joined the Bank in 2013. There was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153informal exchange of emails\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the then chair of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oversight body \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the court of directors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and nothing more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role being registered at the outset,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the reported pointed out. Well, quite. The Bank has now pledged to sort out its processes and make the matter of conflicts of interests clearer during interviews. It should set itself a goal to ensure that no one else ever has to leave under such circumstances. It might also think about how it got itself into such a mess over banknotes. Its new plastic notes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indestructible even when dipped in curry by governor Mark Carney \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are not so durable in the face of public scrutiny. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re made with tallow, an animal fat, and so are unacceptable to millions of UK residents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c according to a petition. The Bank is, however, sticking with tallow: using palm oil was found to cause its own problems. These are two situations that, perhaps, the Bank could have handled better from the start. Wilko pins its woes on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational living wage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chancellor Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final austerity budget surprised the industry by its unilateral imposition of a statutory minimum living wage at well above expected levels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reports Wilko, the family-owned homewares and households goods retailer, in its annual report for last year. That overly dramatic description was perhaps a warm-up for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that almost 4,000 jobs at the company are at risk. This was presented as an exercise in internal restructuring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a stripping out of a layer of management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a grumble about the former chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2015 budget all helps to encourage the idea that outside forces are upsetting the retail sector. Yet times can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too hard at Wilko, despite the expansion of rival discount chain B&amp;M in the homewares market. The Wilkinson family still managed to pay themselves a \u00c2\u00a33m dividend for the year. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imposed on them. Rather, it was a conscious choice.",

The safe haven status of the yen appears to be driving today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves, rather than the data itself, with the currency down against its peers as traders unwind some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positions.</p> <p>Gold is also coming off its highs, having come close to $1,300 on Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c peaking just above $1,190 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before once again running into resistance and dropping more than half a percentage point today. Should tensions between the two countries ramp up once again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that $1,300 level will hold for long though, which would see it return to the levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the US election when markets temporarily went into strong risk aversion mode.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59917eb9e4b07d1140960ed6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-14T10:43:12.428Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Portugal:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anaa_luis/status/897042075400667136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Portugal growth figures for Q2 of +0.2%  qoq and +2.8% yoy are out, very much in line with our forecast. +2.4% expected for the full year</p>&mdash; Ana Lu\u00c3\u00ads Andrade (@anaa_luis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anaa_luis/status/897042075400667136\">August 14, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599179ade4b0cf3b87d682c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-14T10:24:24.136Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European markets continue to recover, Wall Street is forecast to open in positive territory, with the futures suggesting a near 100 initial rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The Dow futures are pointing to an 100 point rise once the bell rings on Wall Street; that would still leave the US index the wrong side of 22000, but with only 30 or so points needed to close the gap.

Most indicators point to accelerating growth in production, but data for June suggests that any acceleration from the trend of recent years has yet to happen.</p> <p>We see the Eurozone boom of 2017 everywhere except in the industrial production numbers. While the growth in new orders for manufacturing has been well above 6% YoY for several months now, industrial production has dropped back to 2.6% YoY growth, which is not much better than what has been seen since 2014. It is somewhat disappointing that production has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. With the start of the crisis now ten years ago, industrial production is still 6.5% below its peak. After this lost decade for Eurozone industry, a stronger recovery could be expected. Production data is notoriously volatile and subject to revisions, so a break in trend often only emerges after a few months of data.</p> <p>Due to strength in orders and businesses noting strong improvements in production, it seems that an improved trend for production is still in the cards. This would indicate that the surprising growth in the Eurozone could continue in the second half of the year. But while a weaker June reading actually makes an acceleration in the third quarter easier, the manufacturing PMI fell to a six-month low in July. This false start to the quarter was also seen in other surveys, which could mean that 3Q GDP will be a touch weaker than the first half of the year, but that would still lead to a healthy 2% annual GDP growth rate for 2017. No need to become pessimistic about the Eurozone just yet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59917111e4b07d1140960e90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-14T09:47:46.294Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The fall in European stocks is not just due to the worries about the growing tension between the US and North Korea, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst the selling seen in stocks in the past week was widely attributed to the US-N.Korea story there has in fact been a fairly prolonged period of declines for European indices.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round up of what has been a fairly calm day after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Korea- inspired uncertainties. There was some mixed economic news across the globe. In Japan, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP grew at 4% on an annualised basis in the second quarter, compared to expectations of 2.5% growth. But eurozone industrial production disappointed, falling by 0.6% in June compared to the 0.5% decline analysts had been expecting. And in Portugal, GDP growth fell from 1% in the first quarter to 0.2% in the second, albeit it grew by 2.8% on an annualised basis. But stock markets recovered some ground, on the basis that no news is good news as far as any repeat of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intemperate rhetoric from North Korea and the US was concerned. The FTSE 100 is up 0.47%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 1.16% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.85%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open just over 100 points higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for - among other things - the UK inflation figures. The Bundesbank has been widely believed to be one of those pushing for the ECB to get on with easing its QE programme. But a speech by German central bank director Andreas Dombret in South Africa suggests it remains supportive of ECB policy. Reuters reports: The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy-money policy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much justified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because a recovery in euro zone inflation remains muted, Andreas Dombret, a director at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bundesbank, said on Monday. Dombret\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest the Bundesbank - which has long criticised the ECB ultra-easy policy of massive bond purchases and sub-zero interest rates - would be unlikely to push for an abrupt tightening when rate setters meet again in the autumn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The signs of a sustained turnaround in terms of inflation are muted, so far,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dombret said in a speech in Pretoria, South Africa. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is therefore a broad consensus on the whole that an expansionary monetary policy is very much justified.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dombret said views differed among ECB rate setters on the degree of support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where perspectives do differ, though, is on how strongly the ECB should step on the monetary policy pedal and what instruments it should use,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. ECB policymakers are due to discuss the future of their 2.3 trillion euros ($2.71 trillion) bond-buying programme, with a decision expected in October. Market expectations are for an extension of the programme, albeit at a lower pace than the current 60 billion euros per month. As we mentioned before, there has been some pressure on the European Central Bank to ease off on its quantitative easing and low interest rate programme. But the weaker EU industrial production figures and the dip in Portuguese second quarter growth add to the idea this may not happen in the immediate future: Things may be calmer in the markets at the moment but that could change suddenly if the rhetoric from North Korea or the US flares up again. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Risk appetite is slowly returning to the markets on Monday, with no further escalation between the US and North Korea incentivising a gradual move back towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153riskier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this signifies a belief that relations between the two countries will suddenly improve, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a case of no news being good news and that will likely continue for as long as it lasts. The problem is that both sides can be rather unpredictable so things could escalate at any point and trigger another dash for safety. Gold, the yen and the Swiss franc may be coming off their highs at the moment but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not convinced it will last. It seems this collective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and possibly temporary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sigh of relief that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing is once again overshadowing the economic news that we had overnight, with Japanese GDP figures smashing expectations while numbers from China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were less encouraging. The safe haven status of the yen appears to be driving today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves, rather than the data itself, with the currency down against its peers as traders unwind some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positions. Gold is also coming off its highs, having come close to $1,300 on Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c peaking just above $1,190 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before once again running into resistance and dropping more than half a percentage point today. Should tensions between the two countries ramp up once again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that $1,300 level will hold for long though, which would see it return to the levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the US election when markets temporarily went into strong risk aversion mode. Back with Portugal: As European markets continue to recover, Wall Street is forecast to open in positive territory, with the futures suggesting a near 100 initial rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With little to disrupt it the market-wide rebound continued this Monday, investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the moment at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c putting their nuclear fears to one side. Though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still lagging its Eurozone peers, the FTSE managed to widen its gains to more than half a percent this morning, pushing the index back towards 7350. Luckily its commodity stocks are yet to pay too much attention to the losses seen by Brent Crude and copper; the black stuff slipped under $52 per barrel, while the metal dropped 0.7%, following a trio of data-misses from China overnight. The DAX and CAC remained at the front of the pack as lunchtime approached, rising 1.1% and 1% respectively. Both were aided by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight dip; though the currency is up 0.1% against the pound, sending sterling below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.10 in the process, it fell 0.2% against the dollar after the Eurozone-wide industrial production reading came in at a worse than forecast -0.6%. Looking to this afternoon and the Dow Jones is all set to join in with the early in the week recovery. The Dow futures are pointing to an 100 point rise once the bell rings on Wall Street; that would still leave the US index the wrong side of 22000, but with only 30 or so points needed to close the gap. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a lot going on beyond that, especially since investors appear to be ignoring the events in Charlottesville, meaning the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains may go unchallenged. News from Portugal, where GDP grew by 2.8% year on year in the second quarter, the same level as the previous three months. The quarter on quarter increase however was 0.2%, down from 1% in the first quarter, according to the statistics office. Domestic demand remained strong but exports of goods and services continued to be weak. Despite the weaker than expected eurozone industrial production figures, there is no need to worry too much, says ING Bank economist Bert Colijn: The recovery of Eurozone industry remains somewhat cautious as strong growth in May has been followed by a 0.6% drop in June. Most indicators point to accelerating growth in production, but data for June suggests that any acceleration from the trend of recent years has yet to happen. We see the Eurozone boom of 2017 everywhere except in the industrial production numbers. While the growth in new orders for manufacturing has been well above 6% YoY for several months now, industrial production has dropped back to 2.6% YoY growth, which is not much better than what has been seen since 2014. It is somewhat disappointing that production has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. With the start of the crisis now ten years ago, industrial production is still 6.5% below its peak. After this lost decade for Eurozone industry, a stronger recovery could be expected. Production data is notoriously volatile and subject to revisions, so a break in trend often only emerges after a few months of data. Due to strength in orders and businesses noting strong improvements in production, it seems that an improved trend for production is still in the cards. This would indicate that the surprising growth in the Eurozone could continue in the second half of the year. But while a weaker June reading actually makes an acceleration in the third quarter easier, the manufacturing PMI fell to a six-month low in July. This false start to the quarter was also seen in other surveys, which could mean that 3Q GDP will be a touch weaker than the first half of the year, but that would still lead to a healthy 2% annual GDP growth rate for 2017. No need to become pessimistic about the Eurozone just yet. The fall in European stocks is not just due to the worries about the growing tension between the US and North Korea, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB: Whilst the selling seen in stocks in the past week was widely attributed to the US-N.Korea story there has in fact been a fairly prolonged period of declines for European indices. The Eurostoxx for instance made a 2017 peak back in May and has since fallen by more than 7% to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low. The market now trades back at a similar level to where it was prior to the 1st round of the French election, after which Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progression sparked a strong move to the upside as the seeming avoidance of a populist party gaining power sparked a sharp rally in stocks. Whilst it is tempting to feel that the current weakness will now cease as the prospect of a nuclear war seemingly recedes, there were other factors weighing on the Eurostoxx - such as the local currency appreciation - that will likely persist. Markets continue to recover some ground on hopes that the tensions between the US and North Korea have eased. The FTSE 100 is now up 0.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up more than 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.9%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European equity markets appear to have left the fears of late last week behind, with investors coming out of their defensive positions to move back into riskier assets. Chinese involvement in the recent spat between North Korea and the US has been one of the biggest calming influences, highlighting that for the US to go to war with North Korea it must first go through China. However, with China moving to implement a ban on whole host of North Korean products (such as coal, lead, and fish), it is clear that it is aware that something needs to be done to reign in the rebellious neighbours. Today has precious few major economic releases out of Europe and the US, with traders instead focusing on the shift out of havens, while preparing for a busy week ahead. Those havens, which were in demand last week among the uncertainty, are out of favour now, with gold down around $8 an ounce at $1281: Meanwhile the weaker than expected Chinese data earlier has seen oil slip back, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $51.8 a barrel, and also kept the lid on metal prices. Some underwhelming data from Europe. Industrial production in the eurozone fell by 0.6% in June, slightly worse than the 0.5% decline analysts had been expecting. But it rose 2.6% on an annualised basis. In the wider EU it fell by 0.5% but rose 2.8% year on year. This compares with a 1.2% rise in May for both areas. The statistics office Eurostat said the decline was due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153production of capital goods falling by 1.9%, durable consumer goods by 1.2%, non-durable consumer goods by 0.4% and intermediate goods by 0.3%, while production of energy rose by 1.8% \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The positive Japanese data is good news for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, says Yann Quelenn at Swissquote Bank: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth came in much higher than forecasted at 1% q/q versus 0.6% for the second quarter. Looking back, this release is the best data in the last two and a half years. It also represents the sixth consecutive quarter of positive GDP growth. Consumer spending has largely improved and helped spur on the good data. Indeed, spending rose 0.9% from Q1 and beat the estimate of 0.5% for the quarter. Consumer spending has traditionally been the weakest point of the Japanese economy. This is maybe changing, but a string of data will be needed to confirm this trend. Recent fundamentals are good news for the Bank of Japan, which is still the only major central bank not able to hint about further tightening. For the time being, good numbers must at some point translate into inflation. Nationwide inflation stands at 0.4% y/y \u00e2\u20ac\u201c way below the inflation target of 2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this despite the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Abenomics policies and massive quantitative easing. The BoJ monetary policy still cannot be considered as a success. The only true gains have been in stock market, where the Nikkei 225 increased by 16% over the last 12 months. Currency-wise, the yen is weakening against the dollar and remains under pressure for further appreciation. Geopolitical tensions and market uncertainties may trigger a risk-off move towards yen again. This is the curse of being a safe haven. However that does mean..... Back with the better than expected Japanese growth figures: In another sign of the calmer mood at the start of the new week, the VIX volatility index has fallen back after last week hitting its highest level since President Trump was elected. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: All is relatively calm, all is relatively quiet on the geopolitical front and long may that last. Markets are, as a result, trying to get back to biz-as-usual. Yields are slightly higher in bond-land, equity indices finding their feet, bitcoin making new highs seemingly ad infinitum. President Trump has problems everywhere - from the tensions with North Korea to the death of a woman at a weekend anti-racism rally - and his economic plans could also be in trouble. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the view of S&amp;P Global ratings, which says Trump could struggle to meet economic growth targets. In a new report it says: After the failure of the Republican plan to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repeal and replace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Affordable Care Act, S&amp;P Global Ratings believes the prospects for the administration to work with lawmakers to enact its promised pro-growth plans are, in a word, dim, said an article published today, titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Departed: Can U.S. Lawmakers Spur GDP Growth When They Return?.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We no longer believe the federal government will be able to push through even a small infrastructure-spending package--much less the $1 trillion the White House has suggested,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said U.S. Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino. We still expect a small tax cut of $500 billion, rather than true tax reform, to be passed early next year as midterm elections approach. S&amp;P global has argued that permanence is key to making tax reform effective, which would require bipartisan support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With U.S. economic growth stuck at around 2% and as the baby boomers retire, the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to cut immigration would likely put the U.S. on the path to even slower rates of economic growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ms. Bovino. Hard-tariff policies could provoke a messy scenario in which the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade partners could retaliate in some way. But a limited restriction, which we think seems more likely at this point, may be more symbolic than a meaningful hit to aggregate flows. We expect the current expansionary period--now in its ninth year and the third-longest since World War II--to continue into 2018--with little help from Uncle Sam--albeit at a modest pace. As expected, shares are moving ahead in early trading as some of the volatility of the past week eases. The FTSE 100 is up 0.25%, with Standard Life up 2% as it completes its merger with Aberdeen. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.4%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.57% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened 0.7% better. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities said: There is strong fundamental backing behind the major equity markets - with the low interest rates policies being the key catalyst - so stock traders will probably find the opportunity to re-establish their long bets at lower prices after the recent pullback. The eurozone industrial production figures could show the effects of the recent strength of the euro. The single currency has benefitted from weakness elsewhere, particularly in the dollar, but this is causing a problem for the European Central Bank. President Mario Draghi is under pressure to begin easing the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing and low interest rate policy, but a stronger euro makes that more tricky. Commenting on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected data, Dave Madden at CMC Markets said: The consensus is for a reading of -0.4% and 2.9% on a month-on-month basis and on a year-on-year basis respectively. The relative strength of the euro is hitting the region, and traders want to see if that is still the case. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market turmoil in the wake of growing tensions and belligerent rhetoric between North Korea and the US, the week looks like starting on a calmer note. As Kathleen Brooks at City Index put it: The fact that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see an escalation in the rhetoric from either side over the weekend could be enough to trigger a recovery after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risk selloff, and keep the markets focused on the economic fundamentals. President Trump of course now has some rather pressing domestic concerns to deal with after a woman was killed at an anti-racism rally over the weekend. As for the economic fundamentals, there has already been some positive news from Japan in the form of forecast-beating growth figures. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second quarter GDP grew by 1% quarter on quarter or 4% in annualised terms, which was higher than the 2.5% expected. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: That makes Japan the fastest growing economy in the G7 this quarter by our reckoning and may re-start the chatter about the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eventual QQE [Qualitative Monetary Easing] exit strategy.... This was not one of those flukey one-offs that was caused by a surge in inventories that will be worked down in coming quarters, or one of those random spikes caused by exports and imports growing out of synch. Although it is usually exactly the wrong thing to respond to volatile Japanese GDP data by revising full year forecasts, arithmetically, it is going to be hard for us to see only the 1.2% for 2017 we currently have pencilled in, and an upgrade now seems extremely likely. Elsewhere Chinese retail sales and industrial production rose by 10.4% and 6.4% respectively in July, but this was slightly below analyst forecasts. Even so the Nikkei 225 is up around 0.98% and the Hang Seng is 1.16% better, as investors focussed on the Japanese data. European markets are also forecast to open higher: It is a thin day for economic data otherwise. The agenda: 10 BST Eurozone Industrial Production figures",

Sterling is now down 0.9% at $1.2848. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A rebound in retail sales in the US in July has triggered further gains in the US dollar on Tuesday, sending the greenback to its highest level in almost three weeks.</p> <p>Retail sales have been very underwhelming this year which has contributed to the view that the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for another rate hike this year. The dollar was already relatively well bid heading into the release on the back of some hawkish comments from William Dudley on Monday and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release is doing that no harm. Not only did the July numbers comfortably beat expectations but the June numbers were also revised higher, providing an additional boost for dollar bulls.</p> <p>While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report will likely increase the chances of another rate hike this year, it is still far from being priced in by the markets. The general trend of retail sales still remains worrying, despite the improvement over the last couple of months and 2% inflation still looks a pipe dream. That said, the dollar has been so heavily sold over the course of the year that even a slight unwinding of these trades could provide a near-term boost to the greenback. The dollar index has recently been languishing at levels seen only half a dozen times or so since the start of 2015 but not yet breached. With that in mind, it may take relatively little at the moment to get such a reaction in the dollar. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ee43e4b0ae030608a809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T12:53:57.044Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The strong US retail sales could portend a good third quarter economic performance, and a December rate rise from the Federal Reserve. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US retail sales figures for July are very good, rising 0.6% month on month in July versus the consensus 0.3% forecast. There were also big upward revisions from -0.2% month on month to +0.3% month on month for June.</p> <p>There were broad based gains with 10 of the 13 broad retail categories reporting rising sales. This suggests the household sector is strong and in our view bodes well for a 3% GDP figure for third quarter 2017 growth. With consumer confidence at firm levels, employment continuing to rise and wages showing some evidence of picking up we remain optimistic on the prospects for consumer spending.</p> <p>The details of the report show that gasoline sales were a drag (-0.4%) due to lower prices and with this category excluded sales were up 0.7%. There were strong performances from motor vehicles and building materials (both up 1.2%) with internet, department stores and miscellaneous stores also performing strongly. The only areas of disappointment were electronics (-0.5%) and clothing (-0.3%).</p> <p>Markets continue to focus on current low inflation rates, but with the labour market tightening and the growth story looking ok the prevailing view within the Fed is likely to remain that low inflation is merely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We think inflation will be back at the 2% target by the end of the year and also predict a December Fed rate hike. We continue to expect two more 25bp hikes next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ecf5e4b0b54351f65509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T12:45:48.360Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CityIndex/status/897436143624605698\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The dollar index is benefitting from the positive surprise in the US economic data, key resistance coming up fro DXY at 93.54 - recent high.</p>&mdash; City Index (@CityIndex) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityIndex/status/897436143624605698\">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ebede4b0b54351f65503\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T12:42:50.237Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the sam time as the US retail sales, there has been more positive data, with the New York Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Empire State business conditions jumping from 9.8 in July to 25.2 in August.

Both headline and core CPI remained unchanged in year on year terms as the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall failed to offset a 1.3% decline in petrol prices. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to pinpoint the weakness to any one-off quirks, but sizeable declines in the prices of clothing, footwear and household goods may potentially suggest that retailers have again had to cut prices to get shoppers buying their summer wares.</p> <p>Whatever the reason though, we still think headline inflation looks set to inch closer to 3% towards the end of this year as the full extent of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near-20% fall since November 2015 filters through. But the big question for policymakers is where inflation would be if this currency effect is stripped out. One way of looking at this, by excluding goods with a high import-intensity, suggests that inflation would be slightly below 2% if the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuations are removed.</p> <p>But what matters for the Bank of England is wage growth. We expect this to hold steady at 2% tomorrow, and in fact, for much of the rest of this year. The combination of slowing economic momentum, political uncertainty and rising import costs mean that firms are likely to have limited incentive to accelerate pay rises.</p> <p>While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will continue to test the patience of some BoE hawks, we expect the committee as a whole to continue \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclooking through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inflation spikes in favour of slower growth. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a rate hike this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad9a7878e5940476473223663b5ad1284b0cc1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ad9a7878e5940476473223663b5ad1284b0cc1a/0_99_2267_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clothing sales showed smaller falls compared to a year ago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clothing sales showed smaller falls compared to a year ago</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst:</strong></h2> <p>The Brexit vote inflation wave may have already crested. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number is lower than we saw a couple of months ago, it does not mean that inflation in itself is low. The defining driver of the run of higher prices has been the devaluation of the pound following the vote to leave the EU, those declines will start to fall out of the calculations in the coming months.</p> <p>The Bank of England is not under pressure to raise rates from prices at the moment, and will not be by the end of the year. Of course this could all change if sterling continues its recent decline against the euro.</p> <p>The lower than expected number is good news, but its importance can only be truly recognised once the context of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage numbers and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data is taken into account.</p> <h2>Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital:</h2> <p>The expected pickup didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Inflation remains cooler and the pound dipped as investors had expected a rebound in July following the surprise drop in June...The data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t radically alter the view on the Bank of England, but it certainly cements the belief that a rate hike this year now looks highly unlikely. The market was positioned for a bit more inflation than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting.</p> <p>CPI is still expected to peak at 3% later this year before easing back, yet there are signs that inflation may have already peaked. The sterling exchange rate has stabilised, meaning far less pass-through from the weaker pound on the inflation rate. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re even getting to the stage in the year where the pound will be actually stronger than it was 12 months before, especially against the US dollar. Of course the pass-through from the exchange rate is a little more complex than that, but the broad picture is that the pound is pretty near to where it was last year.</p> <p>If inflation has peaked, it would be good news for British workers, with wages still falling in real terms (confirmation of this trend is expected in tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data). It would also be good news for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer-driven economy, which may ultimately be pound positive if it means resilient growth and the Bank thinks it can hike gently without upsetting wider economic confidence.</p> <h2><strong>Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown:</strong></h2> <p>It now looks quite possible inflation has peaked, and will fall back further incoming months. The year-on-year increase in producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raw material costs fell to 6.5% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c undershooting forecasts for a 7.0% rise. This was down from 10% in June, the biggest month-to-month slowdown in almost five years. Input prices are a leading indicator for consumer price inflation as higher input prices are often ultimately passed on to the consumer, and therefore a lower number here could bode well for softer consumer prices down the line.</p> <p>All this is good news for the consumer, as it helps alleviate the continuing squeeze on household finances, though pay is still shrinking in real terms for now. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market update is expected to show wage growth remained at 1.8% for the three months to July.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also good news for borrowers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c moderating inflation means less pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates, and will allow the MPC to remove the sticking plaster of ultra-low interest rates very slowly indeed. With only two of the eight members voting for higher rates earlier this month, it seems even a return to 0.5% is some way off for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a424b317209c93ab65057fdede7b95b7319cf39f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a424b317209c93ab65057fdede7b95b7319cf39f/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protests this month outside the Bank of England over low pay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protests this month outside the Bank of England over low pay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International:</strong></h2> <p>The income squeeze on cash-strapped UK consumers continues with July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading showing the CPI (Consumer Price Index) remaining at 2.6%. The main drivers behind this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food price inflation are a rise in the cost of bread and cereals, meat and fruit. However, this month the main focus will be on the RPI (Retail Prices Index) reading, as the July figure is used to determine by how much rail fares will increase in the new year. Commuters will face an eye-watering 3.6% increase in the cost of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanytime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and season tickets in England and Wales in 2018, adding to mounting expenses.<br></p> <p>UK households continue to feel the squeeze as price rises continue to outpace earnings. Rising inflation coupled with dwindling wage growth means real wages are falling. In its August inflation report, the Bank of England pointed out that uncertainty over the economic outlook may be affecting companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to raise pay, projecting that regular pay growth will remain subdued over the rest of 2017. </p> <p>The Bank expects inflation to fall back towards the 2% target during 2018 as past increases in fuel prices drop out of the annual comparison, but this will mean very little if our earnings fail to keep up with price rises. </p> <p>Over the longer term, expect rising inflation to be a fleeting occurrence due to a number of economic trends. First, an aging population limits the size of the global workforce, which by corollary suppresses economic activity. Meanwhile rising inequality and the growing cohort of self-employed people with limited earning power, such as Uber drivers in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, means less money is being spent.</p> <p>Less economic activity, and less money spent, means prices are unlikely to be driven upwards, keeping a lid on inflation over the long term.</p> <p>If inflation stays low and economic growth remains tepid, there is no reason for the Bank of England to risk the economic recovery by putting up interest rates any time soon.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t budge much at all despite signs we may be in for a smoother Brexit.

If it flies with Michel Barnier and co it could be a lot more pound positive than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing now. There are also doubts about whether this would be palatable for the Brexit camp in parliament and among voters if it involves compromises on the divorce bill and the free movement of people.

A rise to 2.7% is expected which is not going to shift the dial on what the market expects from the Bank of England.

GDP growth in the second quarter came in at 0.6% QoQ, from a slightly upwardly revised 0.7% QoQ in the first quarter of 2017. On the year, the German economy grew by 2.1%.</p> <p>The detailed growth components will only be released towards the end of the month but based on monthly data the economy continues firing on all cylinders. Growth was driven by public and private consumption, investment and the construction sector.</p> <p>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success story goes on and on and on. And there is very little reason to fear a sudden end to the current performance, even though some kind of slowdown from current growth rates looks almost inevitable. The drivers supporting the domestic economy, like record high employment, higher wages and government consumption, might lose some momentum along the way, without turning negative. The same holds for the export sector, where a stronger euro, weaker-than-expected US growth and Brexit uncertainty could take some wind out of the sails without bringing exports to a halt.</p> <p>While the current growth drivers could lose some momentum, investments could emerge as the new engine going into the second half of the year and beyond. Since the small setback at the turn of the year, production expectations have increased continuously. Order books are filled again and inventories have been reduced. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry has also increased continuously since mid-2016 and is now clearly above its historical average. A combination which under normal circumstances should be a safe bet for stronger investments.</p> <p>With today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth data, it will be hard for any opposition party to pick out the economy as a main theme for the final stage of the election campaign. Even Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior coalition partner, the social-democratic SPD, finds it hard to get the credits from the electorate for the current strong growth performance. When it comes to the economy, it seems as if Angela Merkel sits in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winner-takes-it-all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position.

                "bodyText":"After a quiet day for economic news on Monday, investors have had more to get their teeth into today. The UK inflation data defied forecasts, with the consumer price index remaining steady at 2.6% in July, compared to expectations of an increase to 2.7%. Falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food. But the retail price index came in at 3.6%, higher than the forecast 3.5%. That means a hefty price rise is on the cards for rail travellers. The lower than expected CPI figure led most analysts to suggest a UK interest rate rise was not imminent, which helped send the pound lower. Elsewhere Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, but this was slightly below expectations. And US retail sales were stronger than expected in July, rising 0.6% compared to forecasts of an increase of around 0.4%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The strengthening dollar following the US retail sales numbers has accelerated the decline in the pound. Sterling is now down 0.9% at $1.2848. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: A rebound in retail sales in the US in July has triggered further gains in the US dollar on Tuesday, sending the greenback to its highest level in almost three weeks. Retail sales have been very underwhelming this year which has contributed to the view that the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for another rate hike this year. The dollar was already relatively well bid heading into the release on the back of some hawkish comments from William Dudley on Monday and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release is doing that no harm. Not only did the July numbers comfortably beat expectations but the June numbers were also revised higher, providing an additional boost for dollar bulls. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report will likely increase the chances of another rate hike this year, it is still far from being priced in by the markets. The general trend of retail sales still remains worrying, despite the improvement over the last couple of months and 2% inflation still looks a pipe dream. That said, the dollar has been so heavily sold over the course of the year that even a slight unwinding of these trades could provide a near-term boost to the greenback. The dollar index has recently been languishing at levels seen only half a dozen times or so since the start of 2015 but not yet breached. With that in mind, it may take relatively little at the moment to get such a reaction in the dollar. The strong US retail sales could portend a good third quarter economic performance, and a December rate rise from the Federal Reserve. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: US retail sales figures for July are very good, rising 0.6% month on month in July versus the consensus 0.3% forecast. There were also big upward revisions from -0.2% month on month to +0.3% month on month for June. There were broad based gains with 10 of the 13 broad retail categories reporting rising sales. This suggests the household sector is strong and in our view bodes well for a 3% GDP figure for third quarter 2017 growth. With consumer confidence at firm levels, employment continuing to rise and wages showing some evidence of picking up we remain optimistic on the prospects for consumer spending. The details of the report show that gasoline sales were a drag (-0.4%) due to lower prices and with this category excluded sales were up 0.7%. There were strong performances from motor vehicles and building materials (both up 1.2%) with internet, department stores and miscellaneous stores also performing strongly. The only areas of disappointment were electronics (-0.5%) and clothing (-0.3%). Markets continue to focus on current low inflation rates, but with the labour market tightening and the growth story looking ok the prevailing view within the Fed is likely to remain that low inflation is merely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We think inflation will be back at the 2% target by the end of the year and also predict a December Fed rate hike. We continue to expect two more 25bp hikes next year. At the sam time as the US retail sales, there has been more positive data, with the New York Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Empire State business conditions jumping from 9.8 in July to 25.2 in August. This is better than the expected level of 10, and was the highest since September 2014. The July retail sales rise was the biggest in seven months, and the figures received a boost from sales of motor vehicles. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: President Donald Trump will be breathing a sigh of relief today after the latest data showed retail sales in the US bounced back from a disappointing couple of months to move into positive territory. This indicates the US consumer is now choosing to spend rather than save, which bodes well for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term growth and will put Fed chair Janet Yellen in a bullish mood. US retail sales rose by a higher than expected 0.6% in July, while the previous month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised upwards. Analysts had been expecting an increase of around 0.4% following two months of decline. But June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.2% fall was revised to a 0.3% increase. Over in the US, retail sales are due shortly and are expected to show a slight rebound after two months of decline. In June they fell 0.2% but analysts are forecasting a rise last month to between 0.3% and as much as 0.6%. The pound is now down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.2872, while against the euro it is down more than 0.4% \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0951. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling turned sour this Tuesday after July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK CPI reading fell short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts. While, at 2.6%, inflation is still troublesome \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially since wage growth is lurking around the 1.8% mark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it nevertheless wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as high as the expected 2.7%. More importantly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent way away from the 2.9% reading seen in May. And given that the Bank of England didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull the rate hike trigger at that level, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to do it for anything lower, helping to explain why the pound found itself in such a bad mood once the figure was released. Cable more than doubled its losses and now finds itself back below $1.29 after plunging 0.7%, while against the euro sterling switched from a 0.3% rise to a 0.4% fall, dragging it to yet another fresh 10 month nadir. This allowed the FTSE to overcome its early reticence, the UK index climbing 25 points to sit just underneath the 7400 it abandoned during last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Korea-fearing trading. UK inflation may have come in lower than expected in July but it is higher than other major economies: More on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on inflation and the rail fare increases: Rail commuters facing a steep 3.6% increase in ticket prices might find it tough to accept but there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK inflation. Rising prices have been one of the big economic stories of the past 12 months, but for the past two months the financial markets have been surprised by the weakness of cost-of-living pressures. The reason for that is simple: the two factors that have been driving inflation higher since the summer of 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c higher global oil prices and the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the EU referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have almost washed through the system. A quick look at the Office for National Statistics data for producer prices helps explain what has been going on. Producer prices are a measure of inflation early in the supply chain, since they gauge both the cost to firms of buying in fuel and raw material, and the prices of goods as they leave factory gates. Fuel and raw material prices rose fast in the second half of 2016, with the annual rate of increase peaking at 19.9% in January. Since then, though, it has fallen month after month, dropping from 10% in June to 6.5% in July. Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full analysis is here: The overall inflation figures may be understating the real cost of living for many people, says Simon McCulloch, director of comparethemarket.com: The fact that inflation has stayed at 2.6% tells only part of the story and certain segments of society are feeling the effects more than others. Our research shows that household bills are increasing at twice the rate of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, indicating that families - a group that may be more exposed to higher energy, insurance, petrol and broadband costs as well as mortgage payments - are affected in a more acute way than the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline 2.6% figure suggests. Whereas certain elements of the inflationary basket of goods may be remaining flat, households which are already feeling the squeeze are experiencing a period of rapid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153billflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the average household paying out \u00c2\u00a3845 a month. Even so, the pound is not acting as if a rate rise is on the cards any time soon. It is now down 0.52% at $1.2893 against the dollar - its lowest level for a month - and 0.35% lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0967. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: The pound has been largely out of favour ever since the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last policy meeting a couple of weeks ago, where only two Monetary Policy Committee members voted for a rate rise. Given the recent rise in inflation and the general improvement in the UK economy, the markets were surprised by the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovishness. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release of the latest inflation data for the month of July underscores the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach... the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate reaction was a swift drop. The fall in the pound has given a lift to the FTSE 100, especially its large number of overseas earners. The leading index is now up 0.4% to a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high of 7384. Well, it seems not everyone thinks a UK interest rate rise before long can be ruled out. Nick Dixon, Pension Director at Aegon, said: After last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise dip, inflation remains above target, although it has not continued its upward march in the way many expected. While concerns about stagnant wages, anaemic economic growth, and a reliance on cheap debt remain, sustained above-target inflation is continuing to build the case for an interest rates rise in the not-too-distant future. Such an increase would present new challenges, and new opportunities, for those owning investments whose valuations are linked with interest rates. All asset classes feel richly valued at present so we take a cautious view in aggregate, with particular concerns around fixed interest, real estate, non-sterling assets and US equities where valuations look particularly high. The Federation of Small Businesses has called for government help for companies to deal with inflationary pressures. National chairman Mike Cherry, said: Operating costs for small firms are now at their highest in four years. Increasing inflationary pressure has coincided with a bruising business rates revaluation and rising employment costs. Our entrepreneurs are paying themselves less and further increasing prices in an attempt to handle the strain. Four in ten small firms raised prices in response to April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Living Wage increase. A hike in rail fares in line with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RPI will put further pressure on the consumer pocket, leaving all concerned with less to spend and invest. The Government should consider whether this inflationary measure is fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. The Chancellor needs to give very careful consideration to the upcoming Budget. With small firms feeling the squeeze, any increase in insurance premium tax, fuel duty or other stealth taxes will be bad for investment and job creation. We need to see all tax reliefs maintained, not least entrepreneurs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relief, which represents an important incentive for our business owners. One general conclusion from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures seems to be that they confirm the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: July was another disappointing month for UK inflation. Both headline and core CPI remained unchanged in year on year terms as the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall failed to offset a 1.3% decline in petrol prices. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to pinpoint the weakness to any one-off quirks, but sizeable declines in the prices of clothing, footwear and household goods may potentially suggest that retailers have again had to cut prices to get shoppers buying their summer wares. Whatever the reason though, we still think headline inflation looks set to inch closer to 3% towards the end of this year as the full extent of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near-20% fall since November 2015 filters through. But the big question for policymakers is where inflation would be if this currency effect is stripped out. One way of looking at this, by excluding goods with a high import-intensity, suggests that inflation would be slightly below 2% if the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuations are removed. But what matters for the Bank of England is wage growth. We expect this to hold steady at 2% tomorrow, and in fact, for much of the rest of this year. The combination of slowing economic momentum, political uncertainty and rising import costs mean that firms are likely to have limited incentive to accelerate pay rises. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will continue to test the patience of some BoE hawks, we expect the committee as a whole to continue \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclooking through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inflation spikes in favour of slower growth. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a rate hike this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: The Brexit vote inflation wave may have already crested. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number is lower than we saw a couple of months ago, it does not mean that inflation in itself is low. The defining driver of the run of higher prices has been the devaluation of the pound following the vote to leave the EU, those declines will start to fall out of the calculations in the coming months. The Bank of England is not under pressure to raise rates from prices at the moment, and will not be by the end of the year. Of course this could all change if sterling continues its recent decline against the euro. The lower than expected number is good news, but its importance can only be truly recognised once the context of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage numbers and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data is taken into account. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: The expected pickup didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Inflation remains cooler and the pound dipped as investors had expected a rebound in July following the surprise drop in June...The data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t radically alter the view on the Bank of England, but it certainly cements the belief that a rate hike this year now looks highly unlikely. The market was positioned for a bit more inflation than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting. CPI is still expected to peak at 3% later this year before easing back, yet there are signs that inflation may have already peaked. The sterling exchange rate has stabilised, meaning far less pass-through from the weaker pound on the inflation rate. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re even getting to the stage in the year where the pound will be actually stronger than it was 12 months before, especially against the US dollar. Of course the pass-through from the exchange rate is a little more complex than that, but the broad picture is that the pound is pretty near to where it was last year. If inflation has peaked, it would be good news for British workers, with wages still falling in real terms (confirmation of this trend is expected in tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data). It would also be good news for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer-driven economy, which may ultimately be pound positive if it means resilient growth and the Bank thinks it can hike gently without upsetting wider economic confidence. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: It now looks quite possible inflation has peaked, and will fall back further incoming months. The year-on-year increase in producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raw material costs fell to 6.5% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c undershooting forecasts for a 7.0% rise. This was down from 10% in June, the biggest month-to-month slowdown in almost five years. Input prices are a leading indicator for consumer price inflation as higher input prices are often ultimately passed on to the consumer, and therefore a lower number here could bode well for softer consumer prices down the line. All this is good news for the consumer, as it helps alleviate the continuing squeeze on household finances, though pay is still shrinking in real terms for now. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market update is expected to show wage growth remained at 1.8% for the three months to July. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also good news for borrowers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c moderating inflation means less pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates, and will allow the MPC to remove the sticking plaster of ultra-low interest rates very slowly indeed. With only two of the eight members voting for higher rates earlier this month, it seems even a return to 0.5% is some way off for now. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: The income squeeze on cash-strapped UK consumers continues with July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading showing the CPI (Consumer Price Index) remaining at 2.6%. The main drivers behind this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food price inflation are a rise in the cost of bread and cereals, meat and fruit. However, this month the main focus will be on the RPI (Retail Prices Index) reading, as the July figure is used to determine by how much rail fares will increase in the new year. Commuters will face an eye-watering 3.6% increase in the cost of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanytime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and season tickets in England and Wales in 2018, adding to mounting expenses. UK households continue to feel the squeeze as price rises continue to outpace earnings. Rising inflation coupled with dwindling wage growth means real wages are falling. In its August inflation report, the Bank of England pointed out that uncertainty over the economic outlook may be affecting companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to raise pay, projecting that regular pay growth will remain subdued over the rest of 2017. The Bank expects inflation to fall back towards the 2% target during 2018 as past increases in fuel prices drop out of the annual comparison, but this will mean very little if our earnings fail to keep up with price rises. Over the longer term, expect rising inflation to be a fleeting occurrence due to a number of economic trends. First, an aging population limits the size of the global workforce, which by corollary suppresses economic activity. Meanwhile rising inequality and the growing cohort of self-employed people with limited earning power, such as Uber drivers in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, means less money is being spent. Less economic activity, and less money spent, means prices are unlikely to be driven upwards, keeping a lid on inflation over the long term. If inflation stays low and economic growth remains tepid, there is no reason for the Bank of England to risk the economic recovery by putting up interest rates any time soon. Good news for borrowers, bad news for savers and retirees. Both measures of inflation have been rising steadily since a year ago: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on how the rise in the retail price index will lead to higher rail fares: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some commentary on inflation: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the UK Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the inflation figures: Although inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living. That is why we have given the lowest paid a pay rise through the National Living Wage and are cutting taxes for 31 million people. The pound has edged slightly lower against the dollar following the inflation data. It now stands at $1.2923, down 0.3%, as the prospects of any imminent rate rise fade further. Fuel prices fell by 1.3% between June and July 2017, the fifth successive month of price decreases, said the ONS. Over the same period last year they rose by 0.7%. There were smaller rises for a range of goods and services, but the ONS added: The 12-month inflation rates for some of the broad groupings (namely food and non-alcoholic beverages; clothing and footwear; miscellaneous goods and services; furniture and household goods) have edged up to the highest seen for several years. This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) had been rising fairly steadily since last summer until last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip: The Office for National Statistics said falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food. House prices rose 4.9% in June, said the ONS, compared to 5% in May. This is the weakest since March. The consumer price index had been expected to rise from 2.6% to 2.7%, rather than hold steady. But it still means that living standards are being squeezed. Wage growth has been lagging behind price rises and this is expected to continue in coming months. Economists expect average weekly earnings to have grown by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time. Stripping out bonuses, the figure is forecast to be 2%. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has unexpectedly held steady at 2.6% in July,. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the consumer price index, which is the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure when considering the level of interest rates. The retail price index has climbed to a higher than expected 3.6%. and this is bad news for train passengers: it is the level used by the government to set rail fare increases. Another reason for the strengthening of the dollar is Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment from one of the US Federal Reserve members about the prospects of further interest rate rises this year. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG explains: The US dollar has strengthened following relatively hawkish comments from Fed Vice Chair William Dudley, who stated that he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be in favour of doing another rate hike later this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the economy continues to hold up in line with his expectations. The recent softer-than-expected US inflation readings do not appear to have dampened his appetite to continue raising rates gradually as much as the market is currently anticipating. He also signalled that market expectations for a September announcement from the Fed on when it plans to begin shrinking their balance sheet were not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Overall the comments should offer some support for the US dollar in the near-term but the market is likely to remain sceptical over the likelihood of another rate hike later this year at the current juncture. Ahead of the UK inflation figures, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a list of what economists are expecting the figure to be at the year end: Markets are - just about - holding onto their early gains but Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, is urging caution: The ease with which equity markets have shrugged off last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes is reassuring, but also a little bit frightening. Reassuring in that it confirms there is a wave of liquidity willing and actively looking for buying opportunities on any dips. Frightening in that markets appear to be utterly invincible to any threat, despite potentially stretched valuations. It looked like the market was at a tipping point last week, but the robust rally over the past two days suggests that there are still plenty of investors who think otherwise. Trying to call the top of this market has been a fool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s errand over the past few months and the weight of money supporting the market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show any sign of abating. Meanwhile after the latest Brexit moves and ahead of the UK inflation figures, the pound is still managing to keep fairly steady, down just 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2939. The dip is partly due to the US currency strengthening as tensions over North Korea ease somewhat. The prospect of a deal between the UK and the EU to retain the key benefits of the customs union for a period following Brexit has also done little to lift the pound. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t budge much at all despite signs we may be in for a smoother Brexit. There was little to no uplift so far from the proposal for Britain to have a customs union with the EU for some years after the official Brexit date in 2019. The market is treating anything from London with due caution, rightly so given the open splits in the cabinet and precarious tenure of Theresa May. The real test comes when the third round of Brexit talks begin. If it flies with Michel Barnier and co it could be a lot more pound positive than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing now. There are also doubts about whether this would be palatable for the Brexit camp in parliament and among voters if it involves compromises on the divorce bill and the free movement of people. It also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address services, although it is a pretty good guide to what the government will pursue on that front. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a pound bull this looks like a big step, and a signal that the softer transition side in government is winning the argument, but the sanguine response from the markets only highlights how far we have to go in the negotiation process. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got the CPI inflation data out at 09:30 that is keeping money on the side lines for the time being. A rise to 2.7% is expected which is not going to shift the dial on what the market expects from the Bank of England. It will have to be a big beat (which looks unlikely given the retreat last month) to get people talking up a rate hike this year again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the easing of tensions over North Korea, markets are edging higher at the open. Ahead of the UK inflation figures, the FTSE 100 has added 0.11% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax opened 0.5% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex are both up 0.4%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World First economist Jeremy Cook on the UK inflation figures and the possible effect on the pound: The German economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, which is good news for Chancellor Merkel ahead of the forthcoming elections, even if the figure was slightly below forecasts. The quarter on quarter rate was lower than a revised 0.7% figure for the first quarter and the forecast of a similar level for the second three months. The annualised rate of growth was 2.1%, up from 2% in the first quarter. This was well below the 4% recorded by Japan on Monday, but above the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.7%. The Federal Statistics Office said domestic demand grew but foreign trade slipped back: The quarter-on-quarter comparison (upon adjustment for price, seasonal and calendar variations) shows that positive contributions came from domestic demand. Final consumption expenditure of both households and general government increased markedly... According to provisional calculations, the development of foreign trade, however, had a downward effect on growth because the price-adjusted quarter-on-quarter increase in imports was considerably larger than that of exports. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: The German economy continues its strong performance with another above-trend growth rate of 0.6% QoQ in 2Q 17. Even in its ninth year, the German economic recovery is still going strong. GDP growth in the second quarter came in at 0.6% QoQ, from a slightly upwardly revised 0.7% QoQ in the first quarter of 2017. On the year, the German economy grew by 2.1%. The detailed growth components will only be released towards the end of the month but based on monthly data the economy continues firing on all cylinders. Growth was driven by public and private consumption, investment and the construction sector. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success story goes on and on and on. And there is very little reason to fear a sudden end to the current performance, even though some kind of slowdown from current growth rates looks almost inevitable. The drivers supporting the domestic economy, like record high employment, higher wages and government consumption, might lose some momentum along the way, without turning negative. The same holds for the export sector, where a stronger euro, weaker-than-expected US growth and Brexit uncertainty could take some wind out of the sails without bringing exports to a halt. While the current growth drivers could lose some momentum, investments could emerge as the new engine going into the second half of the year and beyond. Since the small setback at the turn of the year, production expectations have increased continuously. Order books are filled again and inventories have been reduced. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry has also increased continuously since mid-2016 and is now clearly above its historical average. A combination which under normal circumstances should be a safe bet for stronger investments. With today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth data, it will be hard for any opposition party to pick out the economy as a main theme for the final stage of the election campaign. Even Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior coalition partner, the social-democratic SPD, finds it hard to get the credits from the electorate for the current strong growth performance. When it comes to the economy, it seems as if Angela Merkel sits in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winner-takes-it-all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position. The lack of new structural reforms or the lack of investments (both in traditional and digital infrastructure) has so far not affected voters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences. All in all, the German economy is still thriving and currently the biggest risk is probably policy complacency. Still, it looks increasingly unlikely that economic topics will decide the upcoming elections. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market turmoil caused by North Korea and the US being at loggerheads, an easing of the tensions between the two countries has seen a sense of calm return. Not only does North Korea appear to be toning down some of the belligerent rhetoric, but China has stepped in to comply with UN sanctions against the country. So after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, markets are expected to move higher again at the open: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A busier day for economic figures sees the release of UK inflation data and US retail sales figures for July. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already had German GDP figures, which have come in slightly below expectations (more shortly.....) On the UK inflation front, the consumer price index is expected to edge up from 2.6% year on year to 2.7% after a surprise fall in June. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: When the last set of inflation numbers were released in June they showed a sharp fall in headline CPI from 2.9% to 2.6%, a welcome decline at a time when consumers have been feeling an increasing squeeze on their incomes. This fall raised hopes that inflation may well have peaked and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July CPI numbers could well go further in reinforcing that belief, though most expectations are for a tick back higher to 2.7%, while core CPI is also expected to rise to 2.5% from 2.4%. A rise would be at odds with the recent softening in recent PPI numbers, which have slipped from 20% at the beginning of the year and could come in as low as 6.9% in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July numbers, but in line with the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts which suggest we could see 3% before year end. Despite the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent dovishness regarding interest rates, any increase could put that conviction to the test. But with the pound steady at $1.2963, the market clearly believes there is no hurry for the next rate rise. Meanwhile the retail price index - expected to come in at 3.5% - will be of particular interest to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s train passengers (which, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it, is most of us at one point or another.) For some reason the July RPI is used to calculate rail fare increases which come into effect in January, so prepare for further hikes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our preview of the inflation figures: Elsewhere we get US retail sales figures later which could show a pick-up in consumer spending after an underwhelming second quarter.

Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/uk/en/newsroom/news-releases/17-08-16-uk-productivity-sees-further-dip-in-q2-after-relapsing-markedly-in-q1-ey-item-club\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The further relapse in the second quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity fuels concerns over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall poor productivity record since the deep 2008/9 recession. This even allows for the possibility that there may well have been an appreciable cyclical element in the drop as GDP growth was slow in the first half of 2017 and business seemingly remained keen to employ amid potential shortages of labour. Given the uncertain economic and political outlook, it may be that several companies are trying to meet extra work by taking on labour rather than commit to investment. Persistent low earnings growth is facilitating labour growth. Productivity had seen growth through 2016, but it was hardly dynamic.</p> <p>The further second quarter dip in productivity is all the more disappointing as the UK has a lot of catching up to do on the productivity front as it has been markedly lagging its performance before the 2008/9 downturn.</p> </blockquote> <p>There may be structural factors at work, said Archer:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of the new jobs that have been created are in less-skilled, low-paid sectors where productivity is limited.</p> <p>The economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past prolonged weakness and financial sector problems may have hurt productivity through under-investment and an inefficient allocation of resources.

UK productivity per hour is now 35% below the German level, and 30% below the US, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming increasingly clear that decisive action is needed if we are to end this downward trend.</p> <p>Most people still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise that the largest drag on productivity is poor management and leadership skills, estimated to account for almost half of the productivity gap. Investing in apprenticeships to boost management talent, as well as technical skills, is therefore vital. Not only will doing so help solve our productivity problem, it will be crucial to building a globally competitive UK plc.</p> <h2>Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at the Work Foundation:</h2> <p>Overall, the evidence suggests that, despite the low headline rate of unemployment, there remains a lot of slack in the labour market.</p> <p>With employment continuing to rise while rates of immigration fall, this slack is likely to diminish over the coming months. But, with pay settlements now well below the rate of price inflation, there is no evidence to suggest that this is turning into sustained wage pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</h2> <p>There are signs that wage pressure could start to build. If you dig a bit deeper into the ONS data then you find that employment levels made another record high, the employment rate is at 75.1%. There has been a drop of 157,000 unemployed people in the UK in the last year, and the number of economically inactive people has also fallen by 90,000 in the past year. Although 883,000 people remain on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contracts, this has fallen by 20,000 in the past year. Although this is a fairly small decline, if more firms stop hiring people on zero hours contracts then we could see wage growth start to rise on a sustained basis.</p> <p>The market impact was a swift move higher in the pound, the FTSE 100 is also higher this morning along with other European indices, while the UK 10-year bond yield has also jumped back above 1.10%, which could sustain a deeper recovery in GBP. So far this data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any impact on UK consumer discretionary stocks like M&amp;S or Next, we may need to get confirmation of decent July retail sales figures before these stocks make a move.</p> <h2>James Smith, economist at ING Bank:</h2> <p>Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report was slightly healthier than might have been expected...The big question for the Bank of England is whether the ever-tighter jobs market starts to translate into a sharp acceleration in wage growth. We have seen slightly more momentum in the level of average weekly earnings recently following a particularly sluggish start to the year. That appears to corroborate the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that some of the recent weakness in pay growth is attributable to temporary factors like the apprenticeship levy and pension costs.</p> <p>However, even as the probability of a Brexit transition period increases, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of political uncertainty facing businesses. Throw in rising import costs, which will keep pressure on firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost bases, and slowing economic growth and consumer demand, then it looks unlikely that wage growth will pick up rapidly over coming months. Or at least, not enough to meet the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% target for 2018.</p> <p>In fact, we expect wage growth to hover around the 2% level for the rest of this year. With inflation likely to inch closer to 3%, that means real incomes will continue to be squeezed.</p> <p>We expect the Bank of England to increasingly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rising inflation and focus instead on the muted outlook for growth. A 2017 rate hike looks very unlikely.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59940c05e4b0f099f0196dd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-16T09:11:19.185Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is our report on the jobs and wages figures from economics editor Larry Elliott:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pay growth in the UK has started to pick up amid signs that the steady fall in unemployment may be boosting the bargaining power of workers.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that earnings growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same months of 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 2.0% in the three months to May.</p> <p>The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000.

When inflation is taken into account, however, real wages still fell by 0.5% in the three month period...</p> <p>There is some cause for optimism that the squeeze on household finances could come to an end later this year, though ultimately the light at the end of the tunnel could be provided by falling inflation rather than rising wages. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI numbers showed inflation remaining at 2.6% in July, and the hope is this will fall back towards the 2% target as the Brexit-induced weakness in the pound starts to fade.</p> <p>Yet despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news on wages, sustained growth could prove harder to come by.</p> <p>Conventional economic theory - the Phillips curve - suggests that with unemployment as low as it is, sooner or later demand for labour will outstrip supply and workers will be able to demand higher wages. However a fundamental shift in the labour market has led this relationship to break down, meaning wages remain depressed despite low unemployment. The cause seems to be a lack of underlying inflationary pressure, combined with technological developments and global competition which has weakened the bargaining power of the worker. Throw continuing lacklustre productivity growth into the mix too, and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction of 3% wage growth by next year could look optimistic.</p> <p>All this has implications for interest rates.

                "bodyText":"The UK cost of living squeeze has unexpectedly eased, albeit only marginally. According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, average weekly earnings grew by 2.1% year on year in the three months to June, much better than the 1.8% analysts had been forecasting. But, even with inflation holding steady at 2.6% rather than rising, that still means a 0.5% fall in real wages. As for the jobs figures, the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, marking the lowest level since early 1975. The pound recovered from early losses after the data, although not many analysts believe the figures make an imminent UK interest rate rise any more likely. Over in the eurozone, second quarter GDP rose by 2.2% on a year on year basis, slightly better than expected, and by 0.6% compared to the first three months of the year. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Some below par figures from the US housing market. Housing starts fell by 4.8% in July, compared to expectations of a 0.4% increase. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised down from an 8.3% rise to a 7.4% increase. More on the UK wages squeeze: UK productivity keeps falling, according to the second quarter jobs and wages data. Output per hour worked fell 0.1% quarter on quarter after a 0.5% decline in the first three months of the year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: The further relapse in the second quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity fuels concerns over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall poor productivity record since the deep 2008/9 recession. This even allows for the possibility that there may well have been an appreciable cyclical element in the drop as GDP growth was slow in the first half of 2017 and business seemingly remained keen to employ amid potential shortages of labour. Given the uncertain economic and political outlook, it may be that several companies are trying to meet extra work by taking on labour rather than commit to investment. Persistent low earnings growth is facilitating labour growth. Productivity had seen growth through 2016, but it was hardly dynamic. The further second quarter dip in productivity is all the more disappointing as the UK has a lot of catching up to do on the productivity front as it has been markedly lagging its performance before the 2008/9 downturn. There may be structural factors at work, said Archer: Many of the new jobs that have been created are in less-skilled, low-paid sectors where productivity is limited. The economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past prolonged weakness and financial sector problems may have hurt productivity through under-investment and an inefficient allocation of resources. There is particular concern that an extended inability to access capital held back innovation and investment by smaller companies. The jobs and wages data increase the chances of a UK rate rise before too long, reckons Kallum Pickering, senior UK Economist at Berenberg: For the UK monetary policy outlook, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upside surprise for labour demand and acceleration in wage growth matters far more than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downside surprise for headline inflation (2.6% in July versus an estimated 2.7%). Unemployment fell to 4.4% in June (4.5% expected) while weekly earnings excluding bonus accelerated to 2.1%, for the third month in a row, in line with our expectations but above the consensus (2.0%). Because monetary policy works with a lag, interest rate setters at the Bank of England (BoE) focus more on what the inflation picture will look like in a year or two. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current period of above-target (2% target) inflation is mostly driven by the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, which has pushed up import prices. But this effect will fade as the annual change in import prices washes out of the consumer price index. As the BoE is already looking through the sterling-effect, whether or not current inflation is a little higher or lower than expected is largely irrelevant for the policy outlook. However, in the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s model, an acceleration in wage growth today will cause underlying inflation to rise in the future. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upside surprise thus raises the chances of a policy tightening soon. Back with the UK data, and here is the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the unemployment numbers (no mention of wages so far, though): The eurozone economy appears to be firing on all cylinders, said economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Eurozone annual GDP growth has been revised upwards to 2.2% year-on-year in the second estimate. While growth could come down a touch in the second half of the year, we expect growth to come in at 2% for 2017.The quarterly growth rate was unrevised at 0.6% quarter on quarter, confirming the robust growth pace for the Eurozone in the first half of the year. No breakdown by components has been released as of yet, but some of the individual countries show the economy is firing on all cylinders right now. Domestic demand is improving significantly, while exports continue to grow despite uncertainty among trade partners and an appreciating euro. While some countries remain laggards in the eurozone, the good news at the moment is that poorer performers are also exceeding expectations. Italian growth in the second quarter lags the Eurozone average, but the 1.5% year on year growth did surprise analysts. Among the larger economies, the Dutch economy grew at an extraordinary pace of 1.5% quarter on quarter, a rate more commonly seen in booming developing economies. Spain also continues to record tremendous growth rates as the second quarter came in at 0.9% quarter on quarter, accelerating from 0.8% in the first quarter. The countries that experienced a deeper real estate crisis all seem to be recovering quite robustly at the moment as Irish growth is currently at 6.6% year on year, although figures for the second quarter have yet to be released. Given the incredible Dutch GDP growth and continued strength in Germany, the push for an end to QE in northern economies will become even louder as some key events are coming up. With inflation one of the few indicators that have not recovered to pre-crisis rates, the ECB will continue to be very cautious in its communication about the possible endings of QE. More signs of strength in the eurozone economy. On an annualised basis, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP grew by 2.2% in the second quarter, better than the original estimate of 2.1% and higher than analyst forecasts. The quarter on quarter growth figure was left unchanged at 0.6%, as expected. In the wider European Union the quarterly rise was also 0.6% while the annual figure was 2.3%. Here is a graph showing the EU and eurozone compared to the US: Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Strong economic performances from Germany, France and Spain have contributed to the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP being exactly where ECB president Mario Draghi would like it. Draghi has made it clear that he will refuse to budge on interest rates for the foreseeable future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a policy that appears to be working well. Given the political uncertainty in Europe over the past year, Draghi has sailed the ECB ship safely through the choppy waters of the Italian referendum and French election. The ECB will be hoping for calmer times ahead, but global financial instability is beyond its control. Should there be a slowdown in external trade due to a wobble in China, the UK or US, dark clouds could be on the horizon once again. And here is the pokesperson for Economic and Financial Affairs at the EU Commission: More reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data: Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute: It should be a real cause for concern that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity has fallen again, especially considering we still lag well behind our G7 peers in this area. UK productivity per hour is now 35% below the German level, and 30% below the US, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming increasingly clear that decisive action is needed if we are to end this downward trend. Most people still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise that the largest drag on productivity is poor management and leadership skills, estimated to account for almost half of the productivity gap. Investing in apprenticeships to boost management talent, as well as technical skills, is therefore vital. Not only will doing so help solve our productivity problem, it will be crucial to building a globally competitive UK plc. Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at the Work Foundation: Overall, the evidence suggests that, despite the low headline rate of unemployment, there remains a lot of slack in the labour market. With employment continuing to rise while rates of immigration fall, this slack is likely to diminish over the coming months. But, with pay settlements now well below the rate of price inflation, there is no evidence to suggest that this is turning into sustained wage pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: There are signs that wage pressure could start to build. If you dig a bit deeper into the ONS data then you find that employment levels made another record high, the employment rate is at 75.1%. There has been a drop of 157,000 unemployed people in the UK in the last year, and the number of economically inactive people has also fallen by 90,000 in the past year. Although 883,000 people remain on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contracts, this has fallen by 20,000 in the past year. Although this is a fairly small decline, if more firms stop hiring people on zero hours contracts then we could see wage growth start to rise on a sustained basis. The market impact was a swift move higher in the pound, the FTSE 100 is also higher this morning along with other European indices, while the UK 10-year bond yield has also jumped back above 1.10%, which could sustain a deeper recovery in GBP. So far this data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any impact on UK consumer discretionary stocks like M&amp;S or Next, we may need to get confirmation of decent July retail sales figures before these stocks make a move. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report was slightly healthier than might have been expected...The big question for the Bank of England is whether the ever-tighter jobs market starts to translate into a sharp acceleration in wage growth. We have seen slightly more momentum in the level of average weekly earnings recently following a particularly sluggish start to the year. That appears to corroborate the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that some of the recent weakness in pay growth is attributable to temporary factors like the apprenticeship levy and pension costs. However, even as the probability of a Brexit transition period increases, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of political uncertainty facing businesses. Throw in rising import costs, which will keep pressure on firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost bases, and slowing economic growth and consumer demand, then it looks unlikely that wage growth will pick up rapidly over coming months. Or at least, not enough to meet the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% target for 2018. In fact, we expect wage growth to hover around the 2% level for the rest of this year. With inflation likely to inch closer to 3%, that means real incomes will continue to be squeezed. We expect the Bank of England to increasingly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rising inflation and focus instead on the muted outlook for growth. A 2017 rate hike looks very unlikely. Here is our report on the jobs and wages figures from economics editor Larry Elliott: Pay growth in the UK has started to pick up amid signs that the steady fall in unemployment may be boosting the bargaining power of workers. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that earnings growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same months of 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 2.0% in the three months to May. The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000. The jobless rate fell to a fresh 42-year low of 4.4%. Employment was up by 125,000 at 32.1m in the three months to June. Despite the acceleration in earnings growth, living standards remained under pressure because pay has failed to keep pace with inflation, which stood at 2.6% in June. The full story is here: And here is the wages growth data: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Some positive news on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze from the ONS today, with average earnings growth beating expectations by growing 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to June. When inflation is taken into account, however, real wages still fell by 0.5% in the three month period... There is some cause for optimism that the squeeze on household finances could come to an end later this year, though ultimately the light at the end of the tunnel could be provided by falling inflation rather than rising wages. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI numbers showed inflation remaining at 2.6% in July, and the hope is this will fall back towards the 2% target as the Brexit-induced weakness in the pound starts to fade. Yet despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news on wages, sustained growth could prove harder to come by. Conventional economic theory - the Phillips curve - suggests that with unemployment as low as it is, sooner or later demand for labour will outstrip supply and workers will be able to demand higher wages. However a fundamental shift in the labour market has led this relationship to break down, meaning wages remain depressed despite low unemployment. The cause seems to be a lack of underlying inflationary pressure, combined with technological developments and global competition which has weakened the bargaining power of the worker. Throw continuing lacklustre productivity growth into the mix too, and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction of 3% wage growth by next year could look optimistic. All this has implications for interest rates. If unemployment can fall further without causing wage inflation, there is absolutely no pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates. The unemployment rate of 4.4% is the lowest since March-May 1975: And here are the changes in the number of jobs by sector: Sterling has edged higher after the stronger than expected wages growth figures. The pound is now up 0.19% against the dollar at $1.2892, and against the euro it is 0.21% higher at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0986. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The UK wages growth surprised on the upside, as the British households saw their average earnings improved by 2.1% (3 month-on-year) versus 1.8% anticipated by analysts. Still, consumer prices rose by 2.6% over the same month. Although, the divergence between the price and wages growth will likely continue weighing on British households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power and cool down the inflationary pressures, the Bank of England (BoE) hawks will remain alert on the economic data as long as the rates remain at the historical low levels. The pound-bulls came back in charge following the solid wages growth. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: More detail on the jobless numbers. There were 32.07 million people in work, 125,000 more than for January to March 2017 and 338,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 1.48 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 57,000 fewer than for January to March 2017 and 157,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 883,000 people (not seasonally adjusted) in employment on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their main job, 20,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Breaking: Better news for householders, UK average earnings have come in higher than expected. Average weekly earnings rose by 2.1% year on year in the three months to June, better than the forecast 1.8%. Excluding bonuses the figure was also 2.1% compared to expectations of 2%. Meanwhile the July claimant count fell by 4,200 and the unemployment rate came in at 4.4%, better than the expected 4.5% and the lowest since 1975. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, does not plan to give any new monetary policy statements at the gathering of bankers at Jackson Hole in the US at the end of the month. Stephen Gallo, European head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said: This reinforces our view that the ECB is going to stagger the taper and normalisation process as much as possible so as to avoid a taper tantrum or anything of that nature. We will continue to favour selling rallies in EURUSD for the next month or so...At the July rate decision Draghi said announcements (on policy) would come in the autumn. The term autumn as opposed to a specific date gives the ECB flexibility. With some nervousness ahead of the UK wages and jobs data, sterling slipped to a ten month low against the euro before recovering slightly. The pound was trading at 91.44p a euro before edging back to 91.07p, a 0.12% decline. A Reuters report said dealers were speculating on a weaker than expected wage growth figure. The Italian economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, the same rate as the previous three months and in line with expectations. Domestic demand offset a weakening trade position, and analysts said the figures suggested the country would meet its 1.1% annual growth target. Over in Europe, there have been some better than expected economic growth figures from the Netherlands: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at what is expected from the imminent UK data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unchanged, if still high, UK inflation reading attention turns to the latest jobs report and, specifically, the state of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages. Including bonuses the average earnings index for the 3 months to June is expected to remain at 1.8%, meaning real wages are continuing to suffer under the tyranny of UK inflation (and explains Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected fall in retail sales). Elsewhere in the jobs report the unemployment rate will likely stay at 4.5% for the second month in a row, while the claimant count change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most up to date figure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is forecast to shrink from 5.9k to 3.2k. Away from Europe for the moment, and ratings agency S&amp;P has confirmed its view on Brazil after president Michel Temer survived a vote related to corruption charges. S&amp;P said: Since we placed our ratings on Brazil on CreditWatch with negative implications in May, the political landscape is somewhat more settled as President Temer survived a vote--by the Federal Electoral Court (TSE) in June and by Congress in August--related to corruption charges. Meanwhile, the economy appears to have stabilised despite fluid politics, Congress passed a labor reform in July, and the government remains committed to advancing some pension reform, containing expenditure growth to minimise deviation from its primary fiscal targets, and advancing its active microeconomic reform agenda. We are removing our long-term sovereign ratings on Brazil from CreditWatch with negative implications and affirming them at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We are also affirming our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 short-term sovereign ratings. The negative outlook, however, reflects ongoing political challenges and the risk of a downgrade over the next six to nine months--given Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high and rising debt burden--should Congress fail to advance legislation that begins to reduce Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal rigidities, which hinder deficit reduction and sustained moderation in spending growth. The week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market revival is continuing as investors put aside concerns about North Korea and indulge in a little bargain hunting. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened 0.6% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.4%. Wage growth is unlikely to pick up to 3% next year as the Bank of England is forecasting, says ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel, while the pound is likely to continue to come under pressure: The combination of lacklustre UK economic data and political noise has served to highlight the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerabilities this week and we expect these factors to further weigh on the currency. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot, but not too hot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 core inflation release yesterday has all but silenced any 2017 Bank of England rate hike calls; markets see a \u00e2\u2030\u02c620% chance of a 25bp rate increase by year-end. Those looking to wage growth as evidence for rising underlying price pressures are unlikely to find much support in the UK jobs report today. We expect average hourly earnings growth to remain unchanged at 2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stay pretty much anchored at this level for the rest of 2017. This might not come as too much of a surprise to markets given that it would be in line with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts outlined in the Aug Inflation Report. Yet, the bigger question is whether wage inflation can pick up to 3% in 2018 as the Bank predicts; such a sharp uplift in earnings growth is unlikely given signs of greater than anticipated slack in the labour market.. We expect the pound to remain on the back foot today, with the pound/dollar moving below the 1.2850/60 area and the euro/pound grinding higher towards 0.9140/50. Stock markets are expected to continue their recent mini-revival, as last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil amid the tensions between North Korea and the US fade further. (President Trump of course has other matters closer to home to deal with at the moment). Here are the opening calls from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Continuing evidence of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze is expected today with the latest wages and jobs data. Despite inflation unexpectedly holding steady at 2.6% rather than rising further, cash strapped households are likely to find little relief in the wages figures. They are expected to continue lagging the cost of living, with analysts predicting that average weekly earnings grew by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time. Stripping out bonuses, the figure is expected to hold steady at 2%. But Michael Hewson. chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says that wages growth has been on an upward trend: The most recent wages numbers saw weekly earnings excluding bonuses for June come in at 2%, up from 1.7% in May, an encouraging sign that we may have seen wages start to show signs of a rebound at a time when ILO unemployment is at and expected to remain at a 42 year low of 4.5%. With employment levels at record highs any signs of a tighter labour market could well offer the pound some significant support which means that a strong wages number today could offer the Bank of England that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario of falling inflation and rising wages and potentially move the debate back to the timing of a possible rate rise. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, disagrees: The divergence between the price and wages growth will likely continue weighing on the real wages and cool down the inflationary pressures as a consequence. Under these circumstances, the Bank of England will be in a position to keep the interest rates at the current historical low levels for an extended period of time and walk the UK businesses through challenging Brexit times. The pound seems undecided too, edging down just 0.05% against a recently revived dollar at $1.2862. Also coming up today are eurozone second quarter growth figures, expected to show an increase of 0.6%. This compares to a 0.3% rise in the UK in the second quarter.

The UK new car market declined 9.3% in July, according to figures published this month by the the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the fourth consecutive monthly fall. The SMMT said on Wednesday almost 4m used cars were sold in the first half of this year, down 5.1% on a year ago. Consumers got a glimpse of some respite this week from surging inflation after the vote to leave the European Union, as the consumer price index remained static at 2.6%, while pay growth showed signs of edging up after the lowest level of unemployment since the mid-1970s potentially handed workers more bargaining power. Lookers, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car dealership, said on Wednesday it viewed the second half of the year with caution and that new car sales would probably fall by 2.6% this year. It said the used car market represented a significant opportunity and that it had seen a 23% increase in leads generated by its website in the first half of 2017. There has been plenty of pressure on car sales in recent months, with consumers facing political uncertainty from the Brexit vote and Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap general election, while the government also put forward plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040 to encourage a shift to electric vehicles. Falling used car prices would trouble the Bank of England, as banks lending to customers buying new cars on hire purchase plans could be left with vehicles worth less than they had previously envisaged at the end of a deal. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said greater levels of interest in used cars as consumers tighten their belts could help protect the value of vehicles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we see the new car market cool, the secondhand market will probably do better, and in a sense that might support residual values of the cars coming onto the secondhand market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.",

Latest Office for National Statistics data show that total real average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5% in the three months to June, which was marginally down from a peak drop of 0.6% in May. Inflation will likely be close to 3% through the latter months of 2017, while earnings growth seems set to hover around 2%</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence is brittle and caution over making major purchases appears to have been reinforced by heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. </p> </blockquote> <p>However, there is cause for cause for cautious optimism looking into next year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The squeeze on consumers should progressively ease in 2018 due to inflation falling back markedly (as the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall drops out).

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it for the day and the big news came from the European Central Bank minutes and UK retail sales. ECB minutes revealed that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers are fretting about the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overshooting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against other currencies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern because a strong euro would make exports from the 19-nation single currency bloc less competitive. The release of the minutes sent the euro on a downward trajectory. In the UK, retail sales were up 0.3% month on month in July, slightly ahead of a forecast of 0.2%, an encouraging sign coming hot on the heels of an apparent easing of the cost of living squeeze. However June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figure was revised downwards from 0.6% to 0.3%. Elsewhere, European markets took a turn for the worse after a winning streak and the FTSE was down by mid-afternoon, after lacklustre results from B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher and Mecca Bingo owner Rank. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to put the blog back into hibernation. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back bright and early tomorrow with all the latest developments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian retail guru Sarah Butler with the full lowdown on Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sales rise for three years. In a note snappily titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eurozone: Between taper and tantrum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, analysts at Dutch bank ING have been unpicking those ECB minutes, which have put the euro on the slide. They are looking ahead to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole and think the minutes reflect cautiousness at the ECB about unwinding monetary stimulus. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes fit into the picture of an ECB which wants to steer and moderate the process towards tapering extremely cautiously. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reports that Mario Draghi would possibly not say anything new on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy at his speech at the Jackson Hole conference on 25 August had already given the same flavour. However, ING reckon this does not rule out the possibility of more subtle changes of tone at the ECB, most likely further towards the back end of the year. All of this means that in our view the ECB will take another baby step towards tapering at the September meeting. This could be done by putting more emphasis on the strong economic recovery which easily could do with somewhat less monetary stimulus and/or by using the well-known key phrase that the Governing Council has tasked the relevant committees to investigate several options for QE in 2018. Tapering will come but somehow the ECB itself does not yet entirely know when and how to do it. UK retail sales growth may have been pretty lacklustre in July but nobody has told Asda. The British supermarket, part of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer Wal-Mart, has reported its first underlying sales growth for three years. Like-for-like sales at the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest supermarket rose by 1.8% in its second quarter, helped by food price inflation and a comparison against a weak period last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still quite the turnaround from the first quarter, when sales were down 2.8%, the eleventh straight quarterly decline. Details of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting for July have been released. It seems policymakers are concerned about the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overshooting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the future. In other words they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried the euro may strengthen too much. The reason that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern is that the eurozone relies quite heavily on exports and a stronger euro could make those exports less attractive to buyers outside the 19-nation bloc. The euro hit a three-week low against the dollar after the ECB voiced its fears. The Federation of Small Businesses has taken a look at July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales and they are not impressed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the verdict of Mike Cherry, the FSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national chairman. Confidence among small retailers has plummeted over the first half of the year. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worryingly close to flat, or even negative, retail sales growth across the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With operating costs at their highest in four years, small business owners are paying themselves less, struggling to award pay rises and pushing up prices in an attempt to absorb increased outgoings. This threatens to further stifle already reduced consumer spending power. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflationary pressure, Brexit uncertainty and delays to business rates relief measures are making it almost impossible for small retailers to invest and plan for the future. In this unforgiving climate, the Government needs to carefully consider its inaugural Budget. Stealth tax grabs in the form of hikes to fuel duty and insurance premium tax will make a bad situation worse. A quick check on markets, currencies and commodities as we head towards noon. The FTSE100 is down 25 at 7407 after disappointing numbers from Kingfisher and Rank Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is 12 points lower at 122251, while the French CAC is off 8.6 points at 5168 Sterling is at $1.2858 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1694 Brent crude oil is flat at $50.24 per barrel The Guardian business desk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ace new economics correspondent Richard Partington has put some flesh on the bones of those UK retail sales figures. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his version of events. Time for a bit of light relief after those chewy retail sales figures. Harper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has published a transcript of the jury selection process in the trial of beleaguered pharmaceuticals chief executive Martin Shkreli, who was convicted of fraud earlier this month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that potential jurors were tough to find, with most already having formed some pretty strong opinions on Shkreli, who has been widely condemned after his company Turing raised the price of drugs for conditions including HIV/AIDS. More than two hundred were excused as a result. It started badly, with prospective Juror No 1 declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m aware of the defendant and I hate him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another candidate described Shkreli as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most hated man in America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while one felt incapable of being impartial because he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kind of looks like a d***\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But perhaps the most heinous accusation levelled at Shkreli by jurors was that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disrespected the Wu-Tang Clan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the influential New York hip-hop group that enjoyed a meteoric rise in the 1990s with their distinctive sound. Shkreli was the man who bought the sole copy of the Wu-Tang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special release \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once Upon A Time in Shaolin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for $2m in 2015, on the condition that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t release it for 88 years. Shkreli duly leaked it to celebrate Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, sparking a war of words with the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members including Ghostface Killah, who deemed him a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sh*thead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Of course, any fan of the hip-hop outfit could have told Shkreli that the Wu-Tang Clan Ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Nuthing Ta F\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Wit and advised him to Protect Ya Neck, or risk crying Tearz. Price rises in the 19 countries that share the euro currency held firm during July, with inflation sticking at 1.3% excluding energy and unprocessed food, according to the European statistics office Eurostat. Inflation remains below the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2% but has ticked up slightly on 1.2% in June and came in above analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 1.2%. We may get an indication later today of whether the ECB is moving towards an unwinding of its monetary stimulus programme, with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting minutes from July due to be published. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more detail on those lacklustre numbers from B&amp;Q and Screwfix owner Kingfisher. Analysts at AJ Bell have noted that despite Kingfisher being \u00c2\u00a3368m of the way through a \u00c2\u00a3600m share buyback, its stock has slumped to its lowest level since late 2014. The failure of this largesse to support the shares raises further questions over whether buybacks are a good value of creating long-term value for investors or not. Here comes Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, without whose analysis no retail sales release would be complete. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard the numbers, which were better than expected, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Howard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly gloomier take on the shape of things to come: The outlook for consumers looks set to be highly challenging over the latter months of the year, even though a modicum of relief has come from consumer price inflation easing back to 2.6% in July from a near four-year high of 2.9% in May. Real income growth is currently negative, and it looks likely to remain so through the rest of 2017. Latest Office for National Statistics data show that total real average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5% in the three months to June, which was marginally down from a peak drop of 0.6% in May. Inflation will likely be close to 3% through the latter months of 2017, while earnings growth seems set to hover around 2% Furthermore, consumer confidence is brittle and caution over making major purchases appears to have been reinforced by heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. However, there is cause for cause for cautious optimism looking into next year. The squeeze on consumers should progressively ease in 2018 due to inflation falling back markedly (as the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall drops out). However, earnings growth will likely remain relatively muted and employment may well lose momentum. Time for some reaction to those UK retail sales figures, which narrowly beat forecasts with a 0.3% rise. This is what Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, has to say: July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures were fairly encouraging given the recent intensification of the squeeze on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real incomes and suggest that talk of a sharp consumer slowdown has been overdone. Admittedly, the 0.3% monthly expansion in retail sales volumes (consensus 0.2%) was a bit weaker than the recent upbeat surveys had suggested. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the annual rate of sales volumes stood at just 1.3% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from 2.8% in June and considerably lower than the 5-6% rates seen towards the end of 2016. But with July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly rise in sales volumes building on June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust 0.6% increase, high-street spending appears to have carried a decent amount of momentum into Q3. There have been few signs of a sharp slowdown in spending growth away from the high street either. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wet weather might have dampened fashion sales but the supermarkets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continued creativity together with a good month for homewares meant it was another good month for retailers overall. While headline inflation may have eased back slightly recently, shoppers are still feeling the squeeze from several months of rising prices and sluggish wage growth. But despite consumers finding their purses a little lighter each month, the supermarkets continue to find ways to help shoppers adapt their spending rather than rein it in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c encouraging them to trade nights out for nights in and switch brands for own label, for example. July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales rose by 0.3% month-on-month according to the Office for National Statistics, above a Reuters consensus forecast of 0.2%. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were revised down from 0.6% to 0.3%, a fairly sizeable revision. Shoppers tightened their belts on most things except food, which was up 1.5%. Ole Black, the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 top statistician calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively subdued picture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given that sales in all sectors but food declined. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a graph from the Office for National Statistics showing the sectoral breakdown. A quick update on President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly fractious relationship with the US business community, which has seen him disband two business councils. Apple chief executive Tim Cook is the latest chief executive to voice his disapproval of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lacklustre response to the far right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manoeuvres in Charlottesville, Virginia. Here are some excerpts from an email to staff, leaked to Buzzfeed, in which Cook was pulling no punches. I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans. What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. He added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the wake of the tragic and repulsive events in Charlottesville, we are stepping up to help organisations who work to rid our country of hate. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s putting his money where his mouth is too. Apple will make two $1m donations, one to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the other to the Anti-Defamation League. The tech giant will also double any donations that its staff make to those organisations and any other human rights groups until September 30. While we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waiting for UK retail sales to drop, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of what looks likely to be one of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest business news stories, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadside at Amazon and growing friction with US captains of industry. With a single tweet, the President knocked $5bn off the Amazon share price. Amazon, of course, is run by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, never Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest cheerleader. You can tell that jobs are important to President Trump thanks to the capital letters and exclamation marks in the tweet immediately preceding the assault on Amazon. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the US business world is looking fragile after he disbanded his business advisory council of chief executives, after many of them fled for the exit in the light of his response to the violence surrounding a far right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have another look ahead to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales figures, due for release by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am. The British shopper is a hardy soul, not likely to be deterred by global concerns such as the threat of nuclear war, the rise of the far right in the US, or the impending four-year absence of Big Ben\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bongs. This resilience in the face of adversity is one reason why pundits expect a rise, albeit a modest one of 0.2%, in July retail sales. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slowdown on 0.6% in June but any increase is better than nothing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one more comment from Michael Hewson at CMC Markets:- The squeeze on consumer incomes has been particularly apparent in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data which got off to a poor start in Q1, but did improve somewhat in Q2, with a decent rebound at the end of the quarter. As Q3 gets underway there is some optimism that the July numbers will also show an improvement, if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BRC retail sales numbers are any guide. They do tend to act as a leading indicator to the official numbers, and show a modest improvement last week, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales numbers expected to show a rise of 0.2%, down from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% The FTSE has been open nearly 10 minutes now and is down around 15 points at 7417, after Kingfisher reported a worse-than-expected second quarter performance for its DIY chain B&amp;Q. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Panmure Gordon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s veteran City analyst David Buik with a brief glimpse at the numbers. And there was nothing to shout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about either at Mecca Bingo owner Rank Group, where full year pre-tax profit is down 7% to \u00c2\u00a379.7m on revenues broadly flat at \u00c2\u00a3707m. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has been reading the runes regarding the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans, with one eye on the meeting of central bank minds at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole symposium. We saw a another decent day for European markets yesterday helped in no small part by a report citing European Central Bank sources that ECB President Mario Draghi would not be making any references to monetary policy at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole annual central bank symposium. This helped push the euro towards its lowest levels this month against the US dollar, while helping support European stocks. Speculation had been building that we might get an early steer on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intentions with respect to the slow winding down of the banks \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn a month stimulus program. The report went on to say that any discussion would have to wait until the autumn, which suggests that we may well have to wait until the October meeting, before the ECB looks at showing its hand, on the timing of any tapering program. Stock markets in Europe have been on something of a winning streak of late but that looks like it might come to an end today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red ink across the board, according opening calls from the folks at IG. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. July retail sales due for release at 9.30am will give us an inkling of how the UK consumer is faring given the ongoing squeeze on household incomes, which persists despite inflation coming in lower than expected earlier this week. Eurozone inflation data is out half an hour later at 10am. Monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic is also in focus, after minutes of the Federal Reserve came out last night indicating a divide over when to raise rates. European Central Bank minutes are due for release at 12.30pm today, with analysts watching out for some sign of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn-a-month stimulus programme being unwound. In the City, there are are financial performance figures from casino and bingo firm Rank and Kingfisher, the group behind DIY brand B&amp;Q.

Craig Erlam , senior market analyst at Oanda, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump has been no stranger to controversy in his short time as President but the latest entirely unnecessary and avoidable situation could prove quite costly for him. Trump has already this week been forced to dissolve his manufacturing council and the strategic and policy forum, while his infrastructure council never even got off the ground, after numerous CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrew from the initiatives due to his response to the white supremacy rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c190448d6a64f24fb99b8d8d0dea022c937239bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c190448d6a64f24fb99b8d8d0dea022c937239bc/0_244_4812_2887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"National Economic Council director Gary Cohn (left) at President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure press conference earlier this week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">National Economic Council director Gary Cohn (left) at President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure press conference earlier this week</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The next casualty could be the most costly of the lot, with speculation growing that Gary Cohn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key figurehead in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform and spending initiatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could resign from his position as National Economic Council Director. This would be a bitter blow for Trump and be the icing on the cake of what has been a dreadful week for the President. The negativity is flowing through to the markets as well as such a move would cast doubt over whether Trump will deliver on his tax reform and spending promises in the foreseeable future, two things that have been at least partly responsible for the post-election rally in the markets.</p> </blockquote> <p>So far there is no sign that former Goldman Sachs president Cohn plans to leave - and indeed the White House has said he is staying.

It is important to point out, however, that the pound is still seriously struggling against the latter (the currency is trapped below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.10) and has begun to flag against the former, falling from an early August, 11 month high of $1.326 to its current sub-$1.29 levels. </p> <p>Looking to this afternoon and the Dow Jones is set to open flat at 21750 when the bell rings on Wall Street.

We believe the ruling elite of [North Korea] is rational and has a strong sense of self-preservation. Still, after ratcheting up tensions with little to show for it, the regime could underestimate the risks of a more dramatic provocation in the hope of winning some concessions.

As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the last couple of years in Europe, these kinds of atrocities affect tourism and will hit airline earnings. Investors are concerned that demand will fall over the rest of the year, which was already looking like it would be a tough patch for the industry.</p> <p>Airlines are already dealing with a price war and several have warned about the second half. The attacks in Spain will do nothing to help and should hit earnings, although we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know to what extent until the quarterly updates come in.</p> <p>Falling demand is not going to help falling fares. Ryanair thinks average fares will decline by 8% in the second half. The industry is good at competing away any margin accretion by creating more capacity. Now firms will probably have to contend with lower demand in key Spanish routes. </p> <p>IAG and EasyJet both shed 3% in early trading, while Ryanair was 5% lower on the open before paring losses. These were the biggest fallers as European stocks took a nose dive after US stocks dived yesterday on concerns about the Donald Trump presidency. On a risk-off day, the only risers are miners and insurers.</p> <p>But if the lesson from previous terror attacks is anything to go by, whilst airlines and maybe some luxury goods stocks can expect to see earnings hit, the broader market is capable of rebounding reasonably quickly.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59969866e4b06863e21fb870\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T07:40:49.884Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Spanish market, inevitably, is also among the losers.

This follows yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp sell-off on Wall Street which saw the major indices log some of their biggest daily losses so far this year.</p> <p>The move mimics that from last week.

                "bodyText":"The terror attacks in Barcelona and continuing concerns about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency have put stock markets under a fair bit of pressure on the last trading day of the week. European markets opened lower, following the overnight lead from Wall Street and Asia. Airline shares have been among the biggest fallers, on fears these latest attacks could prove another blow to tourism. Meanwhile investors turning away from equities are heading into safer areas such as the Japanese yen and gold. Elsewhere S&amp;P has kept its AA rating on South Korea despite the recent belligerence from its northern neighbour, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe a direct armed conflict is unlikely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The current state of play on the markets sees the FTSE 100 nearly 1% or 71 points lower, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.3%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac off 0.9% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex falling 0.75%. The European travel and leisure index is 1.1% lower, partly reflecting the falls in airline and tourism stocks. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open virtually unchanged. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again on Monday. More to watch out for next week - events at the Bank of England: One of the other factors relating to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns about the Trump presidency is talk that (another) key advisor may leave. Craig Erlam , senior market analyst at Oanda, explains: Trump has been no stranger to controversy in his short time as President but the latest entirely unnecessary and avoidable situation could prove quite costly for him. Trump has already this week been forced to dissolve his manufacturing council and the strategic and policy forum, while his infrastructure council never even got off the ground, after numerous CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrew from the initiatives due to his response to the white supremacy rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend. The next casualty could be the most costly of the lot, with speculation growing that Gary Cohn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key figurehead in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform and spending initiatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could resign from his position as National Economic Council Director. This would be a bitter blow for Trump and be the icing on the cake of what has been a dreadful week for the President. The negativity is flowing through to the markets as well as such a move would cast doubt over whether Trump will deliver on his tax reform and spending promises in the foreseeable future, two things that have been at least partly responsible for the post-election rally in the markets. So far there is no sign that former Goldman Sachs president Cohn plans to leave - and indeed the White House has said he is staying. But the speculation is adding to the mood of uncertainty in the markets. European markets are showing little signs of recovering. The FTSE 100 is now down around 1% or 72 points, Germay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.5%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 1.1% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 1% lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was no let-up this Friday morning, the European indices continuing to fall in the aftermath of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atrocities in Spain. Though the likes of easyJet and IAG \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had both been down more than 3% early in the session \u00e2\u20ac\u201c saw their losses reduce by a half and a third respectively, the FTSE itself only got worse as the day went on. Sterling, on the other hand, benefited from the issues in the US and the Eurozone... It is important to point out, however, that the pound is still seriously struggling against the latter (the currency is trapped below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.10) and has begun to flag against the former, falling from an early August, 11 month high of $1.326 to its current sub-$1.29 levels. Looking to this afternoon and the Dow Jones is set to open flat at 21750 when the bell rings on Wall Street. While it would appear that the Dow is, perhaps understandably, avoiding the kind of losses seen in Europe, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in part because it suffered its own 1.2% plunge yesterday evening. After months of the dollar bearing the brunt of the Trump-chaos the US indices finally seem to be turning on the President, likely due to the fact that the North Korea and Charlottesville controversies have helped kick the market-lifting infrastructure and tax promises further into the distance. The yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a haven in times of uncertainty has helped push the Japanese currency higher against the dollar. The combination of the latest terror attacks and continuing concerns about the stability of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency has seen the yen gain 0.5% against the dollar. Meanwhile the euro gained ground after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses when the minutes from the European Central Bank warned of an overshoot in the single currency. The pound is currently virtually unchanged against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0975 but up 0.19% against the dollar at $1.2887. Here are the eurozone construction figures: More on the fall in airline shares. British Airways owner International Airlines Group and low-cost carrier easyJet are both down around 2%, albeit off their lows, following the Spanish terror attacks. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Unsurprisingly we are seeing the airlines leading the FTSE lower this morning, in the aftermath of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrorist attack in Barcelona. In London, Paris and now Barcelona, the terrorist attacks over recent years have taken place in the three most visited cities in Europe, with inevitable implications for numbers over the coming year. With Turkish tourism numbers finally coming back, the focus on top European cities will arguably be a bigger hit to low cost European carriers if people decide to stay away. With the Spanish attack and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widely-reviled response to the events at Charlottesville, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about North Korea have been overtaken for the moment. But ratings agency S&amp;P reckons there is nothing much to worry about anyway. Repeating its AA rating on South Korea, it said: Although geopolitical tensions have risen of late in the Korean peninsula, we believe a direct armed conflict is unlikely. [North Korea] appears to have achieved significant improvements in its weapons technology in the past few months. Nevertheless, we view the likelihood of the North Korean regime provoking a major armed conflict on the peninsula to be low. This is based on our opinion that such an event would very likely destabilise North Korea politically and bring no benefit to the country. But it did warn: That said, the risk of an unintended military conflict has risen from a low level. We believe the ruling elite of [North Korea] is rational and has a strong sense of self-preservation. Still, after ratcheting up tensions with little to show for it, the regime could underestimate the risks of a more dramatic provocation in the hope of winning some concessions. On the other side, the U.S. may be less patient in responding to North Korean provocations than before, now that it views the country as being close to achieving inter-continental nuclear strike capability. In this situation, a miscalculation by either side of this standoff could spark a direct military conflict. However it is positive on the South Korean economy: Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record of steady economic growth has generated a prosperous economy, a high degree of fiscal and monetary flexibility, and a solid external position. We are affirming our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 long-term and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-1+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 short-term sovereign credit ratings on Korea. The stable outlook reflects our expectations that geopolitical risks in the Korean peninsula will not escalate over the next two years beyond what we observed since the last leadership transition in [North Korea] in 2011. And South Koreans will know how to celebrate this news: Gold is not the only haven gaining ground in the wake of the latest terror attack and the concerns about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank said: Investors are switching to risk-off mode, fleeing into safe haven assets. Gold reversed early-week losses, rising more than 2% since Tuesday. Demand for treasury bonds soared. 10-year German Bund yields dipped to 0.40%, while the 2-year slid to -0.71%. So did demand for higher yielding currencies such as the Aussie and the Kiwi. AUD/USD rose 0.45% while NZD/USD was up 0.50%. The Japanese yen was up 0.40%. Gold is moving higher as investors seek havens in the wake of the current uncertainties. The precious metal is up $6 an ounce to $1293, its highest level since early June. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122e the eurozone current account for June: It may be a summer lull in the business world in many ways but there are still a few key events to come, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick preview of next week from IHS Markit: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, on the fall in airline shares: Airlines bore the brunt of a risk-off turn on the open, with shares in Ryanair, IAG, Air France KLM, Lufthansa and EasyJet all slumping following the terror attacks in Spain. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the last couple of years in Europe, these kinds of atrocities affect tourism and will hit airline earnings. Investors are concerned that demand will fall over the rest of the year, which was already looking like it would be a tough patch for the industry. Airlines are already dealing with a price war and several have warned about the second half. The attacks in Spain will do nothing to help and should hit earnings, although we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know to what extent until the quarterly updates come in. Falling demand is not going to help falling fares. Ryanair thinks average fares will decline by 8% in the second half. The industry is good at competing away any margin accretion by creating more capacity. Now firms will probably have to contend with lower demand in key Spanish routes. IAG and EasyJet both shed 3% in early trading, while Ryanair was 5% lower on the open before paring losses. These were the biggest fallers as European stocks took a nose dive after US stocks dived yesterday on concerns about the Donald Trump presidency. On a risk-off day, the only risers are miners and insurers. But if the lesson from previous terror attacks is anything to go by, whilst airlines and maybe some luxury goods stocks can expect to see earnings hit, the broader market is capable of rebounding reasonably quickly. The Spanish market, inevitably, is also among the losers. The Ibex is currently down 1.1%, but has recovered a little from its worst levels. It is no wonder investors are shying away from equities, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo: European equities and US stock index futures have begun today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session on the back foot. This follows yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp sell-off on Wall Street which saw the major indices log some of their biggest daily losses so far this year. The move mimics that from last week. Back then investors dumped equities after President Trump responded to North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to fire missiles towards Guam with a couple of bellicose tweets. This time round investors have a clutch of excuses for cutting their exposure to equities. Most immediately is the apparent melt-down of the Trump administration as policymakers and insiders rush to damn the president for his comments over the violence at Charlottesville. The concern is that Trump has managed to alienate so many people now that he will never garner the support to push through his promised agenda of tax cuts, regulatory reform and infrastructure spending. Secondly, there are the Spanish terrorist atrocities to consider, something which unnerves confidence in the current febrile atmosphere. Thirdly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that geopolitical tension builds again as the US and South Korea undertake military manoeuvres in the Pacific next week. Finally, the second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with a raft of disappointing retail numbers. All-in-all, this seems like a good time to book profits, cut back one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity exposure and wait for a better opportunity to reinvest. Renewed worries about tourism in the wake of the Barcelona attacks have sent the European travel and leisure sector index down 1.4% in early trading. Following the Barcelona attacks, markets have opened sharply lower. The FTSE 100 is down 0.66%, with airlines easyJet and International Airlines Group leading the fallers on fears about the effect the attacks may have on tourism. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 0.9% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB 0.95% lower. Even this early in the day, Heineken directors may well be raising a glass after the Competition Commission gave the go-ahead to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3403m purchase of 1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns. There were concerns about the impact on the ranges of cider and beer supplied to pubs in 33 local areas, but the regulator has accepted Heineken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to sell pubs in the affected areas. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The recent brief revival in stock markets has come to a grinding halt, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency descends into further confusion and the Barcelona attacks revive terrorism fears. In the US, Wall Street suffered its second biggest drop of the year, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.24% lower - its largest one day fall in three months - the S&amp;P 500 off 1.54% and Nasdaq Composite down nearly 2%. In Asia the Nikkei 225 was down more than 1% and the Hang Seng 0.5% lower. European markets are also expected to open down: The negative reaction to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the events in Charlotteville continued with a third business panel scrapped, casting more doubt on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push through any of his infrastructure or tax proposals. So investors were already pulling out of equities and into havens such as the Swiss franc, the yen and gold, and the slide intensified once the news of the Spanish attacks began filtering through. On Trump, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: For several months US markets have managed to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt with respect to the implementation of some form of fiscal or tax reform, particularly since he appeared to have the support of the business community, and for the most part, many in the Republican Party. This confidence appears to be slowly melting away given recent events that have taken place in the aftermath of Charlottesville, as US politics descends into parody. The mass resignations from the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business advisory councils followed by their dissolution, and the subsequent heavy criticism from fellow Republicans appears to show a US President more isolated than at any time in his short Presidency....With support peeling away from all sides, investors appear to be coming to the conclusion that the US President is likely to find it even more difficult to achieve anything close to what was expected than was the case at the beginning of this year. This of course then begs the question as to whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to achieve anything at all, at a time when the political cost of continuing to support him rises with each passing day and each tweet storm.

During his election campaign, the president said she should be ashamed of herself for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, but later he praised her for doing a good job.</p> <p>But that does not mean he will give her another term once her current one is up in February.</p> <p>And perhaps ironically, the White House economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn is the favourite to replace Yellen. Ironic, because at the end of last week it was suggested that Cohn might quit his current post following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-criticised reaction to the events in Charlottesville.</p> <p>But a survey by the National Association for Business Economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c admittedly conducted before the violence in Charlottesville \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showed a majority thought that Yellen would not be nominated for a second term.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets have a cautious tone ahead of some key events later in the week. North Korean tensions could be on the rise again as the US and South Korea begin military exercises, while on the economic front, all eyes will be on the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers. Observers will be looking for clues about any easing off of quantitative easing programmes, but meanwhile a former senior Treasury official has described QE as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like heroin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit was worse than expected in 2015, according to new figures, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could grow faster than initial forecasts, says the Bundesbank. On the corporate front, a Chinese company is said to be interested in Fiat Chrysler, while Total is paying $7.5bn for Maersk Oil to boost its presence in the North Sea. The German chancellor Angela Merkel has hit out at bonuses paid to chief executives of car companies in the wake of the emissions scandal. On the markets, the FTSE 100 is virtually unchanged, down just 0.04%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.36% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 0.32%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit in 2015 was bigger than originally thought, according to new government figures. Reuters has the details: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit, the largest of any major economy last year, was even bigger in 2015 than previously thought, according to new estimates from the Office for National Statistics. The current account deficit has been in the spotlight since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on leaving the European Union, and although it has narrowed recently is not far off levels that would trigger a currency crisis in a less developed economy. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in the run-up to the referendum that Britain was reliant on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kindness of strangers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, highlighting how the country needed tens of billions of pounds of foreign finance a year to balance its books. The ONS said on Monday it now estimated the current account deficit was 98 billion pounds in 2015, equivalent to 5.2 percent of gross domestic product, compared with its previous estimate of 80 billion pounds or 4.3 percent of GDP. Much of the increase stemmed from new methodology that showed British companies paid out more interest to foreign holders of corporate bonds than initially estimated, resulting in a larger current account deficit. The revisions come more than a year after the government published a review of the ONS by former Bank of England deputy governor Charles Bean, who said many of its statistics were showing their age - especially in capturing the digital economy. An ex-Treasury official \u00e2\u20ac\u201c formerly the most senior civil servant at the department \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has described the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money printing programme as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like heroin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and called for its end. Lord Macpherson of Earls Court, who was permanent secretary to the Treasury from 2005 to 2016 and oversaw the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s introduction of quantitative easing as a response to the financial crisis in 2009, tweeted today: The European Central Bank is pondering how to move away from its own quantitative easing programme, while the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin unwinding its positions later this year. But there is no sign so far of the Bank of England following suit. Four years ago Lord Macpherson told a committee of MPs there was uncertainty in Whitehall as to whether a move at the time to increase QE was the right thing to do. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident that QE has had a positive effect but in one sense this is an experiment and we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the ultimate answer for many years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we set it up we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate that quantitative easing would last quite as long as it has nor did we anticipate that quite such a large fund would be built up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could grow faster than expected this year, according to economist at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank. The Bundesbank had previously predicted 1.9% growth in 2017. But with a strong start to the year - 0.7% GDP growth in the first three months, 0.6% in the second quarter - it says in its latest monthly report: The Bundesbank believes that the German economy is likely to continue to grow with strong momentum in the current quarter, too. This is suggested.. by the exceptionally upbeat sentiment among both enterprises and consumers as well as the positive order situation in the industrial sector. The underlying pace of economic activity, which was already quite strong in the previous year owing to buoyant domestic activity, recently accelerated again given a more favourable external environment, the report continues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, GDP growth in the current year could even be somewhat stronger than expected in the June projection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, write the Bundesbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists. In early June, the Bundesbank projected a 1.9% rise in calendar-adjusted GDP for 2017. Good news for Angela Merkel as she campaigns for the forthcoming elections. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on Janet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, seem to flipflop between disdain and admiration. During his election campaign, the president said she should be ashamed of herself for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, but later he praised her for doing a good job. But that does not mean he will give her another term once her current one is up in February. And perhaps ironically, the White House economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn is the favourite to replace Yellen. Ironic, because at the end of last week it was suggested that Cohn might quit his current post following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-criticised reaction to the events in Charlottesville. But a survey by the National Association for Business Economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c admittedly conducted before the violence in Charlottesville \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showed a majority thought that Yellen would not be nominated for a second term. Of those who expected a different face at the top of the Fed, Cohn was by far the favourite. Bloomberg has the details here. The Total deal to buy Maersk Oil for $7.5bn will boost the French company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence in the North Sea, making it the second largest player in the area. And it is not the only big deal in the sector today. Essar Oil has sold its India assets to a consortium led by Rosneft for $12.9bn. The deal will be the largest by a foreign company in India. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor said: The deal announced this morning between Total and Maersk Oil and completion of the Rosneft and Essar Oil deal confirm how Big Oil is having to look to consolidation to achieve access to additional capacity outside the US, having failed to invest in new production over the past few years. The collapse in oil prices from over $100 per barrel in May 2014 to under $30 in January 2016 forced oil companies to cut their spending to the bone and these decisions dramatically reduced future production. However, with a moderate recovery in oil prices and a significant improvement in cash flows, oil majors are on the prowl, looking to buy assets to improve production levels and deliver excess returns and profits. Sterling is just about holding steady against the other major currencies at the moment after its worst week since early June, but the currency remains under pressure. It is marginally lower against the dollar at $1.2870, having earlier fallen as low as $1.2851. Against the euro, it is up 0.1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0959. Investors are nervous about the progress of Brexit talks, while the chances of an imminent interest rate rise have been dropping sharply. Back with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in Fiat Chrysler: German chancellor Angela Merkel has criticised bonuses for car executives in the wake of the emissions scandal in an interview with Bild. Reuters reports: Multi-million euro bonuses to German car company executives are not fair given the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tarnished image after the emissions scandal, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this is fair. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the automotive industry is going to respond,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Merkel told mass-selling Bild newspaper in an interview broadcast live online. She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have supervisory boards on which union representatives sit and I think there should be a more sensitive approach (to executive bonuses)\u00e2\u20ac\u0153. Merkel said it was not up to politicians to cap executive pay and bonuses. Earlier the German finance ministry said the scandal was a risk to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: Fiat Chrysler shares have accelerated 3% following reports that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Great Wall Motor was interested in bidding for the carmaker. Reuters has quoted a Great Wall spokesman as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We currently have an intention to acquire. We are interested in [Fiat Chrysler].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Chinese company is apparently particularly interested in Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeep brand, and perhaps only Jeep. Automotive News quoted a spokesman saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our goal is to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest SUV [sports utility vehicle] maker. Acquiring Jeep, a global SUV brand, would enable us to achieve our goal sooner and better (than on our own).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More on the Maersk Oil deal. Reuters reports: Total is buying Maersk Oil in a $7.45 billion deal which the French oil major said would boost its earnings and cash flow, and bolster its dividend prospects. Danish company AP Moller Maersk is selling its Maersk Oil division to Total to focus on other activities including its shipping business. Under the terms of the deal, A.P. Moller Maersk will get $4.95 billion in Total shares and Total will assume $2.5 billion of Maersk Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt. Maersk said it plans to return a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material portion of the value of the received Total S.A. shares\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to shareholders in 2018 and 2019 in the form of extraordinary dividend, share buyback or distribution of shares in Total. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top oil companies have been back on the takeover trail over the last year, helped by signs of a recovery in the oil market. The sale comes with Maersk in the midst of a major restructuring to concentrate on its transport and logistics businesses and separate its energy operations in the face of a drop in income. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This transaction is immediately accretive to both cash flow and earnings per share and delivers further growth over coming years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is in line with our announced strategy to take advantage of the current market conditions and of our stronger balance sheet to add new resources at attractive conditions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. BP announced a string of investments in the last two months of 2016, including a $1 billion partnership with Dallas-based Kosmos Energy in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa, as well as acquisitions in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan. Total and Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Statoil have bought into Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lucrative sub-salt deepwater oil fields while ExxonMobil Corp bought assets in Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas. In July, Total also said it was investing $3.5 billion over five years in Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offshore Al Shaheen oilfield . Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danske Bank on the forthcoming Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers: ECB president Mario Draghi is set to be among the speakers for the first time in three years. In 2014, he hinted at QE and now the focus is on tapering signals. We expect him to deliver a dovish message and to not give any new communication on the issue of tapering of asset purchases. When it comes to the Fed, we do not expect anything dramatic. We look for a repeat of signals that the announcement on balance sheet reduction will come relatively soon (likely September) and that one more rate hike is still the base case this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as signalled by vice president Bill Dudley last week. It is a key year for oil and gas companies, according to analysts at Barclays: We see the next 12 months as a critical period for the oil and gas industry and one that should see companies getting back to covering dividends and reducing debt organically. As such, over the coming year, we see competitive performance as a crucial determinant of value creation and this report is our annual assessment of the operational and financial performance of the integrated companies over a 25-year history. It allows us to align companies to differing quartiles of performance and assess whether they are appropriately valued. We conclude that there is still material value in the large cap oils, with our preference towards those stocks with lower break-evens and more potential to re-rate over the next 12 months. Our key overweight stocks are BP, Conoco, Exxon, OMV and Shell. News of a major oil deal has helped to limit some of the market falls. The Danish shipping company Moller-Maersk has announced it will sell its oil and gas division, Maersk Oil, to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total for $7.45bn. It plans to return a large part of the proceeds to shareholders, which has helped to push its shares up around 5%. As expected, investors appear to be keeping their powder dry at the start of the new trading week. In keeping with the gloomy weather in London at the moment, the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.1%, with banks among the biggest fallers. But mining shares are moving higher, with BHP Billiton leading the way ahead of its results on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex all opened 0.5% lower, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.27%. The dollar has been under pressure recently, not least because of the car-crash that is US politics at the moment. It seems a bit calmer this morning, edging away from four month lows against the yen. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, believes that any respite for the US currency could be short-lived: There is little love lost for the dollar right now, with the currency fast becoming a sell on the current White House drama. It is a bit strange to see both speculative and actual personnel changes within the White House causing such a stir for global markets, though we may be able to put this down to summer markets. Still, we prefer to focus on the broader economic implications of US politics and what this means for the dollar. In addition to diminishing odds of any pro-growth policies from the Trump administration, we believe the narrative is shifting towards political uncertainty having a dampening effect on business confidence and investment activity. Given that US political environment remains frenetic, the risk relief rally seen late on Friday may prove to be short-lived and this could well keep the dollar pinned down over the coming weeks. The pound meanwhile is edging lower against the dollar as the US currency stabilises for the moment. With the continuing uncertainty over Brexit terms, sterling is down 0.16% at $1.2850. Against the euro it is virtually unchanged at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0946. Oil is slipping back on worries that increasing US production could outweigh attempts by Opec to curb output and support crude prices. Brent is currently down 0.19% at $52.62 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is 0.1% lower at $48.46. Traders will be keeping an eye on an Opec technical meeting today. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: [At the meeting] nations are expected to ensure compliance with output cuts to prevent prices from diving again. Satisfactory comments could encourage a further recovery in oil prices. In Asia the Nikkei 225 is down around 0.4%, and European markets are forecast to open lower: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are in a cautious mood amid continuing political tensions and ahead of a big week for central bankers. Worries about North Korea were put on the backburner last week amid the continuing turmoil at the White House and the terrorist attacks in Spain. But they could be back in focus with the US and South Korea holding military exercises this week. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Europe is set for a slightly negative start on Monday, threatening to extend its losing streak to three sessions as political and geopolitical risk continue to weigh on risk appetite. Geopolitical risk could rear its ugly head again this week as the US and South Korea begin planned military exercises on Monday, just as tensions between the North and these two countries appear to have calmed. Should North Korea respond in kind, then we could see a repeat of the safe haven rush from a couple of weeks ago when the situation previously flared up between the countries. US markets closed lower for the second week in succession as President Trump faced criticism for his response to the events in Charlottesville. But news that his adviser Steve Bannon was leaving his role at the White House gave a late lift to Wall Street on Friday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: We did see a late rebound off the lows late on Friday when it was announced that Steve Bannon, one of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest advisers, had left the administration. It was well known that there was tension amongst him and some other members of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top team, including chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. There had been some uncertainty surrounding the future of Cohn, in the wake of recent events in Charlottesville, and the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure unequivocally to condemn the violence of the far right, particularly given Cohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own Jewish ancestry. The departure of Cohn would have been a hammer blow to the president, on top of all the other recent resignations, which suggests there may well have been a hint of political calculation behind Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. Bannon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure buys Trump time when he is starting to look isolated and even a little beleaguered. The big question is how we move on from here and whether the president still has the authority to move forward on any key policy areas, such as tax reform. There are indeed reports that Trump may now try and push through the long-promised tax reforms in an attempt to at least get some of his policies on the books. On the economic front, there is little to look forward to today. Most of the big news comes later in the week, not least with the Jackson Hole summit of central bankers in the US. Investors will be looking for any signs of further interest rate moves from the Fed, and any hints from the European Central Bank about a slow withdrawal of its bond buying programme. However, there have already been suggestions that the ECB president Mario Draghi is unlikely to say anything too informative. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hewson said: The scope for surprises was diminished somewhat by ECB sources at the end of last week when it was reported the ECB president Mario Draghi would not be making any comment on monetary policy when he speaks later this week. This reticence to comment may also have something to do with the fact that there appears to some concern on the governing council about an overshoot to the upside for the euro, particularly given the recent weakness of the US dollar. Here is our preview of the Jackson Hole event: Also on the agenda later in the week are French and German PPI numbers and the latest second quarter GDP figures from the UK.",

                "bodyText":"Lidl has overtaken Waitrose to become the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventh largest grocer as increasingly cash-strapped shoppers turn to the discounters. The German discount chain reached a new market share high of 5.2% as sales rose 18.9% in the 12 weeks to 13 August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making it the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fastest growing grocer, according to the latest market share data from analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Fellow discounter Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales rose by 17.2%, giving it a 7% market share. Aldi overtook Waitrose in 2015. The first British Lidl opened in 1994. The chain now has more than 650 stores nationwide after an ambitious expansion programme. Aldi is also rapidly opening new stores and some analysts believe the two grocers could more than double their market share from a combined figure of just over 12% to as much as a quarter of the market. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said many senior supermarket bosses were operating under that assumption. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These chains are destined to become very substantial indeed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

The proliferation of low-wage, irregular and insecure jobs means that wage pressures - and therefore spending power - are subdued even as unemployment falls.</p> <p>If policymakers wish to unwind QE, and bring interest rates back to their pre-crisis levels, they must do more to boost incomes on a structural basis. This means moving monetary policy away from exhausting a wealth effect stimulus, to generating demand that is sustainable.</p> <p>On the agenda for Jackson Hole should be the option of governments using money creation rather than borrowing to boost productive investment. Known as overt monetary financing, this idea is gaining support among leading economists like Adair Turner. Subject to credible central bank control, it could be an effective way of injecting demand directly into the real economy. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599d5976e4b0d26e26a9ea2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T10:39:46.268Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Worries about Brexit are among the factors contributing to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current woes.

Mario Draghi also highlighted the failure of the macro community to forecast the financial crisis, but how that too is being addressed.</p> <p>A year ago we argued that the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium had missed a trick in not focusing on why equilibrium real interest rates were so low and the potential role for fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries forward. That will likely be addressed later this week given the title of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fostering a dynamic global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>For the ECB it is clear that with the recovery continuing to broaden out (the PMIs were arguably consistent with a 0.5% GDP print in Q3) they will move to taper in 2018, and will be less focused on the exchange rate than many in the markets. When it comes to the ECB and QE and the exchange rate, the move in the currency has a habit of occurring well ahead of the event, with the currency falling before the bond buying commenced and then rising before the program is tweaked.</p> <p>More importantly at a global level the macro debate appears to have moved on, with more of a focus on fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries.

Commenting on the latest figures, ING Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bert Colijn said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Eurozone composite PMI increased from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing sector growth improved significantly and service sector growth decreased somewhat. Both sectors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 indices correspond to a healthy growth pace, but the question is whether this will also translate into an acceleration of industrial production this quarter.</p> <p>Manufacturing PMIs in the Eurozone have been buoyant for quite some time now, but industrial production has failed to improve from its modest growth trend of recent years. As most indicators point to further recovery of manufacturing activity, we do expect to see some improvements in growth for the months ahead. The backlogs of work in manufacturing increased the fastest in 11 years, for example, an indication that stronger manufacturing output in the coming months is likely.</p> <p>Even though service sector growth has been somewhat weaker recently, the fundamentals for continued strength in the second half of 2017 are still there. Consumption is supported by the employment recovery, which continued in August although the pace of hiring slowed somewhat. Still, employment growth indicated by businesses remains near decade highs. </p> <p>Price pressures continue to be weak, although selling prices did pick up according to businesses. Those selling prices reached a three-month high, but that does not mean that the Goldilocks economy is coming to an end anytime soon. As businesses indicated faster increases in selling prices earlier in the year, this will not convince the ECB that faster price growth is imminent ahead of Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. In fact, we think that improvements in inflation to above 1.5% are unlikely for the coming months, so look for a cautious Draghi at the end of the week.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599d3e21e4b0ee47ab0aeebf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T08:38:43.246Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers is, as we have already suggested, not expected to provide much in the way of fireworks from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mario Draghi. But what of US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen (who may well be leaving her post early next year and might want to spell out the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction of travel before that happens)? </p> <p>Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is tempting to view this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers as the moment where we move from an age of quantitative easing (QE) to that quantitative tightening (QT), which sees a smooth reduction of gilt buying from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key central banks. The US Federal Reserve is leading the charge, and we expect to get more detail from Janet Yellen on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QT plan, in order to slowly unwind its bloated balance sheet. We have confidence that the Fed has little desire to jolt the financial markets, but it and the market are in uncharted territory as unwinding a $4.5 trillion balance has never been done historically.</p> <p>Received wisdom has it that where the US leads the world follows and Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech will be closely monitored for an indication that the curtain is about to fall on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE experiment.</p> <p>However, the EU has very different challenges to the US economy and has not yet entered the rate rising environment that the US has. A firm signal that the ECB is to tread the same path as the Fed will precipitate volatility and Draghi will be keen to ensure that eurozone growth is not negatively impacted. Given the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper tantrum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience, we expect any pronouncements from Draghi to be guarded.

While in manufacturing the expansion seen in the second quarter of 2017 should continue, it seems that the expansion rhythm is slowing in the service sector, which could impact job creation. The labour market reform to be presented next week could shore up hiring intentions, but it is still far from a done deal.</p> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [manufacturing] PMI is a sign that the stronger than expected recovery in industrial production in the second quarter of 2017 (+1.2% quarter on quarter after -0.2% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2017) should continue in the second half of the year, boosted in part by the recovering building sector.</p> <p>The picture looks less rosy in the service sector, where the preliminary PMI shows a decline in August from 56.0 to 55.5. This would be its weakest reading since January. If activity is still expanding, a weaker pace would imply that the acceleration in job creation could encounter obstacles in coming months. For the moment, employment growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though improving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remains subdued.</p> <p>All in all, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs are an indication of the continuing recovery in France. French growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having slowed from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.1% in 2016 - is set to rebound to 1.5% in 2017.

At the lower bound, monetary accommodation cannot be provided through further reductions in short-term interest rates and policy must become non-standard.</p> <p>One option is to rely on forward guidance, i.e. to promise to keep interest rates low for longer in the future. Such commitments, if credible, lower longer-term interest rates and provide economic stimulus even if the current interest rate remains unchanged. While forward guidance is a useful instrument, recent research has highlighted that its effectiveness can be improved if combined with other non-standard monetary policies.</p> <p>Research in both academia and in central banks has therefore re-examined alternative monetary policy tools, including so-called quantitative easing (QE) policies. And here the newly developed models with financial frictions have been useful. Earlier studies based on the assumption of frictionless financial markets had concluded that QE is completely ineffective. The renewed focus on financial frictions clarified that this conclusion is unwarranted, once it is recognised that financial intermediaries are subject to leverage constraints. Large-scale asset purchases can ease these constraints and increase investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk-bearing capacity, leading to a portfolio rebalancing towards risky assets and to strengthened lending activity for banks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T07:34:10.281Z\">at 8.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-599d2b74e4b0d26e26a9e96d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-23T07:18:08.723Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets make uncertain start</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is a downbeat opening for European markets, as investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing geopolitical concerns - North Korea, Trump - and ahead of the central bankers meeting at Jackson Hole.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.1%, not helped by the drop in advertising giant WPP.

It will be scrutinised for any hints as to when the central bank might beginning withdrawing its economic stimulus package. The euro has been weak recently as uncertainty surrounds the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans, but it seems unlikely Draghi will give much away today, when it has already been suggested he will say little at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/20/global-investors-look-to-jackson-hole-for-signs-of-how-qe-will-end\">the key meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in the US</a> later this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile markets are expect to get off to a mixed start, as investors await the Jackson Hole bunfight. </p> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9% on hopes that President Trump would now move to push through tax reforms.

                "bodyText":"On the economic front, it was all eyes on Europe today. France saw its manufacturing sector move higher in August but services disappoint, while Germany continued to power ahead. So the overall eurozone economy recorded its best manufacturing performance since April 2011, although the service sector did let the side down a little. Elsewhere European Central Bank president Mario Draghi defended quantitative easing and forward guidance, but warned of further challenges ahead. Meanwhile the pound hit a new eight year low against the euro, partly due to the strong eurozone figures and partly due to continuing Brexit concerns. On the corporate front, WPP shares dropped sharply after the advertising group reported disappointing results. Stock markets are drifting lower, with the FTSE 100 currently down 0.14%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipping 0.33% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac falling 0.13%. The pound is 0.16% lower against the dollar at $1.2802 and down 0.42% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0854. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice graphic showing the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent decline: More on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall against the euro - how low can it go? Despite QE and low interest rates, central banks must do more to boost incomes, says Edward Smythe, economist at research and campaign group Positive Money: The likelihood of an exit from QE in the eurozone and elsewhere is diminished by the persistence of below-target inflation. The proliferation of low-wage, irregular and insecure jobs means that wage pressures - and therefore spending power - are subdued even as unemployment falls. If policymakers wish to unwind QE, and bring interest rates back to their pre-crisis levels, they must do more to boost incomes on a structural basis. This means moving monetary policy away from exhausting a wealth effect stimulus, to generating demand that is sustainable. On the agenda for Jackson Hole should be the option of governments using money creation rather than borrowing to boost productive investment. Known as overt monetary financing, this idea is gaining support among leading economists like Adair Turner. Subject to credible central bank control, it could be an effective way of injecting demand directly into the real economy. Worries about Brexit are among the factors contributing to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current woes. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After an incredibly flat start the pound took a dive this Wednesday, the currency infected by a bout of Brexit bearishness. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really been much to force sterling lower against the dollar and the euro. The former has admittedly seen something of a comeback this week following a fortnight of macro-economic losses; the latter, meanwhile, received a bit of a boost from a better than expected Eurozone manufacturing PMI (even if the services reading was worse than forecast). Yet neither fully explains why the pound is doing quite so badly. Cable has slipped under $1.28 for the first time since the end of June, while against the euro sterling has plunged another half a percent to hit a fresh 8 year nadir. With little else going on in the UK, it seems investors have been left to speculate about the state of the Brexit negotiations, rarely a good thing for the health of the pound. The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its sterling gains were joined by a 0.2% rise against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sapped the energy from the Eurozone indices, with the DAX and CAC now both down around 0.1%. As for the FTSE, the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miserable morning meant it could shrink its losses, though WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11% plunge meant the UK index was still down 0.2% And although Jackson Hole would be the perfect place for central bankers like Draghi to lay the foundation for upcoming policy moves it is by no means certain they will, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: If Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today are anything to go by we should not get our hopes up. Draghi steered well clear of upcoming monetary policy decisions and if reports last week are to be believed, he may well do so again on Friday. The ECB is clearly very concerned about the recent appreciation in the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite an insistence that it does not concern itself with such matters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and recent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinterpretations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by traders to Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments will likely mean he steers clear once again. The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current strength may not last if ECB boss Mario Draghi disappoints later this week at Jackson Hole: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for our monthly healthcheck on the UK economy following Brexit, and there are signs things are picking up although there are worries about the outlook. Richard Partington writes: Ministers are preparing for crucial Brexit talks this autumn against a backdrop of better news on jobs, inflation and the public finances as the UK economy displayed signs of stability after a volatile start to the year, a Guardian analysis shows. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly tracker of economic news shows inflation coming close to its peak and the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s. However, the ever-present threat that rocky negotiations could knock business confidence, derailing the economy, remains. The latest inflation figures confounded City economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for prices to resume an upward trajectory following an unexpected drop in June, while the UK also reported a surprise budget surplus in July, the first positive outturn for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances in that month since 2002. Meanwhile, spending on food helped to support growth in retail sales, despite a drop in spending across all other sectors, as consumers exercise more caution amid a squeeze on household budgets. But despite the positive signs for UK, defying the gloomiest forecasts ahead of the referendum for a Brexit recession, clouds are gathering as ministers prepare for more talks with Brussels after a summer lull. The full story is here: And here is the latest data: And the views of our two expert economists: Meanwhile there is little sign of recovery in sterling so far. It dipped below $1.28 against the dollar earlier for the first time since June and is still down 0.17% at $1.2802. Against the euro it is 0.3% lower at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0868. The pound may be weak at the moment but it could recover from here, says Yann Quelenn at Swissquote Bank; One boost will come from UK Q2 GDP figures, to be released Thursday morning. They are expected to show robust, solid growth of 1.7% (annualised). Brexit negotiations are making slow progress, but we think the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears of a Hard Brexit are overblown. The likelihood that all 27 remaining European Union member states will line up together against the UK is very low. (Indeed, the likelihood that they all line up together against anything is rather low.) The EU has a lucrative trading relationship with the UK, which it will not want to destroy. There may be GBP weakness in the medium term, as investors show nerves, but the longer-term outlook is bullish. Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech may have delivered little in terms of the future of QE but it was important in many respects, suggests David Owen, chief European financial fconomist at Jefferies: Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lindau Nobel laureate speech may not have directly addressed some of the markets current key concerns (how exactly the ECB intends to tweak its bond buying in 2018, the current level of the euro) but the speech was nevertheless important in stressing the role of academic research in driving the policy debate, both before well before the financial crisis, but more recently at the effective lower bound. Mario Draghi also highlighted the failure of the macro community to forecast the financial crisis, but how that too is being addressed. A year ago we argued that the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium had missed a trick in not focusing on why equilibrium real interest rates were so low and the potential role for fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries forward. That will likely be addressed later this week given the title of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fostering a dynamic global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For the ECB it is clear that with the recovery continuing to broaden out (the PMIs were arguably consistent with a 0.5% GDP print in Q3) they will move to taper in 2018, and will be less focused on the exchange rate than many in the markets. When it comes to the ECB and QE and the exchange rate, the move in the currency has a habit of occurring well ahead of the event, with the currency falling before the bond buying commenced and then rising before the program is tweaked. More importantly at a global level the macro debate appears to have moved on, with more of a focus on fiscal policy and structural reforms in driving recoveries. For the ECB the key thing is whether the recovery is continuing to broaden out, not the precise level of the euro. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comparison of eurozone PMIs and GDP: The rebound in the euro following the strong eurozone data has given another whacking to sterling. The pound is down 0.43% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0853, a new eight year low. The UK currency has already been under the cosh on concerns about the outcome of the protracted Brexit talks. The pound is also weaker against the dollar, down 0.19% at $1.2798. The lack of price pressures in the eurozone economy adds to the idea that Draghi will be cautious at Jackson Hole. Commenting on the latest figures, ING Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bert Colijn said: The Eurozone composite PMI increased from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing sector growth improved significantly and service sector growth decreased somewhat. Both sectors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 indices correspond to a healthy growth pace, but the question is whether this will also translate into an acceleration of industrial production this quarter. Manufacturing PMIs in the Eurozone have been buoyant for quite some time now, but industrial production has failed to improve from its modest growth trend of recent years. As most indicators point to further recovery of manufacturing activity, we do expect to see some improvements in growth for the months ahead. The backlogs of work in manufacturing increased the fastest in 11 years, for example, an indication that stronger manufacturing output in the coming months is likely. Even though service sector growth has been somewhat weaker recently, the fundamentals for continued strength in the second half of 2017 are still there. Consumption is supported by the employment recovery, which continued in August although the pace of hiring slowed somewhat. Still, employment growth indicated by businesses remains near decade highs. Price pressures continue to be weak, although selling prices did pick up according to businesses. Those selling prices reached a three-month high, but that does not mean that the Goldilocks economy is coming to an end anytime soon. As businesses indicated faster increases in selling prices earlier in the year, this will not convince the ECB that faster price growth is imminent ahead of Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Jackson Hole on Friday. In fact, we think that improvements in inflation to above 1.5% are unlikely for the coming months, so look for a cautious Draghi at the end of the week. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers is, as we have already suggested, not expected to provide much in the way of fireworks from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mario Draghi. But what of US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen (who may well be leaving her post early next year and might want to spell out the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction of travel before that happens)? Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said: It is tempting to view this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers as the moment where we move from an age of quantitative easing (QE) to that quantitative tightening (QT), which sees a smooth reduction of gilt buying from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key central banks. The US Federal Reserve is leading the charge, and we expect to get more detail from Janet Yellen on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QT plan, in order to slowly unwind its bloated balance sheet. We have confidence that the Fed has little desire to jolt the financial markets, but it and the market are in uncharted territory as unwinding a $4.5 trillion balance has never been done historically. Received wisdom has it that where the US leads the world follows and Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech will be closely monitored for an indication that the curtain is about to fall on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE experiment. However, the EU has very different challenges to the US economy and has not yet entered the rate rising environment that the US has. A firm signal that the ECB is to tread the same path as the Fed will precipitate volatility and Draghi will be keen to ensure that eurozone growth is not negatively impacted. Given the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper tantrum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience, we expect any pronouncements from Draghi to be guarded. On a relative basis, we continue to believe that US stocks are attractive compared to European equities, given that the country is over the initial hump caused by the move from QE to QT. A strong performance from the eurozone manufacturing sector has offset weak growth in services, according to an initial estimate of August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI rose from 56.6 in July to 57.4, better than the expected 56.3 and the highest level since April 2011. Eurozone factories were boosted by the best new export orders performance since February 2011. But the service sector PMI fell from 55.4 in July to 54.9, its weakest growth for seven months. Overall the composite index rose from 55.7 in July to 55.8, better than the expected dip to 55.5. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Harker said: The latest PMI readings for the eurozone signal a continuation of the recent strong performance of the currency bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. This stabilisation in the rate of expansion is pleasing, following signs of growth easing in recent months. IHS said the survey results suggested the eurozone economy would grow by 0.5% in the third quarter, down slightly from 0.6% in the previous three months. The dip in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector could be a cause for concern for jobs, said economist Julien Manceaux at ING Bank: Preliminary PMI data for August sent mixed signals this morning. While in manufacturing the expansion seen in the second quarter of 2017 should continue, it seems that the expansion rhythm is slowing in the service sector, which could impact job creation. The labour market reform to be presented next week could shore up hiring intentions, but it is still far from a done deal. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [manufacturing] PMI is a sign that the stronger than expected recovery in industrial production in the second quarter of 2017 (+1.2% quarter on quarter after -0.2% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2017) should continue in the second half of the year, boosted in part by the recovering building sector. The picture looks less rosy in the service sector, where the preliminary PMI shows a decline in August from 56.0 to 55.5. This would be its weakest reading since January. If activity is still expanding, a weaker pace would imply that the acceleration in job creation could encounter obstacles in coming months. For the moment, employment growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though improving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remains subdued. All in all, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs are an indication of the continuing recovery in France. French growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having slowed from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.1% in 2016 - is set to rebound to 1.5% in 2017. If the new Government can take profit from the accelerating recovery to implement reforms, GDP growth could accelerate towards 1.7% in 2018. Those German numbers show a positive performance this month for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The manufacturing PMI came in at 59.4, up from 58.1 in July and better than the expected 57.7 as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories continued to turn in a strong performance. The services sector index was 53.4, up from 53.1 and better than forecasts of a figure of 53.3. So the composite index came in at 55.7, up from 54.7 in July which was also the figure expected for August. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.6% in the second three months of the year, and is likely to continue to operate at a reasonably strong level. Andrew Harker of IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said the expected the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to grow by 0.5% in the third quarter to September. The euro has moved off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, up 0.1% on the day against the dollar with the pound down 0.17% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0882. But analysts believe this has less to do with Draghi and more to do with the German PMI figures which have been released at much the same time (more on that in a moment). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live link to Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Bloomberg: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of economic stimulus has come under criticism, not least from Germany for its negative effect on savers. Draghi defends the moves as based on solid research: A policy response that has its foundation in rigorous research is less prone to being impaired by political compromise and easier to explain to the general public. ... Keynes is often quoted as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, for policymakers, it is not that simple, and research helps us to decide whether a change in the facts deserves a policy response or, as we say, we should look through it.... When the world changes as it did ten years ago, policies, especially monetary policy, need to be adjusted. Such an adjustment, never easy, requires unprejudiced, honest assessment of the new realities with clear eyes, unencumbered by the defence of previously held paradigms that have lost any explanatory power. He also warns of challenges ahead: We must be aware of the gaps that still remain in our knowledge. Our mainstream macroeconomic models still have little to say, for instance, about the non-linear propagation of shocks, the distributional impacts of policies, or how endogenous firm entry and exit can affect economic performance. Policy actions undertaken in the last ten years in monetary policy and in regulation and supervision have made the world more resilient. But we should continue preparing for new challenges. ECB boss Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has been released, and is a run through of the financial crisis and the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 response to it. Entitled The interdependence of research and policymaking there seem few hints as to the future plans for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme. But Draghi talks about how central banks responded to the financial crisis, and defends QE: Economic research has also evolved in its thinking of how central banks should respond to an emerging crisis, particularly when their standard monetary policy instrument, typically a short-term interest rate, reaches its effective lower bound. At the lower bound, monetary accommodation cannot be provided through further reductions in short-term interest rates and policy must become non-standard. One option is to rely on forward guidance, i.e. to promise to keep interest rates low for longer in the future. Such commitments, if credible, lower longer-term interest rates and provide economic stimulus even if the current interest rate remains unchanged. While forward guidance is a useful instrument, recent research has highlighted that its effectiveness can be improved if combined with other non-standard monetary policies. Research in both academia and in central banks has therefore re-examined alternative monetary policy tools, including so-called quantitative easing (QE) policies. And here the newly developed models with financial frictions have been useful. Earlier studies based on the assumption of frictionless financial markets had concluded that QE is completely ineffective. The renewed focus on financial frictions clarified that this conclusion is unwarranted, once it is recognised that financial intermediaries are subject to leverage constraints. Large-scale asset purchases can ease these constraints and increase investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk-bearing capacity, leading to a portfolio rebalancing towards risky assets and to strengthened lending activity for banks. It is a downbeat opening for European markets, as investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing geopolitical concerns - North Korea, Trump - and ahead of the central bankers meeting at Jackson Hole. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.1%, not helped by the drop in advertising giant WPP. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened down 0.1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.2% lower, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is flat and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has edged up 0.05%. Advertising giant WPP has seen its shares slide in early trading after the group cut its full year net sales target. It dropped as low as \u00c2\u00a313.93, down 12%, before recovering a little to its current \u00c2\u00a314.70, down 8%. Mark Sweney reports: Sir Martin Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WPP is facing its worst year in a decade as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising group was forced to slash growth forecasts for the second time after sales went into reverse in the first half. The company cut its full-year growth forecast for revenues and net sales to between zero and 1% after reporting a marked deterioration in the second quarter that missed City expectations by some distance. Sorrell started the year forecasting that WPP would see growth of 3% but cut this in March to 2% to reflect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tepid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic growth and weak new business trends. On Wednesday, he slashed that even further after reporting that that net sales in the first half fell by 0.5%, compared with analyst consensus expectations of 0.67% growth. The City expected growth in the second quarter of 0.5%, but WPP plummeted by 1.7%. The full story is here: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has beaten forecasts although the services side came in slightly below expectations. The flash manufacturing PMI for August rose from 54.9 to 55.8, better than the forecast of 54.5. This was the fastest pace for more than six years. Services slipped from 56 to 55.5, below the expected 55.8. But overall the composite number was better than expected, steady at 55.6 and marginally higher than the forecast 55.5. However: More on Draghi, with Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities suggesting the ECB president may not be able to avoid giving some hints as to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking on the future of its economic stimulus package: The stakes are high for Mario Draghi during the Jackson Hole Symposium as he is expected to avoid talking about tapering at this point in an attempt to soften the euro but it will be virtually impossible for him to successfully sidestep any questions regarding the matter. A good precursor of what the ECB President will talk about will be his speech in Lindau, Germany today and if he hints on a bearish bias ahead of the weekend meeting in Wyoming then the Euro will drive towards 1.1700. The speech from ECB boss Mario Draghi may indeed be a damp squib, reckon analysts at RBC Capital Markets: This morning, ECB Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak at an event in Lindau, Germany. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website has the Draghi address beginning at 8:25 BST with the text of the address published on the ECB website. As we have argued before when it comes to his Jackson Hole appearance later this week (Friday), we doubt that the ECB president will have anything substantially new to say ahead of the crucial ECB meeting on 7 September. He is more likely to repeat the mantra of patience, persistence and prudence rolled out at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent of Jackson Hole in Sintra, Portugal, earlier this summer. Here are the opening calls for Europe from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get the latest healthcheck of the eurozone economy today, with provisional August manufacturing and services numbers for France and Germany, as well as the bloc as a whole. Analysts expect a slight decline for the two countries, with Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK saying: After a strong few months [Germany does] appear to be starting to show signs of plateauing. Expectations are for a modest decline from 58.1 to 57.7 in manufacturing, while services, which have been underperforming expected to pick up from 53.1 to 53.4. The numbers from France are also expected to decline modestly with manufacturing slipping back to 54.5 from 54.9 and services to come in at 55.9, down from 56.0. The German figure in particular will be under scrutiny after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing economic sentiment figures, which appear to have been partly affected by the continuing emissions scandal at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key car companies. Hewson again: It was only a month ago that the head of the German IFO reported that business confidence had hit record highs in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy with sentiment amongst German businesses at euphoric levels. This in itself should have acted as a warning sign given that euphoria as an emotion tends to dissipate quite quickly and subsequently be followed by either melancholy or depression. This appears to be what German investors are experiencing if yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ZEW economic expectations is any guide, after it hit its lowest level this year, and a 10 month low. The reality is that the truth is likely to be somewhere in between and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest German flash PMI data along with this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO should give some clues as to whether investor concern with respect to German economic expectations is one that is shared by German businesses. The fact is that investor confidence has been declining steadily since May, which is roughly around the same time that the German DAX topped out and started its steady decline to the three month lows we saw last week, and these two do have a tendency to correlate quite closely. It could be that the growing scandal surrounding the German auto sector has the potential to make German businesses a little bit nervous given how many jobs rely on this powerful part of the German economy, which means this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO reading could be quite instructive. Elsewhere European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to make a speech at a meeting on economic sciences in Lindau, Germany. It will be scrutinised for any hints as to when the central bank might beginning withdrawing its economic stimulus package. The euro has been weak recently as uncertainty surrounds the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans, but it seems unlikely Draghi will give much away today, when it has already been suggested he will say little at the key meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in the US later this week. Meanwhile markets are expect to get off to a mixed start, as investors await the Jackson Hole bunfight. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9% on hopes that President Trump would now move to push through tax reforms. But there could be renewed nervousness today after a rally in Phoenix, when Trump returned to his populist tactics including a threat to shut down the federal government unless Congress provided funding for his promised border wall with Mexico. In Asia the Nikkei 225 has moved slightly higher, but the Hong Kong stock exchange has shut after Typhoon Hato came within 60 kilometers of the country. The agenda: 8.00 BST ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Lindau, Germany 8.00 BST French manufacturing, services and composite PMIs 8.30 BST German manufacturing, services and composite PMIs 9.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing, services and composite PMIs",

Shares in Provident had plunged 66% on Tuesday, wiping \u00c2\u00a31.7bn off its stock market value, after it issued a shock profit warning and longstanding chief executive, Peter Crook, resigned. The share price recovered 12% on Wednesday to 661p, still far below Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close of about \u00c2\u00a317.40. The company, which makes short-term loans at high interest rates to people in financial difficulty, blamed new software it uses to arrange home visits by its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer experience managers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (CEMs), who travel the country selling loans and collecting debts. Comments on an internet forum for Provident salespeople, Providentagents.com, suggest that the company faces losing staff to competitors. One forum user, Daisy Boo, said she was aware of several CEMs planning to quit, claiming that there would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loads more leaving\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One CEM, who asked not to be named, showed the Guardian a message from rival a company, Loans At Home, offering him a job. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are going to be jumping ship,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Provident created 2,500 full-time CEM roles earlier this year, doing away with its 130-year old army of self-employed agents who managed their own list of clients and decided their own hours. But the use of new software to manage their schedules has fallen into disarray, with debt collectors complaining they are being sent to the wrong addresses at the wrong time, or to homes already visited by colleagues. One forum user, Bunny, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I feel I am falling behind when all I want to do is work. So frustrating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stuart Duncan, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said Provident was under mounting pressure to fix its technical issues quickly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The likes of [its competitors] Morses Club and Loans at Home are picking up experienced agents and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably fair to say that a lot are coming from Provident,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once they [sales agents] have relationships with customers, they become valuable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Duncan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every competitor will be looking at every agent, thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow many of them can we get?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One former agent told the Guardian that Provident had offered agents a 20% commission if they stayed for three months until it had hired enough CEMs. But he claimed that many left anyway, after Morses Club offered to match any commission they had been making for 12 months, regardless of how they did. One former agent said this was already costing Provident customers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any agent that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left and gone elsewhere will have taken, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagine, 50-100 customers already,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only going to take the good ones.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several of Provident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 800,000 home credit customers told the Guardian they have been badly affected by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Jacqueline Goddard, 62, from Boston, said no Provident employees had come to collect payments for four weeks and she is now in arrears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am on the breadline now, so I cannot afford more payments. The money we used for loan repayments went on other things.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Provident Financial declined to comment.",

But what action will the ECB actually take? Does the ECB even know what to do next? Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the ECB currently looks at the Eurozone, it sees a modest party with people enjoying themselves. The party is far from over but it could probably do with fewer QE drinks served by one of the hosts: Mario Draghi. In fact, serving less would come in handy as the drinks in Mario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fridge are running low. But how to tell the party guests? And how to do it without getting called out as a party pooper?</p> <p>In our view, the main arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. Tapering should be a cautious and very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus, preferably without causing any tightening of financial conditions.</p> <p>Financial market reactions since the Sintra speech in June suggest that Mario Draghi and the ECB have lost some of their golden touch when it comes to guiding expectations. This has been partly driven by the fact that the ECB itself does not seem to be fully convinced what to do next and also by regularly changing its main messages.</p> <p>In our view, it seems most likely that the ECB would reduce the monthly purchases to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn in January, with an open end to the programme but at least until June 2018 and probably increasing the issuer limit and broadening maturities to grant itself maximum flexibility to scale back up once conditions warrant such a move.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599ffdc8e4b009691a5a952e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-25T10:42:36.177Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Financial Times interview with Gary Cohn, head of the White House economic council, also contains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0169006e-8946-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787\">positive news for those hoping for tax reforms</a>.</p> <p>President Trump has been singularly unsuccessful so far in pushing through much of his agenda, and markets have almost given up on expected the long promised reforms. But Cohn said Trump will launch a major push on tax reform next week with a speech in Missouri.</p> <p>And this has helped the US market perk up. Connor Campbell<strong>, f</strong>inancial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [US] index has already had a bit of good news this Friday. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisor has stated in an interview with the Financial Times that felt duty bound to stay on as part of the administration despite the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, putting to bed rumours of his departure.</p> <p>Cohn went further, claiming that Trump will put tax reform back on the agenda next week with a speech in Missouri \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no doubt a relief for investors desperate for a sign that the President will deliver on his market-lifting promises.

Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Jackson Hole Symposium is widely regarded as one of the most notable annual events, not only because of the speakers it attracts but also because it has been used as a platform to warn of upcoming policy announcements. In the past it has been Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke - that have delivered such warnings, the question today is whether she will do the same.</p> <p>The final months of the year are going to be very interesting as far as the Fed and the ECB are concerned which makes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearances from Fed Chair Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi all the more interesting. Both central banks have started the process of tightening monetary policy, although the ECB would probably claim it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a case of removing accommodation. Either way, with the process underway, investors are keen to know what they plan next.</p> <p>The Fed is already well underway with its rate hikes, having started almost two years ago and having raised three more times since (so four in total). With inflation still lagging well below target though, there is growing unease within the central bank about whether the current pace is appropriate. Investors have long been unsure that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be another rate hike this year and the message seems to finally be filtering through to the Fed. It will be interesting to see whether Yellen will address this today or instead focus on balance sheet reduction, which is expected to be announced in September and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interest investors in the same way.</p> <p>The ECB is taking a far more cautious approach having dealt with a far more severe crisis for the last decade, one that the region is only just starting to truly recover from. The central bank announced one reduction on asset purchases last December and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to announce another in the coming months. While investors are desperate to get more information on this, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely given the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unease at past market reactions. I think the central bank will prefer to address this after the meeting next month on home turf and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk further tightening of financial conditions in the meantime, with the euro having already sharply appreciated this year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599ff4a2e4b0d26e26a9f45b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-25T10:10:39.137Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cohn felt &quot;enormous pressure&quot; to quit White House</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over to the US, and there had been some concerns in recent days that Gary Cohn, the head of the White House national economic council, might step down in the wake of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments over the violence at Charlottesville. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/18/markets-slide-on-trump-and-terror-concerns-business-live?page=with:block-5996ce4ce4b01c8820dfc45d#block-5996ce4ce4b01c8820dfc45d\">Markets certainly did not like the idea</a>, given his crucial role and the number of executives who had already quit various government councils.</p> <p>Now in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b85beea2-8924-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787\">an interview with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3)</a> Cohn said he had come under enormous pressure to resign but felt duty bound to carry on.

In recent days it has been flirting with eight year lows against the single currency, with some talk of it falling to parity. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, thinks this is unlikely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has been an easy target for currency markets as the combination of a post-Brexit economic reality check and ongoing political anxiety has made the UK economy an outlier relative to its faster growing European peers. We believe this economic divergence story has largely run its course. In fact, the pound is beginning to show signs of idiosyncratic selling, similar to previous periods when domestic political risks have flared up.</p> <p>We make two points here. First, this tends to be a short-run phenomenon, with the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s material undervaluation acting as a limiting factor for sustained weakness. Second, and more importantly, we would need to see an additional layer of bad news to fuel any further politically-induced GBP selling. This seems unlikely in the absence of a Brexit disaster situation unfolding - that is a complete breakdown in UK-EU negotiations and renewed cliff-edge risks. Political will from both sides suggests the worst-case scenario will be avoided.</p> <p>So while EUR/GBP has overshot our 0.90 forecast for the third quarter of 2017 - and admittedly quicker than we had anticipated - we cite four reasons for why we think a move towards parity looks unlikely at this stage. Our revised forecasts acknowledge the pound could remain under pressure ahead of key domestic and Brexit political risk events in October. But we view this as an overshoot of more fundamentally-justified levels, rather than a sustained trend in EUR/GBP towards parity.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd4abbd492713afbc58c122f8c08572455138b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd4abbd492713afbc58c122f8c08572455138b8/129_0_2942_1765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"euro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The four reasons are:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong> The euro has become a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for currency markets</strong></p> <p>We had earmarked October as being a pivotal month for the pound regarding political risk events. The Tory Party Conference (1-4 October), the final round of opening Brexit talks (9 October) and EU summit (19-20 October) will give markets an opportunity to assess the progress made when it comes to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. These event risks mean that it is understandable to see the pound markets trading with some apprehension. We have been warning of a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell on (PM) May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 type of behaviour emerging ahead of October. </p> <p>However, the extent of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent weakness - and deviation from short-term fundamentals - is now starting to look excessive relative to the near-term political risks at stake. This is certainly the case for EUR/GBP, which based on our estimates is trading around 4% above its short-term financial fair value. In contrast, GBP/USD is showing no visible signs of a UK-specific risk premium. We rationalise this as both UK and US political uncertainty offsetting each other in the near-term, making the euro the go-to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in currency markets. How times have changed.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Political will suggests a Brexit disaster can be avoided</strong></p> <p>For the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politically-driven weakness to persist and extend all the way towards parity against the euro, we would argue that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risks would need to notch up another gear. In reality, the only way this could occur over the next six months is if we get a nightmare Brexit scenario in October - that is a complete breakdown of UK-EU negotiations.</p> <p>Instead, while we have previously acknowledged it is too early for the pound markets to price in any Brexit transitional deal hopes, we do think the growing consensus within Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet over a transitional arrangement means that the tail risks of a cliff-edge Brexit are diminishing. The lack of clarity by the UK government on any preferred transition length - and rumours of only a 12 or 18-month arrangement being sought - may be seen as a near-term disappointment.</p> <p>Progress on securing a transition deal - with both sides providing strong assurances - should help to ease any significant pound downside bias. However, for this to serve as a catalyst for a rebound in the currency, we would need to see evidence that a reduction in economic uncertainty is in fact spurring a rebound in investment activity. This is what would give the Bank of England (BoE) greater confidence to begin normalising monetary policy - which would undoubtedly be a positive pound development.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>The pound is cheap, very cheap</strong></p> <p>We see the pound as extremely undervalued, with the very stretched valuation likely putting a limit on the scale of further downside. EUR/GBP is rich by a staggering 20% based on our medium-term Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate valuation framework. Even if we control for the post 2015 rise in pound fair value due to improving UK terms of trade and declining UK government consumption, EUR/GBP would still be overvalued by 14%. When the medium-term valuation reaches such extreme levels, it tends to be difficult for the currency to weaken materially given the limits imposed by the underlying fundamentals.</p> <p><strong>Markets have adjusted to a wait-and-see Bank of England stance</strong></p> <p>The latest round of key UK economic data has put talks of a Bank of England rate hike on the back burner, with the breakdown of second quarter GDP highlighting the current weakness of the UK consumer. However, markets have now adjusted to a wait-and-see BoE policy stance and see limited risks of a flatter UK rate curve. For short-term domestic rates to move lower, we would need to see evidence of weak consumer activity turning into a hard-landing for the UK economy. Our economists see this as highly unlikely and are not expecting the economy to take a significant turn for the worst.</p> <p>We also believe EUR/GBP parity may not be in the economic interests of the BoE given the implications that further pound weakness has for imported inflation and the squeeze in real household incomes story. Equally, one could argue it is not in the economic interests of the ECB for financial markets to get ahead of themselves when it comes to pricing in the end of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme. With implicit opposition from both sides, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to fundamentally justify any EUR/GBP move towards parity - certainly over the next three to six months.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Patel admits ING could be wrong about not hitting parity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apart from one (or more) of our four assumptions turning out to be wrong, currency markets can sometimes be an untamed beast. Just because the pound is undervalued doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it should rally. There needs to be some positive catalysts for the pound to manifest, not least signs of a stabilisation in a slowing UK economy and greater progress towards a Brexit transition deal (even if not fully agreed). But certainly, the very negative psychology needs to be broken, such that the pound is not such a clear sell on rallies. Indeed we \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the BoE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are on the look-out for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality developing, where the pound, gilts and equities all sell-off at the same time. This, however, has not been the case so far.</p> <p>If that mood was to develop, with pound weakness proving more trouble for the inflation trajectory, the IMF might recommend sharp rate hikes to break the vicious cycle. Typically that has been the prescription for significant 20% falls for the likes of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Of course, the UK has had some painful experiences in using rate hikes to defend the pound (think 1992), and we very much doubt that the BoE would do that to support the currency. Yet, we believe, the bearish psychology on the pound still needs to be broken.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599fcdd0e4b0d26e26a9f3d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-25T07:18:57.557Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil climbs as Hurricane Harvey approaches Texas</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are climbing as Hurricane Harvey, potentially the biggest to hit the US in more than a decade, approaches Texas.</p> <p>Brent crude is up nearly 1% at $52.55 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.8% higher at \u00c2\u00a247.83.on concerns about the disruption the storm could cause.

But in the US, durable goods orders slumped in July. Meanwhile, the head of the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national economic council, Gary Cohn, has told the Financial Times he came under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to quit his post after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Charlottesville comments but felt duty bound to carry on. He also suggested Trump would move forward with tax reforms next week. And with Hurricane Harvey heading for Texas, oil prices have moved higher on fears of disruption to production. On the markets the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3% , Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.2% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.13%. The pound is currently up 0.23% at $1.1.2828 and 0.13% better at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0864. With the recent pressure on the pound, there has been some talk it could reach parity with the euro, but ING thinks this is unlikely. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Keep an eye on the Business site for reports from Jackson Hole. Meanwhile, thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Commenting on the durable goods numbers, Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: The ever-volatile durable goods report delivered once again today, with figures showing a 6.8% decline in orders for July. Investors will be concerned on the back of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. Not only will support for the dollar dampen, the downbeat numbers will cast further shadows over the US growth outlook. US orders for durable goods - long lasting items such as cars and washing machines - fell by more than expected last month. They fell by 6.8% compared to a 6.4% rise in June and expectations of a 6% decline, according to the US Census Bureau. The fall is the biggest since 2014. All eyes may be on ECB president Mario Draghi and whatever comments he may or may not make at Jackson Hole about tapering its bond buying programme or the strength of the euro. But what action will the ECB actually take? Does the ECB even know what to do next? Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING says: When the ECB currently looks at the Eurozone, it sees a modest party with people enjoying themselves. The party is far from over but it could probably do with fewer QE drinks served by one of the hosts: Mario Draghi. In fact, serving less would come in handy as the drinks in Mario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fridge are running low. But how to tell the party guests? And how to do it without getting called out as a party pooper? In our view, the main arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. Tapering should be a cautious and very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus, preferably without causing any tightening of financial conditions. Financial market reactions since the Sintra speech in June suggest that Mario Draghi and the ECB have lost some of their golden touch when it comes to guiding expectations. This has been partly driven by the fact that the ECB itself does not seem to be fully convinced what to do next and also by regularly changing its main messages. In our view, it seems most likely that the ECB would reduce the monthly purchases to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn in January, with an open end to the programme but at least until June 2018 and probably increasing the issuer limit and broadening maturities to grant itself maximum flexibility to scale back up once conditions warrant such a move. The Financial Times interview with Gary Cohn, head of the White House economic council, also contains positive news for those hoping for tax reforms. President Trump has been singularly unsuccessful so far in pushing through much of his agenda, and markets have almost given up on expected the long promised reforms. But Cohn said Trump will launch a major push on tax reform next week with a speech in Missouri. And this has helped the US market perk up. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The [US] index has already had a bit of good news this Friday. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisor has stated in an interview with the Financial Times that felt duty bound to stay on as part of the administration despite the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, putting to bed rumours of his departure. Cohn went further, claiming that Trump will put tax reform back on the agenda next week with a speech in Missouri \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no doubt a relief for investors desperate for a sign that the President will deliver on his market-lifting promises. Whether he can push through said reforms, however, is another matter entirely. In tandem with the European markets, Wall Street is expected to open marginally higher ahead of the Jackson Hole shindig. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to climb around 23 points or around 0.1% in early trading, while most European markets are currently around 0.3% higher. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Jackson Hole Symposium is widely regarded as one of the most notable annual events, not only because of the speakers it attracts but also because it has been used as a platform to warn of upcoming policy announcements. In the past it has been Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke - that have delivered such warnings, the question today is whether she will do the same. The final months of the year are going to be very interesting as far as the Fed and the ECB are concerned which makes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearances from Fed Chair Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi all the more interesting. Both central banks have started the process of tightening monetary policy, although the ECB would probably claim it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a case of removing accommodation. Either way, with the process underway, investors are keen to know what they plan next. The Fed is already well underway with its rate hikes, having started almost two years ago and having raised three more times since (so four in total). With inflation still lagging well below target though, there is growing unease within the central bank about whether the current pace is appropriate. Investors have long been unsure that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be another rate hike this year and the message seems to finally be filtering through to the Fed. It will be interesting to see whether Yellen will address this today or instead focus on balance sheet reduction, which is expected to be announced in September and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interest investors in the same way. The ECB is taking a far more cautious approach having dealt with a far more severe crisis for the last decade, one that the region is only just starting to truly recover from. The central bank announced one reduction on asset purchases last December and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to announce another in the coming months. While investors are desperate to get more information on this, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely given the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unease at past market reactions. I think the central bank will prefer to address this after the meeting next month on home turf and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk further tightening of financial conditions in the meantime, with the euro having already sharply appreciated this year. Over to the US, and there had been some concerns in recent days that Gary Cohn, the head of the White House national economic council, might step down in the wake of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments over the violence at Charlottesville. Markets certainly did not like the idea, given his crucial role and the number of executives who had already quit various government councils. Now in an interview with the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) Cohn said he had come under enormous pressure to resign but felt duty bound to carry on. But he said the current administration had to do more to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He told the FT: This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities... As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJews will not replace us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to cause this Jew to leave his job. I feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. We must all unite together against them. Markets are holding onto their gains, but investors are reluctant to commit themselves ahead of the key Jackson Hole speeches. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Indecision is rife across financial markets this morning, as the impending appearances from Mario Draghi and Janet Yellen mean that there remains little certainty over how this week is likely to close out. For the most part we are likely to hear Draghi reiterate his stance from earlier in the week, with ECB sources recently speculating that Draghi wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t announce any new policy shifts at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. However, we could see Janet Yellen steal the headlines, with today marking her final Jackson Hole appearance before Donald Trump decides her future in February. But there is more activity in the oil market. Mahony said: Hurricane Harvey is bearing down upon the Gulf coast, with traders moving into crude oil given the potential for a massive disruption to a region which accounts for 45% of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refining capacity and 17% of US output. With possibly the biggest storm in over a decade to hit American soil heading straight into the oil producing heartlands, there is the potential for huge disruption both at sea and inland. With three refineries already shutting down ahead of the storm, there is a significant chance that we will see a major disruption to the extraction and refining of crude oil and gasoline irrespective of any physical damage. The continuing strength of the German economy, as shown earlier by the GDP figures, has been reinforced by the latest business survey. Despite slipping slightly after six consecutive rises, the Ifo business climate index at 115.9 still met expectations. Clemens Fuest, resident of the ifo Institute, said: The ifo Business Climate Index edged downwards from 116.0 points last month to 115.9 points in August. But sentiment among German businesses remains very strong. The decline was due to slightly less positive assessments of the current business situation. Companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 short-term business outlook, by contrast, improved. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains on track for growth. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said there was no signs of weakness in the German economy despite the dip in the Ifo index: The Ifo index dropped only marginally in August, confirming the almost breathtaking strength of the German economy. After six consecutive increases and three all-time highs in a row, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, just dropped for the first time. The drop, however, was only marginal and the Ifo now stands at 115.9, from 116.0 in July. Interestingly, the decrease was exclusively driven by the current assessment component. Expectations increased to 107.9, from 107.3 in July. It is almost pointless searching for macro-economic explanations for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small drop. Of course, next to acrophobia, reasons for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop could be the strengthening of the euro over the last few months, fresh geopolitical concerns with the US-North Korean conflict and fading signs of any imminent investment boom in the US. However, the best explanation for the drop is simply a small technical correction after three record-highs in a row. All of this means that, unless German businesses are living in a kind of never-never land, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ifo index sends a clear signal that the German economy is powering ahead. What might look boring from the outside is clearly enjoyable from the inside. Jackson Hole is unlikely to provide much cause for market volatility, reckons the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Its European head of global markets research, Derek Halpenny, said: We see little reason for President Draghi choosing the Jackson Hole platform for a further update on the monetary policy outlook, but a comment on euro appreciation is more likely. The danger of Draghi not saying much of any substance today is that the markets will take it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreen light\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for further euro buying. Although, with the ECB policy meeting not far from now we doubt the euro will advance much over the near-term. Of greater importance today is the speech by Fed Chair Yellen, as the probability of a funds rate hike in December has dropped to around 30% despite the economy running at a 1.9% growth rate in the first half of the year and now showing signs of a modest pick-up. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is on financial market stability and given the reference to asset valuations in the minutes from the July meeting, which Fed Staff concluded had increased from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notable to elevated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Chair Yellen may expand on this. Yellen may believe the markets need reminding that the Fed remains on course to raise the federal funds rate one further time this year. This would merely be a repeat of current Fed communication and hence is unlikely to prompt any major lift for the US dollar. The pound is holding fairly steady after a downbeat week dominated by Brexit worries, edging lower against the dollar but marginally higher against the euro. It is currently at \u00c2\u00a21.2798, down 0.01%, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0860, up 0.09%. In recent days it has been flirting with eight year lows against the single currency, with some talk of it falling to parity. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, thinks this is unlikely: The pound has been an easy target for currency markets as the combination of a post-Brexit economic reality check and ongoing political anxiety has made the UK economy an outlier relative to its faster growing European peers. We believe this economic divergence story has largely run its course. In fact, the pound is beginning to show signs of idiosyncratic selling, similar to previous periods when domestic political risks have flared up. We make two points here. First, this tends to be a short-run phenomenon, with the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s material undervaluation acting as a limiting factor for sustained weakness. Second, and more importantly, we would need to see an additional layer of bad news to fuel any further politically-induced GBP selling. This seems unlikely in the absence of a Brexit disaster situation unfolding - that is a complete breakdown in UK-EU negotiations and renewed cliff-edge risks. Political will from both sides suggests the worst-case scenario will be avoided. So while EUR/GBP has overshot our 0.90 forecast for the third quarter of 2017 - and admittedly quicker than we had anticipated - we cite four reasons for why we think a move towards parity looks unlikely at this stage. Our revised forecasts acknowledge the pound could remain under pressure ahead of key domestic and Brexit political risk events in October. But we view this as an overshoot of more fundamentally-justified levels, rather than a sustained trend in EUR/GBP towards parity. The four reasons are: The euro has become a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for currency markets We had earmarked October as being a pivotal month for the pound regarding political risk events. The Tory Party Conference (1-4 October), the final round of opening Brexit talks (9 October) and EU summit (19-20 October) will give markets an opportunity to assess the progress made when it comes to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. These event risks mean that it is understandable to see the pound markets trading with some apprehension. We have been warning of a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell on (PM) May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 type of behaviour emerging ahead of October. However, the extent of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent weakness - and deviation from short-term fundamentals - is now starting to look excessive relative to the near-term political risks at stake. This is certainly the case for EUR/GBP, which based on our estimates is trading around 4% above its short-term financial fair value. In contrast, GBP/USD is showing no visible signs of a UK-specific risk premium. We rationalise this as both UK and US political uncertainty offsetting each other in the near-term, making the euro the go-to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in currency markets. How times have changed. Political will suggests a Brexit disaster can be avoided For the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politically-driven weakness to persist and extend all the way towards parity against the euro, we would argue that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risks would need to notch up another gear. In reality, the only way this could occur over the next six months is if we get a nightmare Brexit scenario in October - that is a complete breakdown of UK-EU negotiations. Instead, while we have previously acknowledged it is too early for the pound markets to price in any Brexit transitional deal hopes, we do think the growing consensus within Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet over a transitional arrangement means that the tail risks of a cliff-edge Brexit are diminishing. The lack of clarity by the UK government on any preferred transition length - and rumours of only a 12 or 18-month arrangement being sought - may be seen as a near-term disappointment. Progress on securing a transition deal - with both sides providing strong assurances - should help to ease any significant pound downside bias. However, for this to serve as a catalyst for a rebound in the currency, we would need to see evidence that a reduction in economic uncertainty is in fact spurring a rebound in investment activity. This is what would give the Bank of England (BoE) greater confidence to begin normalising monetary policy - which would undoubtedly be a positive pound development. The pound is cheap, very cheap We see the pound as extremely undervalued, with the very stretched valuation likely putting a limit on the scale of further downside. EUR/GBP is rich by a staggering 20% based on our medium-term Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate valuation framework. Even if we control for the post 2015 rise in pound fair value due to improving UK terms of trade and declining UK government consumption, EUR/GBP would still be overvalued by 14%. When the medium-term valuation reaches such extreme levels, it tends to be difficult for the currency to weaken materially given the limits imposed by the underlying fundamentals. Markets have adjusted to a wait-and-see Bank of England stance The latest round of key UK economic data has put talks of a Bank of England rate hike on the back burner, with the breakdown of second quarter GDP highlighting the current weakness of the UK consumer. However, markets have now adjusted to a wait-and-see BoE policy stance and see limited risks of a flatter UK rate curve. For short-term domestic rates to move lower, we would need to see evidence of weak consumer activity turning into a hard-landing for the UK economy. Our economists see this as highly unlikely and are not expecting the economy to take a significant turn for the worst. We also believe EUR/GBP parity may not be in the economic interests of the BoE given the implications that further pound weakness has for imported inflation and the squeeze in real household incomes story. Equally, one could argue it is not in the economic interests of the ECB for financial markets to get ahead of themselves when it comes to pricing in the end of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme. With implicit opposition from both sides, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to fundamentally justify any EUR/GBP move towards parity - certainly over the next three to six months. But Patel admits ING could be wrong about not hitting parity: Apart from one (or more) of our four assumptions turning out to be wrong, currency markets can sometimes be an untamed beast. Just because the pound is undervalued doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it should rally. There needs to be some positive catalysts for the pound to manifest, not least signs of a stabilisation in a slowing UK economy and greater progress towards a Brexit transition deal (even if not fully agreed). But certainly, the very negative psychology needs to be broken, such that the pound is not such a clear sell on rallies. Indeed we \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the BoE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are on the look-out for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality developing, where the pound, gilts and equities all sell-off at the same time. This, however, has not been the case so far. If that mood was to develop, with pound weakness proving more trouble for the inflation trajectory, the IMF might recommend sharp rate hikes to break the vicious cycle. Typically that has been the prescription for significant 20% falls for the likes of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Of course, the UK has had some painful experiences in using rate hikes to defend the pound (think 1992), and we very much doubt that the BoE would do that to support the currency. Yet, we believe, the bearish psychology on the pound still needs to be broken. Oil prices are climbing as Hurricane Harvey, potentially the biggest to hit the US in more than a decade, approaches Texas. Brent crude is up nearly 1% at $52.55 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.8% higher at \u00c2\u00a247.83.on concerns about the disruption the storm could cause. Justin Chan at Numis said: Hurricane Harvey, a category-three storm, is expected to make landfall Friday night along the central coast of Texas where many refineries are located. The hurricane has continued to strengthen; if Harvey remains a category-three storm on landfall, it will be the strongest to hit the US since 2005. Energy companies have already shut coastal refineries and removed workers from offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Reuters reports, adding that nearly 10% of offshore Gulf crude output capacity had been halted by Thursday. Ahead of the main speeches at Jackson Hole, European stock markets have made a positive start to the day. The FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.11%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.15% while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 0.2% better. There could be some fluctuations as the day progresses but some analysts believe investors will prefer to keep their powder dry. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaping up to be an uneventful trading session, at least until we get past speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi later this evening. Investors have used the Jackson Hole event as an excuse to go on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite numerous hints from various insiders that neither Yellen nor Draghi will say anything dramatic when it comes to monetary policy. This is especially true of the Federal Reserve chair... In other words, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s symposium should see a return to the days when it was a dry and dusty academic event only of interest to economists. But even though Mr Draghi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to address the issue of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion per month bond purchase programme, some traders believe he may have something to say about the euro. This follows on from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release of minutes from the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting which showed that the Governing Council were concerned about the current strength of the euro. Some traders feel that the ECB don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see the EURUSD get much above 1.2000 and will be listening out for anything that Mr Draghi may say on this matter. A revised second quarter growth figure for the German economy was in line with the initial estimates. The country - the economic powerhouse of the eurozone - saw GDP grow by 0.6% quarter on quarter and 0.8% year on year. Later comes the IFO business confidence index. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate edged up by more than expected in August. The consumer price index rose from 0.1% in July to 0.5% year on year, compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Improved inflation is good news for the Bank of Japan, even though the Japanese economy is still very far from the 2% inflation goal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be looking to the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US for clues to the future of their various quantitative easing and bond buying programmes. In particular speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be scoured for clues on policy. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After a long wait the Jackson Hole symposium finally kicked off yesterday, and traders will be paying close attention to the speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, which are due to take place today... We were told by unnamed sources from the European Central Bank (ECB),that Mr Draghi will not be laying down the groundwork for the tapering of the stimulus package. The ECB chief will probably use the speech to congratulate himself on the recovery of the eurozone thanks to the loose monetary policy, but he might use the relatively low inflation rate as an excuse not to talk about reigning in the stimulus package. The ECB are buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion worth of government bonds per month, and traders know full well the central bank will run out of bonds to buy. The ECB will have to come up with alternative ways to keep the policy loose, because a weak euro will assist the eurozone. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is likely give us more of the usual, that the US economy is improving, and in particular unemployment is falling. Earnings could be firmer but they are edging higher. The US inflation level is below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, and if Ms Yellen brings that up, it will tip off traders that we are unlikely to see a rate hike in December. Ahead of the speeches, markets look fairly calm. The Nikkei 225 is up 0.5% and the Hang Seng has added 1%. European markets are forecast to open slightly higher: On the foreign exchanges, the pound is holding steady against both the euro and the dollar. We have already had Japanese inflation - slightly higher than expected - and German GDP - in line with forecasts (more on those shortly). Otherwise the Jackson Hole meeting dominates the day.

Julia Kollewe reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>With the catastrophic Texas floods triggered by Hurricane Harvey set to worsen, early estimates suggest the financial damage it has inflicted has already run into tens of billions of dollars, and one forecaster has predicted the final bill could be as high as $100bn (\u00c2\u00a377bn).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/28/ex-hurricane-harvey-houston-flooded-as-catastrophe-unfolds-in-texas-latest-updates\">The tropical storm continues to batter south-eastern Texas</a>, where it has so far claimed at least nine lives, and is expected to reach southern Louisiana. Thousands of homes have been flooded forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. US authorities estimate 30,000 people will need shelter.</p> <p>So far predictions of the final cost of the damage vary widely. Some insurance analysts are putting the likely damage at $30 to $50bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but point out that not all of this sum will be covered by insurance.

North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic escalation last night prompted some impressive risk-off moves in Asia, with the European session naturally following suit. US futures are under pressure, although everyone is waiting for the first tweet on the subject from the Commander-in-Chief before hitting the sell button too hard.

We have a few weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, when the bank will get the chance to put a more dollar-positive view forward.

ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro continues to march higher despite ECB President Mario Draghi staying tight-lipped over future policy plans at Jackson Hole (as we expected). The focus now turns to the crucial 7 September ECB meeting: out economists note that the demand for an ECB game plan on tapering is getting stronger by the day; indeed the key arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. However, we note that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference will be for a cautious tapering, with a very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus that ideally doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause any tightening of financial conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>If the pound is weak against the euro, then it is a different story regarding the dollar.</p> <p>The US currency has been under pressure on concerns about the continuing uncertainty in the White House, while Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gave it little support in her own speech at Jackson Hole.

However, most of the gains in the precious metal occurred before the missile launch, meaning that there are different factors supporting prices. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields have been falling since 10 July, with total declines of 10.8%. This partially explains gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 8.6% surge since then, and investors are still not buying Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. Yields should be much higher than current levels, especially since the Fed didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to back off on raising rates.</p> <p>Gary Cohn, head of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Economic Council, has a high probability of replacing Janet Yellen when her term ends by January 2018. Cohn is not only expected to back financial sector deregulation, but also to keep interest rates low in order to support the implementation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-growth economic policies. This provides another valid reason to purchase the yellow metal. With ongoing geopolitical tensions, the looming debt ceiling, threats to scrap Nafta, and a low yield environment, gold prices are likely to remain well supported. $1,300 has been a critical resistance level since the beginning of the year, with four failing attempts to break through; after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge however, $1,300 will likely turn into support. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-29T08:01:05.959Z\">at 9.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59a5161ae4b01cebc9e1847a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/juliakollewe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-29T07:24:14.011Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77d3a38149a63193e0925b42207b61302b893b6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77d3a38149a63193e0925b42207b61302b893b6b/0_265_5418_3252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terraced houses in Notting Hill, west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terraced houses in Notting Hill, west London.

                "bodyText":"News that North Korea had launched a missile over Japan unnerved investors and sent them scurrying out of shares and into safer assets. Just when some of the belligerence and rhetoric between North Korea and the US seemed to have faded, this latest action ratcheted up the tensions again. President Trump announced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all options are on the table\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following the missile launch. So European markets fell back with the FTSE 100 hitting a 16 week low and the European Stoxx 600 at a six month low. The Vix volatility index moved sharply higher, reflecting the uncertainty among traders. Gold was in demand as investors sought havens for their cash, as were Swiss francs and the yen. On the currency markets it was a mixed day for the pound. It fell against the euro, both on Brexit worries and thanks to the continuing strength of the euro itself. But Capital Economics believes the current weakness of the pound against the single currency may not last. Against the dollar the pound moved higher, benefiting from the US currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness on talk another interest rate rise may not be imminent. There were also concerns about the effect of tropical storm Harvey on the US economy. Harvey, formerly designated a hurricane, has seen oil prices slip on uncertainty over the damage it is causing to refineries. On the economic front, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP grew by 0.5% in the second quarter as expected, while German consumer confidence edged higher. In the UK there were some weak housing market figures. At the moment the FTSE 100 has lost just over 1%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.9%. and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 1.37%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.47%. Gold is up $5 an ounce at $1322, while Brent crude is own 0.15% at $51.81 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In common with the European markets, Wall Street has dropped sharply in the wake of the renewed tensions following North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch of a missile over Japan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 127 points or 0.58% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.64% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.84%. More house price data from the US, and it is pretty much in line with expectations: US stock markets look set to open lower when the bells ring in New York this morning. Both the S&amp;P and Dow futures are down ahead of the business day, driven down by fears over North Korea. Economists seem unfazed by the likely impact of Hurricane Harvey, even though gas prices are rising and the region supplies 20% of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total crude oil supply. The US has bounced back quickly from similar disasters and investors are clearly betting the same will be true this time. Pyongyang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest moves, however, are another story. Harvey may no longer be a hurricane but a tropical storm, but it is likely to be causing considerable financial damage. Julia Kollewe reports: With the catastrophic Texas floods triggered by Hurricane Harvey set to worsen, early estimates suggest the financial damage it has inflicted has already run into tens of billions of dollars, and one forecaster has predicted the final bill could be as high as $100bn (\u00c2\u00a377bn). The tropical storm continues to batter south-eastern Texas, where it has so far claimed at least nine lives, and is expected to reach southern Louisiana. Thousands of homes have been flooded forcing residents to seek emergency shelter. US authorities estimate 30,000 people will need shelter. So far predictions of the final cost of the damage vary widely. Some insurance analysts are putting the likely damage at $30 to $50bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but point out that not all of this sum will be covered by insurance. However, David Havens, an insurance analyst at Imperial Capital in New York, told Bloomberg News the final bill could reach as much as $100bn. This compares with damage of $120bn caused by hurricane Katrina in 2005, which included $80bn of insured losses, and the $75bn economic losses caused by hurricane Sandy in 2012. As homeowners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 personal insurance policies tend to exclude flood cover, most of the flood-related claims will be borne by the US National Flood Insurance Programme. However, many people in eastern Texas have failed to buy coverage from NFIP or have let their policies lapse, the New York Times reported. It said many never had to buy flood insurance because their property was not listed as being on a 100-year floodplain. Charles Watson of data analytics firm Enki estimates the damage to homes alone could total $30bn. The full story is here: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current weakness against the euro may not last, says Capital Economics: The White House has issued a response to the North Korea missile launch: Back with Germany, and consumer confidence continues to grow. Released earlier, the GfK consumer consumer confidence survey came in at 10.9, its highest level since October 2001 and up from 10.8 the previous month. Analysts had expected an unchanged reading. GFK said: Consumers in Germany see the domestic economy continuing on a very good path. Evidence of this is provided by the new increases in income expectation and propensity to buy. It has been possible for both to again improve in their high levels. Economic expectation, on the other hand, has suffered a setback. Yet its current level still suggests that consumers nevertheless see the German economy continuing on a course for growth. Oil prices have slipped back, on uncertainty over the damage being caused in Texas by Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm. Brent crude is down 0.79% at $51.48 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.09% lower at $46.53. The move in Brent in particular is putting more pressure on markets which are already suffering from the renewed tensions after North Korea launched its missile over Japan. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provocative missile launch over Japan remained the main market-driver this Tuesday, with the European indices only widening their losses as the morning went on. There were a variety of different reasons, on top of the macro-fears surrounding Kim Jong Un\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s itchy trigger figure, driving the European markets lower. In the UK the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving it only handful of points above 7300 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was exacerbated by Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own 1% drop, taking the black stuff back below $51.50 per barrel. The commodity is being dragged lower by news that Hurricane Harvey hit several refineries along the US Gulf Coast, and has in turn weighed on the likes of BP and Shell. The DAX and CAC saw their losses increase to 1.9% and 1.5% respectively as the euro went on its latest romp. Against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has myriad problems to deal with both internationally and domestically \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the euro surged half a percent to a $1.205-nearing 2 and a half year high, while against the pound it rose 0.4% to send sterling stumbling towards \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.075. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forthcoming federal elections will have little impact on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating over the next four years whatever the outcome, according to a report from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Colin Ellis, a managing director at the ratings agency and co-author of the study, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although the German elections could result in a number of different potential coalitions, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any plausible combination to have a material impact on the credit profiles of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rated debt issuers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report stated: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit quality is resilient to any plausible election outcome given the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very high economic, institutional and fiscal strength. However, growth and debt levels will be influenced by policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 response to rising demographic pressures and their approach to labour market flexibility. At the European level, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on issues such as debt pooling or fiscal transfers among European Union countries will be an important factor. Given the main parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 differing views on these and other important policy areas, the composition of the next coalition will, at the margins at least, influence how Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit profile evolves. As the market slide accelerates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the FTSE 100 is down 1.36%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has lost 1.96% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 1.58% lower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the so-called fear index is on the rise. The Vix volatility index has jumped 25% to 14.16 since the North Korea missile launch, though this is below the year high of 17.28 on 11 August after President Trump made his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comments against Kim Jong-un. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After weeks of quiet, renewed geopolitical tensions and a soaring euro are combining to cause some impressive moves across markets this morning. We have seen triple-digit losses on the FTSE 100, while in Europe the surge in the euro past $1.20 has resulted in brutal morning for European equities. North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic escalation last night prompted some impressive risk-off moves in Asia, with the European session naturally following suit. US futures are under pressure, although everyone is waiting for the first tweet on the subject from the Commander-in-Chief before hitting the sell button too hard. Hurricane Harvey is hitting insurers hard, as investors try to price in the potential costs of the devastation in Texas, while a drop in US Treasury yields is prompting a mini-rout in bank stocks. Much of what we are seeing in equities this morning is also a reflection of the moves in the foreign exchange space; Jackson Hole duly delivered in terms of lack of news, and the reflex action has kicked in, with investors buying the euro, driving it to a 3-year high, and resuming their selling of the US dollar. We have a few weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, when the bank will get the chance to put a more dollar-positive view forward. Until then, we should expect further euro strength, and thus more downside for European stock markets. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow to start at 21,666, 142 points lower from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Self explanatory: Sterling is having a tough day against the single currency, thanks to continuing concerns about the outcome of Brexit talks as well as the strength of the euro. The pound is currently down 0.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0751. Investors are nervous about the lack of progress in the Brexit discussions and an uninspiring performance from the UK economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it showed the slowest growth of any G7 country in the second quarter. Former MPC member Andrew Sentance tweeted: However the strength of the euro is also a factor. ECB president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers at the end of last week revealed nothing much about future monetary policy; but that did little to dispel the idea the central bank would soon set out plans to cut back its economic stimulus measures, including easing its bond-buying programme. ING Bank said: The euro continues to march higher despite ECB President Mario Draghi staying tight-lipped over future policy plans at Jackson Hole (as we expected). The focus now turns to the crucial 7 September ECB meeting: out economists note that the demand for an ECB game plan on tapering is getting stronger by the day; indeed the key arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. However, we note that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference will be for a cautious tapering, with a very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus that ideally doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause any tightening of financial conditions. If the pound is weak against the euro, then it is a different story regarding the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on concerns about the continuing uncertainty in the White House, while Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gave it little support in her own speech at Jackson Hole. Meanwhile the revival of tensions with North Korea in the wake of the missile launch over Japan and worries about the costs of Hurricane Harvey - and its effect on US economic growth - has also had an impact. So against the dollar, the pound is currently up 0.22% at $1.2960. Meanwhile the euro is at an 18 month high of around $1.20 against the dollar. Unsurprisingly, US markets are expected to open lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average future indicating a 118-point decline amid the North Korea tensions and Hurricane Harvey. Gold is up $4 an ounce at $1321 on fears about where the tensions between the US and North Korea will lead. In a sign of demand for the precious metal, investment firm the Pure Gold Company said it had seen a sharp increase in people buying physical gold. Its chief executive, Josh Saul, said: We have been taking orders since 5am this morning from clients citing fears that tensions between the US and North Korea will escalate after North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest missile test over Japan. President Trump has [previously] vowed to respond with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and many of our clients believe this will make the situation considerably worse, increasing the unpredictability of the geopolitical situation. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a 78% increase in financial professions investing in physical gold on the expectation that the equity markets and the dollar will continue to slip while the gold price rallies. Physical gold investment from first time purchasers has increased by 87% as they worry about market uncertainty in the face of such volatile world leaders. The rise of gold through the $1,300 an ounce barrier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had proved resistant for some while \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is likely to lead to continued support for the precious metal, analysts believe. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: Gold seems to have benefited from the tensions [following the North Korea missile launch], currently trading at a nine-month high. However, most of the gains in the precious metal occurred before the missile launch, meaning that there are different factors supporting prices. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields have been falling since 10 July, with total declines of 10.8%. This partially explains gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 8.6% surge since then, and investors are still not buying Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. Yields should be much higher than current levels, especially since the Fed didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to back off on raising rates. Gary Cohn, head of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Economic Council, has a high probability of replacing Janet Yellen when her term ends by January 2018. Cohn is not only expected to back financial sector deregulation, but also to keep interest rates low in order to support the implementation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-growth economic policies. This provides another valid reason to purchase the yellow metal. With ongoing geopolitical tensions, the looming debt ceiling, threats to scrap Nafta, and a low yield environment, gold prices are likely to remain well supported. $1,300 has been a critical resistance level since the beginning of the year, with four failing attempts to break through; after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge however, $1,300 will likely turn into support. Back with the UK economy, and some weak housing market figures. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the details: UK house prices dipped this month, dragging down the annual growth rate, in further evidence of a cooling market. The average price of a home fell 0.1% between July and August to \u00c2\u00a3210,495, according to Nationwide, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest building society. Prices rose in July and June but fell between March and May, the first time this had happened since the financial crisis. The latest monthly price drop took the annual growth rate back down to 2.1%, a level last seen in May, which was the lowest rate in four years, from 2.9% in July. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The slowdown in house price growth to the 2-3% range in recent months from the 4-5% prevailing in 2016 is consistent with signs of cooling in the housing market and the wider economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted that economic growth had halved from last year to about 0.3% per quarter in the first half of this year and that the number of mortgages approved for house purchase hit a nine-month low in June, while surveyors had reported softening in the number of new buyer inquiries. He said in some respects the slowdown in the housing market was surprising, given the strength of the labour market, while mortgage rates have remained close to all-time lows. But household finances are under mounting pressure, with the cost of living rising steadily as the weak pound bites, and wage growth stagnating. The full report is here: With the costs of Hurricane Harvey estimated by some reports to be as much as $100bn when the final tally comes in, insurers have come under pressure. Lancashire Holdings is down more than 2%, Beazley has fallen 1.6% and Hiscox is 1% lower. Amid concerns about North Korea firing a missile over Japan, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are sliding in early trading. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 1%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac are down 0.9% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has fallen 0.5%. The European Stoxx 600 has hit a six-month low. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to June, in line with the initial estimates and analyst forecasts. This is the third quarter in a row that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP has increased by that amount. Exports bounced back, imports slowed significantly and domestic demand held firm, said statistics agency Insee. But corporate investment decelerated sharply, up by 0.7% after a previous rise of 1.3%. Of course the US president has other things on his plate too. There is his tax overhaul speech on Wednesday, but there is also the problem of the debt ceiling and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat last week to shut down the government if he does get funds for his Mexican border wall. The arrival of Hurricane Harvey and the cost of repairing the damage will only put more pressure on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances, and will not help Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to fund his pet project. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Madden says: Traders are looking ahead to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Wednesday, where he is going to talk about bringing in tax reform, and investors are certainly in favour of the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-business policies, but will the plans get introduced. Mr Trump failed to overhaul the healthcare system, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the Democrats who scuppered his plans, members of his own party opposed it too. What benefits the President, is that tax reform is the sort of policy that you could imagine support coming from both parties. Keeping with US politics, the debt ceiling is looming and Mr Trump has already warned the US government that it risks being shut down if it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the funds to build the wall along the Mexican border. The timing of Hurricane Harvey is adding to the problems as Washington will have to deal with those costs too. Investors are nervous about the potential political gridlock in the US. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response so far to the latest North Korean missile has been fairly measured but investors will be watching what he says or does next. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities says: Stock traders are concerned that if the situation escalates even further then the markets will look for risk-off assets taking bets off the equities. The US futures are also pointing towards a bearish opening and the important question now is what President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is going to be: if the US President opts for a tempered response then stock traders will breathe a sigh of relief but on the opposite case a sharp sell-off can drive the equity indices down to their recent lows. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. News that North Korea had fired a missile over Japan has rattled stock markets, after a calmer period when it looked as though the belligerent words and actions from Kim Jong-un had petered out. Japanese prime minister Shinz\u00c5\ufffd Abe called the missile launch an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented and grave threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security, and both he and US president Donald Trump have vowed to ramp up the pressure on North Korea. But after the initial reaction, traders recovered some of their nerves. The Nikkei 225 is down 0.47%, while the Hang Seng is 0.27% lower. European markets are forecast to be a bit worse off at the open: David Madden,analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Tensions have been running high for a number of weeks now in relation to North Korea, and this move has sent traders running for cover. The situation surrounding North Korea has become more serious now, and we are seeing a risk-off strategy being adopted by traders. There was a knee-jerk reaction to the missile being launched, but after a while traders nerves settled, and we saw a bounce back in equity markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are off the lows of the session. As usual in these circumstances, traders were looking for havens and the yen, ironically, the Swiss franc and gold were in demand. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Investors rushed to the safe haven assets on Tuesday \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the Japanese 10-year yield fell to the lowest level in more than four months. The USDJPY traded at a fresh August low (108.34). Data-wise, the Japanese household spending unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% year-on-year in June. The latest data is bad news for inflation and could have revived the Bank of Japan doves, however the safe haven inflows overshadowed the yen-bears today. As for gold, it climbed to its highest level for nine months, at $1317 an ounce. Elsewhere, crude recovered some of its recent losses as Hurricane Harvey continues to do its damage to Texas and the oil production sites located there. Brent is up 0.44% at $52.12, but again the move was less than might have been expected. Ozkardeskaya said: The re-energized Hurricane Harvey continues devastating the Texas-Louisiana border and companies including Exxon Mobil and Motiva are expected to pause their operations, which should be reflected in US oil inventories over the coming weeks and support a minor recovery in oil prices. Gasoline prices are up for the sixth consecutive session. Our live coverage of the hurricane is here: There are also some nerves in the market before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Wednesday when he is due to announce tax reform plans. These have been one of the key reasons for the market giving the president some leeway despite all the controversy, but there is still doubt as to whether he will be able to push his proposals through Congress. On another thin day for data, we have had the latest Nationwide house price index (of which more shortly) and French GDP is also due soon.",

But while European stock markets lost ground, the euro and the pound were seen by investors as safe haven currencies. The euro has climbed two cents in as many days in reaction to the row brewing between Washington and Kim Jong-un\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. Last week, tensions appeared to ease, but the latest missile launch provoked a demand from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for further action against North Korea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The race to the safe havens has seen the dollar ditched, which is resulting in some fresh and unwelcome sterling and euro strength,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mike van Dulken, the head of research at Accendo Markets. Some commentators said the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a safe haven was increasing its value to a level where it was harming French and German exports, putting pressure on the European Central Bank to implement policies that will prevent the currency rising any further in value. Surveys of business confidence in Germany have fallen back in recent weeks in response to the euro and its impact on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports. Wall Street also suffered as the full impact of the heavy rains from tropical storm Harvey became clearer. More than 30 inches (76cm) have fallen in some areas, leading to widespread flooding, and close to two feet (60cm) more could fall over the next few days. Analysts said the cost of the storm could be about $50bn (\u00c2\u00a343bn). Energy companies also suffered falls following reports that oil producers in Texas had shut wells as a precaution against the storms. The majority of US oil is produced in the Texas region and Goldman Sachs estimated that as much as 17% of production could be affected. Many investors turned to gold as a safe haven, pushing up the price by $4 an ounce to $1,321. In a sign of demand for the precious metal, the investment firm the Pure Gold Company said it had seen a sharp increase in people buying physical gold. Its chief executive, Josh Saul, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have been taking orders from clients citing fears that tensions between the US and North Korea will escalate after North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest missile test over Japan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump has [previously] vowed to respond with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and many of our clients believe this will make the situation considerably worse, increasing the unpredictability of the geopolitical situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The firm reported a 78% increase in clients investing in physical gold on the expectation that the equity markets and the dollar will continue to slip while the gold price rallies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Physical gold investment from first-time purchasers has increased by 87% as they worry about market uncertainty in the face of such volatile world leaders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saul said.",

Economic growth in the Eurozone seems to be stable at around 2% year-on-year for the moment, well above trend growth. The Economic Sentiment Indicator showed improvements in both services and industry, showing the current economic strength is widespread. Production and employment expectations both improved in the industry sector, but a drop off in employment expectations in services shows there could be some levelling off regarding job market recovery in the months ahead.</p> <p>The key takeaway for monetary policy is inflation expectations did not show an uptick. The current weak inflation environment is likely to have continued in August as we expect the inflation rate to have ticked up marginally to 1.4% and core inflation to have remained stable at 1.2%. In fact, it is unlikely that inflation will increase much above 1.5% for the rest of the year and the ESI inflation expectations confirm that. Consumer inflation expectations decreased marginally from 11.7 to 11.6 in August, and industrial selling price expectations were stable but below the March reading. In the service sector, selling price expectations improved marginally, but they are also still below levels seen earlier in the year.</p> <p>The difficult situation of healthy growth and weak inflation continues to trouble the ECB ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting. Although we do expect at least a game plan from the ECB next week and probably a tasking of the relevant committees to investigate tapering options, ongoing weakness in inflation expectations will not make Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life easier.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a67de5e4b0f1f2450ba1d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T09:44:36.864Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those curious about what Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s did with its UK growth forecasts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/30/markets-recover-after-korea-shock-and-ahead-of-us-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-59a6695ee4b0f1f2450ba190#block-59a6695ee4b0f1f2450ba190\">its Global Macroeconomic outlook, </a> it kept them unchanged.

But it has lowered its prediction for the US outlook.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Euro-area-to-achieve-above-potential-growth-over-next--PR_371889\">its Global Macroeconomic Outlook</a> it said the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018 compared to 1.7% last year.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust survey indicators in euro area countries suggest that growth should accelerate through the rest of the year, while the consumer confidence indicator at a 16-year high bodes well for the consumer-driven recovery,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Madhavi Bokil, a vice president at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and author of the report. In detail it says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has revised up Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth forecasts to 2.2% and 2.0% for 2017 and 2018 respectively. Similarly, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has raised its forecasts for France to 1.6% for both 2017 and 2018, from 1.3% and 1.4% as the recovery remains on track, driven by net exports and investment.</p> <p>In Italy, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects that the recovery will also continue to benefit from supportive monetary and fiscal policies, as well as stronger growth in the rest of the European Union. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has revised up its real GDP growth forecast to 1.3% in 2017 and 2018 from 0.8% and 1% respectively.</p> <p> G20 economies will collectively grow at an annual rate of slightly more than 3% in 2017 and 2018, higher than last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.6%. With considerable slack remaining in some euro area economies and some emerging market countries, the current pace of growth around 2% in advanced economies and more than 5% in emerging markets is not only sustainable in the near term, there is potential for upside.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the US:</p> <blockquote> <p>Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects US growth of 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, down from 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The revisions in 2017 are a result of weaker performance in the first half of the year. The lower growth forecast for 2018 reflects expectations of a more modest fiscal stimulus than previously assumed.</p> </blockquote> <p>On actions by central banks, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Monetary policy in the US should continue to tighten this year and next. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also expects euro area monetary policy to become less supportive in 2018, provided that the current growth momentum remains intact. The Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy stance will likely become less accommodative once the 2% inflation target is reached, which the central bank expects in 2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it warned there were a number of risks, not least the situation with North Korea:</p> <blockquote> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A significant escalation of any of the situations in Korea, the South China Sea and other areas could have significant negative credit implications for the global economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Elena Duggar, an associate managing director at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Other risks include a protectionist turn by the US, and any financial market volatility stemming from sudden changes in market expectation regarding monetary policy tightening. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a664b8e4b06fe41d888944\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T07:15:23.248Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide in the wake of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest missile launch, European markets are heading higher in early trading.<br></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.7%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.6% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 0.7% better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a66024e4b0f1f2450ba171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T07:03:58.820Z\">8.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound is having another mixed day, but it is not exactly suffering any dramatic moves so far.</p> <p>Against the dollar, sterling has edged down 0.08% to $1.2909 as the US currency steadies after its recent losses.</p> <p>But against the euro, the pound has recovered a little ground, up 0.04% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0793.</p> <p>Meanwhile gold - which jumped on Tuesday as investors sought havens for their cash - has dipped $1 to $1307 an ounce.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59a65d62e4b0f1f2450ba15a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-30T06:46:56.784Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The economic impact of tropical storm Harvey will not be felt until next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures at the earliest, so the US data to be released later will be considered in the light of the next Federal Reserve meeting and the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate policy.</p> <p>Expectations of another US rate rise in the near future have receded - part of the reason for the recent weakness in the dollar - but stronger than expected figures today and on Friday with the non-farm payroll numbers could see sentiment change again.</p> <p>As it it, the ADP report is expected to show around 185,000 new private sector jobs in August after a 178,000 rise in July.

                "bodyText":"After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls in the wake of the latest North Korean missile launch, markets have regained some of the lost ground. Meanwhile the pound is also recovering after its Brexit-induced weakness. On a busier day for economic data, UK mortgage approvals moved higher but consumer credit slowed. Eurozone economic sentiment also improved and hit a ten year high, although the UK figure showed a decline. In the US, GDP grew by a better than expected 3% annualised in the second quarter, while private sector employment also beat forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.47%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.62% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.58%. But on Wall Street, markets are struggling after President Trump tweeted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153talking is not the answer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regarding North Korea. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It was all looking fairly promising, with better than expected US growth and jobs numbers and Wall Street set to open higher. But then Donald Trump tweeted and raised the tensions with North Korea again: So US markets struggled at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 10 points or 0.06%, the S&amp;P 500 down 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite uup 0.1%. Can the US growth continue? Fidelity International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global economist thinks not. The US growth figures are good news for Donald Trump at least, who promised to boost the economy and increase jobs. The 3% jump in US GDP in the second quarter is more than double the 1.2% increase seen in the first three months of the year. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The acceleration in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected upturns in private inventory investment and federal government spending and an acceleration in PCE [personal consumption expenditure] that were partly offset by downturns in residential fixed investment and state and local government spending and a deceleration in exports. BREAKING: After the ADP jobs data, more evidence of a strong US economy. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by an annualised 3% in the second quarter, up from an initial estimate of 2.6% and expectations of a rise of 2.7%. From the ADP report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In August, the goods-producing sector saw the best performance in months with solid increases in both construction and manufacturing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Additionally, the trade industry pulled ahead to lead job gains across all industries, adding the most jobs it has seen since the end of 2016. This could be an industry to watch as consumer spending and wage growth improves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The job market continues to power forward. Job creation is strong across nearly all industries, company sizes. Mounting labor shortages are set to get much worse. The initial BLS employment estimate is often very weak in August due to measurement problems, and is subsequently revised higher. The ADP number is not impacted by those problems.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the widely watched US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, a private sector payroll survey has substantially beaten expectations. The ADP jobs report shows US private sector employment increased by 237,000 in August, compared with a 178,000 rise in July and expectations of a 185,000 increase. Here is a breakdown of the German inflation figure, from the Federal Statistics Office: Inflation figures just out from Germany show a higher than expected figure for August. The harmonised consumer price index - using the same methodology across the European Union - came in at 1.8% year on year compared to forecasts of 1.7 which was also the July figure. The month on month figure was also higher than expected at 0.2% rather than 0.1%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the UK consumer credit figures: The rapid growth in borrowing by consumers appears to be slowing amid a squeeze on households, despite remaining at levels unseen since the financial crisis. The annual rate of growth for consumer borrowing through credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans slowed to 9.8% in July, the lowest rate of expansion since April 2016, according to the Bank of England. The growth rate was a little weaker than in recent months, when the pace of expansion was above 10%. Spending by British consumers is growing at the weakest rate in almost three years, as households come under pressure to tighten their belts from higher prices fuelled by a drop in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. Wages rose by 2.1% in June, while inflation stood at 2.6% in July, leading to negative earnings growth. The figures come as research from Citizens Advice suggests credit card lenders may be targeting people struggling with unaffordable levels of debt, a practice that it said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog should ban. Weaker levels of growth in consumer credit could relieve pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates to slow the rapid expansion in the supply of money. Sluggish GDP growth and inflation coming close to its peak could put off a rate rise until late 2018, or even early 2019. The full story is here: The pound is holding steady against both the dollar and euro after its recent Brexit-induced weakness. It is up 0.027% at $1.2927 and 0.3% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0821. Economic sentiment in the eurozone may be holding up, but the same cannot be said for the UK, judging from the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. The overall index for the UK fell from 113.2 to 109.6, with construction and consumer sentiment particularly weak. European markets have lost some of their earlier gains but remain in positive territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wednesday rebound lost some of its shine as the day went on, with investors perhaps struggling to justify their initial cheeriness. The FTSE saw its gains shrink from 0.6% to 0.2%, in large part due to a reversal from Brent Crude, which is once again threatening to fall below $51.50 per barrel. This in turn erased BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early growth and sent Shell lower by half a percent, explaining the UK index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own slowing. The FTSE also wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempt at a comeback against the euro, sterling climbing above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.08 with a 0.4% increase. Like the FTSE, the DAX and CAC fell from their morning peak, and are now up 0.4% apiece. This despite the euro dropping 0.4% against both the dollar and the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though in the grand scheme of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summer that kind of pull back is a hill of beans compared to its mountainous climb. Not everyone believes the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent weakness may not last. Peter Rosenstreich at Swissquote Bank says: Although the pound has recovered slightly against the US dollar and the Euro, it is not a sustainable course. The Bank of England remains dovish: the central bank will not tighten money until there is clear political direction around Brexit. One key indicator will come in October, as the major parties hold their conferences. Investors will also be watching German elections. A decisive victory by Chancellor Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christian Democrats will boost the Euro. She and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President Emmanuel Macron intend to cooperate in advancing the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial integration. GBP/USD is consolidating around 1.30, while EUR/GBP has no real resistance till 0.9415. EUR/USD should top 1.20, and favourable European economic/political conditions suggest further upside for the pair. After the latest eurozone sentiment survey and ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the European Central Bank, economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said: The August survey indicators all point to some modest improvements compared to July, but the main message is that the economy maintains a healthy cruising speed. Economic growth in the Eurozone seems to be stable at around 2% year-on-year for the moment, well above trend growth. The Economic Sentiment Indicator showed improvements in both services and industry, showing the current economic strength is widespread. Production and employment expectations both improved in the industry sector, but a drop off in employment expectations in services shows there could be some levelling off regarding job market recovery in the months ahead. The key takeaway for monetary policy is inflation expectations did not show an uptick. The current weak inflation environment is likely to have continued in August as we expect the inflation rate to have ticked up marginally to 1.4% and core inflation to have remained stable at 1.2%. In fact, it is unlikely that inflation will increase much above 1.5% for the rest of the year and the ESI inflation expectations confirm that. Consumer inflation expectations decreased marginally from 11.7 to 11.6 in August, and industrial selling price expectations were stable but below the March reading. In the service sector, selling price expectations improved marginally, but they are also still below levels seen earlier in the year. The difficult situation of healthy growth and weak inflation continues to trouble the ECB ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting. Although we do expect at least a game plan from the ECB next week and probably a tasking of the relevant committees to investigate tapering options, ongoing weakness in inflation expectations will not make Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life easier. For those curious about what Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s did with its UK growth forecasts in its Global Macroeconomic outlook, it kept them unchanged. Here are the full forecasts: Eurozone economic sentiment came in higher than forecast in August, thanks to optimism in the industrial and service sectors, and among consumers. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentiment index rose from 111.3 in July to 111.9, better than the 111.3 expected and hitting a ten year high. The figures for the EU as a whole was more or less static (-0.3 points to 111.9), just below its 10-year high of July. And more from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lending figures: More on UK consumer credit: Despite July being a traditionally quiet month for the UK housing market, mortgage approvals for that month have come in higher than analyst forecasts. They rose from 65,318 in June to 68,689 last month, according to the Bank of England, better than the 65,500 expected. But consumer credit rose by less than forecast, up \u00c2\u00a31.179bn compared to expectations of a \u00c2\u00a31.5bn increase and down on June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of \u00c2\u00a31.351bn. That was the smallest increase this year. Back with the US, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tax reforms will add billions to the already burgeoning US debt mountain, it has been claimed. Speaking of the pound, some analysts believe its current weakness - due in large part to the tortuous Brexit talks - may not last. Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: It is looking increasingly like grid-lock [in the Brexit discussion] and we may need some compromise at a higher level to move forward. That might not come until later in the year, which would mean negotiations being behind schedule. This potential delay is the dominant driver of pound selling that has now taken EUR/GBP to levels that look very much over-extended. While the negative Brexit sentiment could certainly take the pound lower still over the coming weeks, a continued slide in the pound NEER [nominal effective exchange rate] value assumption \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently averaging 76.650 on a year-to-date basis - would start to add to the inflation overshoot. If the economic data was to show some improvement, then that combination would help provide support for the pound. So we remain sceptical of how much further scope there is for pound selling. On the market recovery, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With little yet to come from North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest missile launch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including an unusually restrained comment from Donald Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the markets felt free to rebound this Wednesday. The European indices were fairly uniform in their gains after the bell. The FTSE jumped 40 or so points, pushing the index to the upper end of the 7300 to 7400 trading bracket it has found itself in for the last 3 weeks. Alongside the general reversal of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses the FTSE also benefited from Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight rise; the black stuff is now tickling $52 per barrel having slipped under $51.50 on Tuesday, allowing BP and Shell to pull back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. Over in the Eurozone the situation was much the same, with the DAX and CAC climbing 0.5% to 0.6% apiece. However, unlike in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where a similar rise effectively reclaimed Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such growth could only take the tip off of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone plunge. Tuesday saw the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses exacerbated by the latest romp from the euro, so the German and French indices will be happy to see the currency has calmed somewhat this Wednesday. Against the dollar it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 0.4%, and back below $1.195 having crossed $1.205 during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak, while against the pound the euro has slipped 0.2% (though sterling is still trapped underneath \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.08). Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has raised its growth forecasts for Germany, France and Italy, and says the eurozone can expect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above potential\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd growth this year and next. But it has lowered its prediction for the US outlook. In its Global Macroeconomic Outlook it said the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018 compared to 1.7% last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust survey indicators in euro area countries suggest that growth should accelerate through the rest of the year, while the consumer confidence indicator at a 16-year high bodes well for the consumer-driven recovery,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Madhavi Bokil, a vice president at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and author of the report. In detail it says: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has revised up Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth forecasts to 2.2% and 2.0% for 2017 and 2018 respectively. Similarly, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has raised its forecasts for France to 1.6% for both 2017 and 2018, from 1.3% and 1.4% as the recovery remains on track, driven by net exports and investment. In Italy, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects that the recovery will also continue to benefit from supportive monetary and fiscal policies, as well as stronger growth in the rest of the European Union. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has revised up its real GDP growth forecast to 1.3% in 2017 and 2018 from 0.8% and 1% respectively. G20 economies will collectively grow at an annual rate of slightly more than 3% in 2017 and 2018, higher than last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.6%. With considerable slack remaining in some euro area economies and some emerging market countries, the current pace of growth around 2% in advanced economies and more than 5% in emerging markets is not only sustainable in the near term, there is potential for upside. As for the US: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects US growth of 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, down from 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively. The revisions in 2017 are a result of weaker performance in the first half of the year. The lower growth forecast for 2018 reflects expectations of a more modest fiscal stimulus than previously assumed. On actions by central banks, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: Monetary policy in the US should continue to tighten this year and next. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also expects euro area monetary policy to become less supportive in 2018, provided that the current growth momentum remains intact. The Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy stance will likely become less accommodative once the 2% inflation target is reached, which the central bank expects in 2019. But it warned there were a number of risks, not least the situation with North Korea: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A significant escalation of any of the situations in Korea, the South China Sea and other areas could have significant negative credit implications for the global economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Elena Duggar, an associate managing director at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Other risks include a protectionist turn by the US, and any financial market volatility stemming from sudden changes in market expectation regarding monetary policy tightening. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide in the wake of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest missile launch, European markets are heading higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.7%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.6% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 0.7% better. The pound is having another mixed day, but it is not exactly suffering any dramatic moves so far. Against the dollar, sterling has edged down 0.08% to $1.2909 as the US currency steadies after its recent losses. But against the euro, the pound has recovered a little ground, up 0.04% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0793. Meanwhile gold - which jumped on Tuesday as investors sought havens for their cash - has dipped $1 to $1307 an ounce. The economic impact of tropical storm Harvey will not be felt until next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures at the earliest, so the US data to be released later will be considered in the light of the next Federal Reserve meeting and the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate policy. Expectations of another US rate rise in the near future have receded - part of the reason for the recent weakness in the dollar - but stronger than expected figures today and on Friday with the non-farm payroll numbers could see sentiment change again. As it it, the ADP report is expected to show around 185,000 new private sector jobs in August after a 178,000 rise in July. Second quarter GDP is forecast to rise from the initial estimate of 2.6% to 2.7% or even 2.8%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets look a little calmer after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide in the wake of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provocative missile launch over Japan. Investors took some reassurance from President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively measured response. Stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all options are on the table\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a lot less bellicose than promising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so after an early fall the Dow Jones Industrial Average actually ended in positive territory, up 0.26%. The positive mood has filtered through to Asia, with the Hang Seng up 0.94% and the Nikkei 225 0.72% better. So European markets are expected to recover a little of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost ground: But some believe the markets may be too calm, given the tensions with North Korea and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of more action in the region. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Having seen stock markets in Asia and Europe drop sharply and the traditional haven trades rally in the aftermath of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provocative missile launch over Japan earlier this week, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a surprise to see US markets follow suit. Despite the escalation in tension and the universal condemnation the missile launch has provoked, US markets, despite initially opening sharply lower, rallied strongly in the afternoon session to close the day higher. It is true that flare ups on the Korean peninsula are nothing new and previous instances have always resulted in a winding back of tension, and it would appear that US investors have decided that recent events are likely to go the same way, as the markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153muscle memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of selling the panic and then buying the dip kicked in. In ordinary circumstances this might seem sensible, however the events of the last few weeks can hardly be described as ordinary, which suggests that markets could be being rather na\u00c3\u00afve that current events can be contained. President Trump of course also has to contend with the devastating floods from tropical storm Harvey, both the damage done and the cost to the US economy. Our live coverage of the impact of the storm is here: On top of that, he is expected to give more details of his long awaited tax reform programme. It is also a fairly busy day for data as the month comes to and end. Still with the US, there are second quarter GDP figures and the latest private payroll numbers, which are scoured for clues to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll numbers. In the UK there are the latest bank lending and mortgage figures, and in Germany, inflation data for August. The Agenda: 9.30 BST UK consumer credit and mortgage lending (July) 10.00 BST Eurozone confidence figures (August) 13.00 BST German inflation (August) 13.15 BST US ADP employment data (August) 13.30 BST US GDP (second quarter)",

It comes as the country prepares to further ease capital controls. <em>Helena Smith reports from Athens: </em></p> <p>Reaping the dividends of a bumper tourism season, Greece saw its economic sentiment indicator rise to 99 points this month from 98.2 points in July. While the index is still in negative territory - optimism is only measured at 100 points - it was the strongest in 12 months and is being interpreted as another turning point for the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest economy. </p> <p>In another sign of growing confidence in the Greek economy, the leftist-led government is to allow bank depositors to withdraw more of their savings as of tomorrow (September 1st). The move will see the cap on withdrawals being increased by 7% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,800 a month.

All of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets are in firmly positive territory, and Wall Street has open higher. It is looking less rosy for the pound, which was unable to hold on above $1.29 after Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, raised fresh concerns about how talks are going. The pound is currently down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2871. Over in France, supermarket group Carrefour issued a profits warning, prompting a heavy share sell-off. Shares are currently down 14%. Eurozone inflation picked up to 1.5% in August from 1.3% in July, while the jobless rate was unchanged at 9.1% (in July). In the UK, the big corporate news was that online gambling firm 888 was handed a record \u00c2\u00a37.8m fine by the regulator for failing to protect vulnerable customers. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, stepped up his argument for an immediate rise in UK interest rates. On that note we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments and please join us again tomorrow. AM US markets have maintained the upbeat sentiment in European markets with Wall Street climbing higher in early trading: Dow Jones: +0.3% at 21,958 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,464 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 6,390 Over in the US, initial jobless claims have come in slightly below expectations. There were 236,000 new claims for jobless benefits in the week ending 26 August - 1,000 more than in than in the previous week - according to the US Labor Department figures. It was a little below the 237,000 forecast by economists. Tomorrow is the big day for US jobs data, with the closely watched non-farm payrolls report for August to be published at 13.30 (BST). Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting that 180,000 were added this month, following 209,000 in July. Shilen Shah, bond strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says Barnier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have longer term implications for UK assets: The risk of no transitionary agreement seems to have increased today given the strong word\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator. His not unexpected comments has led to a modest weakening in sterling, however it also increases the chance of the UK exiting the EU in a disorderly fashion. The key hazard for markets is that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disagreement is an indicator of where future negotiations are heading, with the danger that the risk-premium on UK assets will widen if the talks implode with no agreement. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee is feeling the effects of the weaker pound today: Here is our full story on the latest round of Brexit talks: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses have widened against the dollar and it is now down 0.5% at $1.2856. Sterling has been knocked further since Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, said that no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had been achieved after the third round of talks in Brussels. He told a news conference: Over the course of this week we have made a number of useful clarifications on a number of points, for instance the status of border workers. However, we did not get any decisive progress on any of the principle subjects, even though on the discussion we had about Ireland - that discussion was fruitful. European markets have extended gains this afternoon. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,414 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.6% at 12,074 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.7% at 5,092 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +1% at 21,717 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.8% at 10,327 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.8% at 374 German data this morning showed that the number of people out of work in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy fell by 5,000 in August to 2.53m. It disappointed expectations, with economists forecasting a bigger fall of 6,000. Rainer Sartoris, economist at HSBC, said the fall in German unemployment was slowing: The slowdown in the pace of falling unemployment is likely linked to more and more refugees starting to search for a job, as they exit training courses (e.g. language courses). This trend is likely to continue over the coming quarters, which could constrain a further improvement in the number of unemployed. Over in Greece, tourism is helping to boost economic sentiment according to the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, Eurostat. It comes as the country prepares to further ease capital controls. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Reaping the dividends of a bumper tourism season, Greece saw its economic sentiment indicator rise to 99 points this month from 98.2 points in July. While the index is still in negative territory - optimism is only measured at 100 points - it was the strongest in 12 months and is being interpreted as another turning point for the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest economy. In another sign of growing confidence in the Greek economy, the leftist-led government is to allow bank depositors to withdraw more of their savings as of tomorrow (September 1st). The move will see the cap on withdrawals being increased by 7% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,800 a month. As part of the relaxation, opening of new accounts will be facilitated for farmers, companies and freelancers. The restrictive measures were imposed at the height of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis in the summer of 2015 amid fears of a run on banks. However, it has not been lost on many that total annual withdrawals will actually amount to less. Under the new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relaxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rules, depositors will be able to withdraw \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21,600 euro a year, compared with \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21,840 under the old rules. French supermarket group Carrefour has suffered a heavy share sell-off this morning after a profit warning from the retailer spooked investors. Shares are currently down nearly 15%, putting the company on track for its biggest daily fall in 20 years. Carrefour reported weaker-than-expected first-half results and warned that full-year profits could fall by 12%. The retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief executive, Alexandre Bompard, had this to say: Our 2017 results will be impacted by our first-half performance and an operating environment that will remain difficult in the second half in some countries. The negative news from Carrefour spread throughout the supermarket sector, making UK grocers among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: Tesco is down 1.3% at 180p Morrisons is down 0.7% at 244p Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is down 0.6% at 234p The retail index has been among the worst performers in Europe this year as competition and structural pressures mount. Paul Harper, equity analyst at DNB Bank, says its partly down to Amazon: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tough time for the sector, with the more macro theme that Amazon is slowly eating everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch, though that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case in Europe to the same extent as the US. Another problem is that the retail sector is relatively highly priced, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really much room for disappointment. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist for the eurozone at ING, said higher-than-expected inflation in the region would give ammunition to those members of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council who favour tighter policy. He is not convinced, however: The hawks within the governing council will argue that deflationary pressures have now clearly disappeared. But given the risk that an overshoot of the euro exchange rate could push inflation back below 1.5%, caution remains warranted in removing monetary policy accommodation. We believe that the ECB will announce a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish tapering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in October, giving the markets the impression that quantitative easing could be lengthened into the second half of next year, if need be. At the same time we think that a deposit rate hike is not to be expected before the end of 2018. Unemployment in the single currency bloc was unchanged in July at 9.1% - the lowest since February 2009. It compared with a jobless rate of 7.7% in the wider EU. The number of unemployed people in the eurozone rose by 73,000 in July, to 14.86m, according to the Eurostat figures. Here is how it looks across the European Union: Eurozone inflation rose to 1.5% in August, from 1.3% in July, according to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flash estimate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Eurostat. It was higher than the 1.4% rate forecast by economists, and the main driver of the rise was energy, with prices up 4% year-on-year. Here is the breakdown: Core inflation - which strips out food and energy - was unchanged at 1.3% in August. Economists predicted a slight dip to 1.2%. The pound has slipped below $1.29, and is currently down 0.2% at $1.2896. Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank, says concerns about the way Brexit talks are going are weighing on the pound: Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on sterling, and if there is a protracted spell of weakness then policymakers may come out to support the currency as it pushes up headline inflation. Against the euro, the pound is down 0.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0832. The top FTSE 100 risers this morning are dominated by mining companies, which tend to benefit from data that signals strong demand from China. All major European markets are up this morning, boosted by stronger-than-expected manufacturing growth in China, positive US data, and easing tension over North Korea. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,400 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.5% at 12,064 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% at 5,072 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 21,581 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,305 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 372 Here is our full story on the speech by Michael Saunders, Bank of England policymaker, in Cardiff: Michael Saunders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest call for a rise in rates has failed to lift the pound this morning. Sterling is down 0.2% against the dollar but is still holding on above $1.29 at $1.2902. Saunders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments will come as a surprise to few, after his vote for a hike at the last two meetings, but the exchange rate is also reflective of dollar strength. Stronger-than-expected US data on Wednesday has raised investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again before the end of the year, sending the dollar broadly higher. The pound meanwhile is also down -0.2% against the euro this morning, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.0850. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, has stepped up his argument that the UK needs an immediate rise in interest rates. Predicting that inflation would hit 3% in the coming months (well above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2%) target, Saunders told an audience in Cardiff: Our foot no longer needs to be quite so firmly on the accelerator in my view. A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target over time. He said that raising rates now would allow a more gradual pace of hikes, making it easier for people to adjust to higher borrowing rates. There are considerable advantages to acting early enough to allow a gradual rise in interest rates. It is fully 10 years since the MPC last tightened monetary policy. Many borrowers have never faced a rate hike. It would be preferable to have the space to move gradually, observing the effects as we go. If we get behind the curve, we lose that space. Saunders has voted for a 0.25 point rise in rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from a current all-time low of 0.25% - at the last two meetings of the MPC. He has yet to convince the majority of his colleagues, with only one other MPC member - Ian McCafferty - joining him in the vote for a rise. In response to the Gambling Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine, 888 said: It was never 888\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention to benefit financially from this technical failure and we have completed a detailed process to identify all affected customers. The group is refunding customers who were able to continue playing when they should have been excluded across 888\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platforms. The Gambling Commission said 888\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record \u00c2\u00a37.8m fine for failing to protect thousands of vulnerable customers will be divided in the following way: a \u00c2\u00a33.5m repayment of deposits made by self excluded customers (whose accounts were left accessible) a \u00c2\u00a362,000 compensation payment to the employer from whom money was stolen by a problem gambler (that 888 failed to spot/stop) a further \u00c2\u00a34.25m will be paid to a socially responsible cause to invest in measures to tackle gambling-related harm Sarah Harrison, chief executive at the Gambling Commission: Safeguarding consumers is not optional. This penalty package of just under \u00c2\u00a38m reflects the seriousness of 888\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failings to protect vulnerable customers. The 888 sanction package will ensure those affected don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose out, that the operator pays the price for its failings via a sum that will go to tackling gambling-related harm, and that independent assurance will be given to see that lessons are learnt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 888, one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest online gambling firms, has been fined a record \u00c2\u00a37.8m by the regulator for failing to protect thousands of vulnerable customers. An investigation by the Gambling Commission found that over 7,000 customers who had chosen to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self exclude\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (people who flag that they wish to stop gambling for at least six months) were still able to access their 888 accounts due to a technical failure. It meant that vulnerable customers were able to deposit \u00c2\u00a33.5m into their accounts, and then continue to gamble, for over 13 months. 888 also failed to spot \u00e2\u20ac\u0153visible signs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of problem behaviour from one individual, which was so significant it resulted in criminal activity, the watchdog said. That particular customer staked over \u00c2\u00a31.3m, including \u00c2\u00a355,000 stolen from their employer. During a 13 month period the customer gambled on average 3-4 hours a day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Growth in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector accelerated unexpectedly in August, reassuring global investors that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy is still growing at a decent pace. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official manufacturing PMI index rose to 51.7 in August from 51.4 in July, confounding economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for a small decline. (Anything above 50 signals growth.) Along with stronger Q2 growth and jobs figures from the US on Wednesday, the Chinese PMI figures are expected to lift investor sentiment after a torrid week of heightened tensions over North Korea. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic rose on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c largely because of a relatively measured response from President Trump - and European markets are expected to open higher this morning: Also coming up today: 08.25 BST Speech by Michael Saunders, member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee 08.45 BST German unemployment (August) 10.00 BST Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash estimate of inflation (August) 13.30 BST US weekly jobless claims",
