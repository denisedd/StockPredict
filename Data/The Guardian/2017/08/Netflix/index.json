The aim is to repeat Disney\u2019s success with Marvel, where the creator of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy has become a launchpad for multibillion-dollar film franchises. </p> <p>Here are four ways in which Netflix can make a global success of Millarworld properties, a job made tougher as the deal does not include founder Mark Millar\u2019s best-known properties: Kick-Ass and Kingsman. </p> <h2>1. Create a superhero universe</h2> <p>The latest trend in Hollywood is to create a \u201cuniverse\u201d from a group of characters. Disney has the Avengers ensemble, which includes characters such as Captain America, Thor and Iron Man \u2013 who also have their own standalone films. This is not about flogging a concept through a series of sequels but building up a series of characters that can flit across multiple films (and probably TV series in the case of Netflix). Warner Brothers is tapping into this approach by expanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/25/dc-comics-reboot-batman-superman-wonder-woman\">its DC Comics heroes</a> \u2013 Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman \u2013 into a universe under the Justice League banner. Universal is developing its so-called \u201cdark universe\u201d of monster films ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/07/the-mummy-review-tom-cruise\">The Mummy</a>, the Invisible Man, and Dracula to vampire hunter Van Helsing.</p> <p>Millarworld has so far developed 18 character franchises. Three of these \u2013 Wanted, Kick-Ass and Kingsman \u2013 have so far made the successful jump to the big screen grossing about $1bn (\u00a3770m) at the box office. However, Kingsman and Kick-Ass are licensed to other producers. Netflix releases films in cinemas but its main business is streaming content to subscribers so it referred to TV series and kids\u2019 shows as well as films. </p> <p>Netflix is banking on Millarworld introducing viewers to a new universe of hitherto unknown worlds \u2013 with franchises including Jupiter\u2019s Legacy about a dysfunctional superhero family, a gifted petrol station worker called Huck and Duke McQueen, \u201ca space age hero who may be a little past his prime\u201d \u2013 that will become household names. </p> <p>Like Disney\u2019s Avengers, Millar says the \u201cvast tapestry of characters and superteams\u201d all tie together, which Netflix will convert into a range of TV and film projects for its more than 100m global subscribers. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/07/netflix-comic-book-kick-ass-kingsman-marvel-disney-millarworld\">Netflix buys comic book company behind Kick-Ass and Kingsman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome of the Millarworld comics have been made into some big films.
