                "bodyText":"When a male customer grabbed Melissa\u2019s breast, she didn\u2019t bother reporting it to DoorDash, the on-demand food delivery service that hired her as a driver. She didn\u2019t think the company would care. When a different customer had sexually harassed her a month earlier \u2013 texting her a pornographic video through the app \u2013 DoorDash did little to help, she said. The company canceled the order, but allowed the man to continue sending her multiple messages. \u201cI felt very fearful. I felt very alone,\u201d said Melissa, 32, who asked to use only her first name. \u201cI questioned whether I wanted to continue to do this, but I\u2019m financially dependent on it. This is my income.\u201d In recent months, Silicon Valley has faced widespread backlash surrounding the sexual misconduct and discrimination that some say is rampant in the male-dominated tech industry. But almost entirely overlooked amid the public outrage is the massive pool of low-wage workers \u2013 especially in the sharing economy \u2013 who are vulnerable to a wide range of abuses on the job because they lack basic labor rights. And while corporate scandals continue to make headlines \u2013 most recently involving a Google engineer\u2019s memo criticizing diversity initiatives \u2013 there has been minimal scrutiny of the harassment, abuse and discrimination the tech products have enabled by connecting strangers through the internet. That includes sexual assaults of Uber drivers and food deliverers, physical attacks and racist abuse by Airbnb hosts, and violent threats on Twitter, Facebook and dating apps. \u201cWe have to talk about this as a problem these platforms have created,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a University of Miami law professor who studies online abuse. \u201c[If you\u2019re] going to set up a platform to make it possible for people to instantaneously communicate with people they don\u2019t know ... you know full well it\u2019s going to be abused and weaponized.\u201d \u2018You\u2019re on your own\u2019 In the same way that female engineers and startup founders struggle to report harassment for fear of retaliation or lost funding, gig economy workers are in precarious positions when they are victimized, since they aren\u2019t classified as employees. \u201cDoorDash is like, \u2018You\u2019re an independent contractor. You\u2019re in business for yourself. You know the risks. You\u2019re on your own,\u2019\u201d said Melissa, who has been driving full-time for the company since last fall. A spokesperson said that in the case of the man who sent her pornography, the customer was deactivated, though there was a five-minute window when he could still text her. The success of many on-demand companies like DoorDash depends on hiring a large, cheap workforce of contract employees who have no benefits or job security. That\u2019s the model for a wide range of companies, including the taxi apps Uber and Lyft, and other delivery services, such as GrubHub, UberEats, Caviar, Instacart and Postmates. The companies argue that drivers can be their own bosses and enjoy flexible hours. But some workers say they can\u2019t make ends meet and are ignored when they complain about working conditions. Saba Waheed, research director at the University of California, Los Angeles, labor center, argued that if the firms allowed workers to unionize or treated them like employees, then drivers would have legal means to speak up and the companies would be more liable for their safety. \u201cThere has to be a more direct responsibility. You\u2019re earning so much profit off of this workforce.\u201d The corporations\u2019 inaction can be especially painful when workers are harassedand threatened on the job, facing the kinds of misconduct that human resources departments would be obligated to investigate if the offenses were happening to office employees. Grace, an Uber driver in her 50s who works in San Francisco, where the company is headquartered, said she had been groped by passengers four times in three years. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t believe that most women could handle these situations that I\u2019ve been in,\u201d said Grace, who requested not to use her full name out of fear that Uber would retaliate. When passengers mistreat her, she said, she typically gave them low ratings, but did not raise concerns to Uber because she worried reporting could get her in trouble. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid of being deactivated, because I need the money,\u201d said Grace, who said it was common for her to feel unsafe with drunk and belligerent passengers. She recounted one incident when she said she turned down a group of riders because there were too many for her car, leading one to grow angry and kick the vehicle. The Guardian has previously reported on two women who drove for Uber and said they were violently assaulted by passengers. They said Uber did little to support them and the company failed to work with police to help bring charges. Dolores Benitez, who used to be a New York City taxi driver but now works for Uber and other ride-sharing companies, said she had dealt with passengers physically fighting in her car and riders having sex. One intoxicated rider began aggressively kicking her seat when he thought she was going the wrong way, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a partition in the car. If the person wants to do something to you, they will do it,\u201d said Benitez, 64, adding that she felt the companies would generally side with the passengers if there were disputes about misconduct. \u201cIt\u2019s your word against their word. They, as passengers, have the rights.\u201d Uber has noted that it investigates reports of harassment and assault by passengers and bans them from the platform as a result. A spokesperson said the company had a 24/7 incident response team and that drivers could easily connect to live representatives to report problems. DoorDash said in a statement: \u201cWe investigate reports of inappropriate behavior and take action to deactivate those individuals from the platform that violate our policies,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile sometimes we may fall short of our customer experience goals, we\u2019re constantly working to learn from these experiences and respond to them even faster.\u201d While highly paid tech workers have complained about dysfunctional HR operations, gig economy drivers lament the fact they can struggle to even get a human on the phone when they are facing dangerous situations on the job. Often, drivers receive automated replies to their complaints. Arlena Bain, a driver for Instacart, which offers on-demand grocery deliveries, said she has felt vulnerable working in remote areas with no cell service. \u201cThey make us drive to these really unsafe zones \u2013 places that nobody wanted to deliver to,\u201d she said, adding that she did not turn down trips for fear that it would hurt her standing with the company. \u201cWe\u2019re so replaceable to them.\u201d Melissa, the DoorDash driver, said she wished the tech companies would be more respectful to the people who allowed the businesses to flourish.

Franks, the law professor, said sites like Facebook and Twitter attracted \u201copportunistic harassers\u201d, by rewarding impulsive behavior and making it easy for them to inflict serious damage on victims with just a few clicks. On a fundamental level, the companies resisted substantive changes to their services that would limit abusive content, because they were driven by the overarching goal of maximizing engagement and use, said Franks, who is also the legislative and tech policy director with the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get a drop off in participation. In other words, they\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll work.\u201d In the case of revenge porn or \u201cnonconsensual pornography\u201d \u2013 when abusers spread sexually explicit images of victims without their consent \u2013 it can feel impossible for those who are targeted to protect themselves or get help from tech platforms.

                "bodyText":"There was little in Mario Draghi\u2019s comments in Germany on Wednesday to indicate that the European Central Bank plans to stop pumping cheap money in to the eurozone anytime soon. Some expected him to use the platform of a speech to a gathering of Nobel economics laureates and students to say that a long period of growth across the 19-member currency bloc warranted a reduction in the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing stimulus programme. It\u2019s more than two years since Draghi announced a \u20ac1.1tn bond-buying programme at a rate of \u20ac60bn a month to act as a drip feed for the ailing eurozone economy. At its launch, Draghi said the scheme would end in September 2017, but the patient\u2019s waning energy levels meant this was subsequently extended into next year. There are still good months and bad months for the eurozone, but in the main, it is looking healthier than at any time in the last five years and many Germans in particular, keen for higher interest on their savings, want the drip withdrawn and interest rates to rise. To emphasise the point, eurozone economic surveys for July were buoyed by improvements in manufacturing output while employment continued to grow and business investment remained stable. The data provider Markit said its combined purchasing managers\u2019 index, which covers manufacturing, services and construction industries, edged higher from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing exports improved significantly.

It also needs a chief operating officer, an engineering chief, a driverless car tech boss and a new company president. The last on, Jeff Jones, quit afetr six months because he said Uber was incompatible with his values. Tackle political opposition National and municipal governments around the world have lined up to put legal roadblocks in Uber\u2019s way, spurred on by vocal taxi lobby groups. From Brussels to Berlin and Rome to Rio de Janeiro, the San Francisco-based firm has been shelling out eye-watering sums on lawyers. Fend off competition Uber may be the best known ride-hailing service but it faces stiff competition from the likes of Lyft, which is quietly wooing customers while Uber acts as a lightning rod for criticism of their shared industry. In China, Uber gave up the ghost and surrendered its business to domestic champion Didi Chuxing. Fighting bribery allegations Closer to home, the fearsome US Department of Justice is investigating whether Uber executives breached the stringent Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which deals with bribery of foreign officials. Dealing with \u2018Greyball\u2019 inquiry As if one DoJ investigation was not enough, prosecutors are also examining whether Uber misused software known as \u201cGreyball\u201d, which it uses to block potentially fraudulent or dangerous customers. Uber allegedly used Greyball to deny rides to officials who might have been investigating its compliance with regulations. War with Waymo (Google) Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is suing Uber. It claims former employee Anthony Levandowski took trade secrets to Uber after leaving Waymo and the joining self-driving truck firm Otto, which Uber then bought. A driverless future? The Waymo suit raises questions about how far and how fast Uber is heading towards a driverless future. Uber has struck deals with auto firms including Ford to research driverless technology but how much of its money should be spent on developing tech it could simply buy at a later date? Take on Transport for London The capital\u2019s transport body wants private hire cab drivers in the UK capital to take English tests, including a written essay segment. Uber is fighting a protracted courtroom battle against this, saying the requirement for good written English is needless and will put drivers out of business. Settle SoftBank investment issue Japan\u2019s SoftBank, known for its fondness for technology start-ups, has been pondering whether to invest in either Uber or Lyft. The change of chief executive could tip the balance in Uber\u2019s favour. Take on Trump Donald Trump can send company\u2019s share prices into a nosedive with a single tweet. Uber is not listed but Khosrowshahi could still feel the force of the US president. Like Kalanick before him, Khosrowshahi has been a vocal critic of Trump \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t pay to have the White House as an enemy. To fly or not to fly? Supposedly, Uber could be testing flying cars in Dallas and Dubai by 2020. Now Uber is under new management, will that be pie in the sky or something to spend investors\u2019 money on? Uber Freight Uber Freight allows companies to hire independent truck drivers to make deliveries. Now Uber owns Otto, it will have to decide how big the opportunity for driverless freight really is. Make nice with the neighbours Uber has been weighing up plans to move away from its HQ from San Francisco, across the Bay to Oakland. It now appears likely to scale back this plan.
