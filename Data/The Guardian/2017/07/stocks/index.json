                "bodyText":"With Wall Street closed for the Independence Day holiday, it looks like a quiet afternoon lies ahead. So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised the pressure on UK lenders not to offer credit recklessly. The central bank is demanding proof that loans are being made in a sensible fashion, following growing concern that an unsustainable credit bubble is building. The BoE is particularly concerned about the growth in 0% teaser credit card deals, and PCP car loans. Both areas could trigger steep losses for lenders if the economy deteriorates. The latest economic data shows that UK builders expanded at a slower rate in June, after a strong May. Economists say that political uncertainty, due to Brexit and the hung parliament, is putting clients off committing to new projects. The split at the Bank of England over interest rates has widened yet further. Policymaker Ian McCafferty has argued that it would be prudent to raise borrowing costs now, but fellow MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better to wait, given the slowing economy. European Central Bank chief economist Peter Praet has also sounded dovish, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early for the ECB to declare victory and start unwinding its stimulus. In the City, shares in payments group Worldpay have surged by 30%, after it received two takeover bids. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are in the red, with North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missile test hitting sentiment. Worldpay, though, has dragged the FTSE 100 back up into the green.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s may be all for today, tho we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back if anything dramatic happens.... Just in: The European Union has approved Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi. Bloomberg has the details: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena won formal European Union approval to receive a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.4bn ($6.1bn) capital injection from the Italian government in return for further restructuring of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank. The European Commission has approved Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to support the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recapitalization under EU rules, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the basis of an effective restructuring plan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the authority said in a statement, clearing the so-called precautionary recapitalization of a lender that needs state help to survive even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been declared solvent by banking supervisors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will help ensure the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term viability, whilst limiting competition distortions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Rome, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist has added his voice to the cacophony of central bank policymakers offering guidance about how, and when, monetary policy might change. Peter Praet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view is that the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures are bearing fruit; but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to stop them. He says: As the economic prospects brighten, higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions increasingly attractive. This, in and of itself, will reinforce accommodation and make sure that inflation sustainably converges towards our objective of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But our mission is not yet accomplished. We need patience and persistence. We need to be patient, because inflation convergence needs more time to show through convincingly in the data. The euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic environment is improving, and the fat negative tail to inflation expectations, which was so visible at the start of our asset purchase programme, has virtually disappeared. This strengthens our confidence that headline inflation will gradually move towards the Governing Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objective. But measured inflation remains exceedingly volatile and metrics of underlying price pressures continue to be subdued. The entire distribution of inflation expectations still needs to shift a fair distance to the right. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he means: The ECB is currently holding interest rates at record lows, and buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of government and corporate bonds each month with new money. Praet signed off his speech with a strong hint that the ECB should be cautious about unwinding this huge stimulus, despite pressure from hawkish policymakers to rein things in: We need to be persistent, because the baseline scenario for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance. Alarm bells are ringing over in Athens after foreign lenders signalled Greece would not received promised bailout funds before further prior actions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or reform measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are taken. The delay in disbursement has raised anxiety as the country must begin honouring debt repayments from July 17. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to implement four reforms - one as minor as failing to name the streets where stores can remain open for Sunday trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now means that the European Stability Mechanism will put off its decision to disburse further loans to the cash-strapped country until next week. Originally disbursements worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.7bn euro were expected in early July following the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to throw Greece a new credit line of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn last month. Any move by the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund is now not expected until July 13th at the earliest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just days before debt repayments are due. The debt-stricken state owes over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn euro mostly to the European central Bank with a maturity date of July 17 for private bondholder repayments of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn. The Greek media, citing a European Commission source in Brussels, said the EU was awaiting confirmation from the IMF that the last remaining prior actions had indeed been enforced before the process could be completed. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get back to the slowdown in the UK building sector last month (see 9.36am for the data). Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says political uncertainty hurt the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading may not come as a surprise as the industry has grappled with the outcome of the general election, particularly civil engineering firms dependent on steady pipelines. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headwinds prompted by the EU referendum a year ago continue to challenge the sector. Input price inflation is still an issue and there remain concerns about how the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU will affect construction firms, given their reliance on European labour. Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Shea, partner and construction specialist at law firm Gowling WLG, agrees that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precarious grip on power is weighing on the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This data is entirely consistent with conversations we are having with construction companies across the spectrum. While house building continues to grow, there are significant issues around securing labour and the rising cost of materials. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this mid-point in the calendar year, construction firms will be taking stock of their order book for 2018. If this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in good shape - especially for those relying on major infrastructure projects - and the forecast looks less than positive, it will dampen confidence. To combat this, the government must take decisive action on such projects, including the nuclear sector. However, with the spectre of another general election still looming, there is an unhelpful amount of uncertainty in the market at present.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, fears that builders will struggle to find workers after Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Migrant workers are the lifeblood of the sector and while the plan to provide more than three million EU citizens permanent residence is a good start, the ongoing movement of labour within the bloc is still a huge issue. Its loss will have a profound impact across the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply chain and profitability, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsurprising to see construction businesses urging the government to secure a transition deal with the EU at the very least. Chris Williamson of Markit, which produced the report, flags up that confidence among builders is down -- matching a similar fall among manufacturing bosses yesterday. Takeover fever has hit the City today, as FSTE-100 listed Worldpay revealed it has received two separate approaches. Shares in Worldpay, which is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest payments processor, have soared by almost 25%. This has driven its market capitalisation up to \u00c2\u00a38bn, from \u00c2\u00a36.4bn last night. Traders scrambled to buy shares after Worldpay revealed that US firm Vantiv, and JP Morgan, had both made approaches. WorldPay was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland following its taxpayer-funded bailout. It offers credit card, online and contactless payment technologies - which are used in small firms around the UK. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Glover says the Bank of England is turning up the heat on UK lenders today: The Bank of England told U.K. banks to prove that their policies on credit cards, personal loans and other types of consumer lending won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave them weaker in a downturn. The BOE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority said on Tuesday that firms need to show that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not underestimating the risks of consumer credit given the current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153benign economic environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Tetlow argues that the Bank could have gone further.... The Bank of England stopped short of tightening consumer borrowing controls on Tuesday but ordered banks to show they are addressing concerns about the growing riskiness of their lending. Following a review of 20 lenders, the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority has raised concerns that some are being too complacent in their assessment of potential losses in their lending portfolios. Tim Wallace of the Daily Telegraph says lenders will face the consequences if they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prove that their lending isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too risky: Officials at the Bank are worried that debt is growing at an extraordinary pace, which can only be achieved if lenders are taking more and more risks and giving out loans to households that are less able to afford the burden. Ultra-low interest rates could also have lulled banks into a false sense of security, as customers can afford their debts right now but might get into trouble when rates rise. UK consumers should take heed of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns, says Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk. She predicts that lenders will now tighten their terms, meaning higher costs for borrowers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The regulators are worried we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to repay the money we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve borrowed because lenders weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t careful enough about making sure we could afford to pay them back if times get tight. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right to be concerned; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking to think some lenders may have been lax with their affordability assessments, pricing and risk profiling because this could land them and us in hot water if the economy takes a downturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a worst case scenario this could be the beginning of the end for widespread availability of very cheap loans, long term unsecured lending and lengthy 0% deals. Lenders will be left with little choice but to up their pricing and tighten their lending criteria if they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the numbers add up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mistake to leave it to lenders to stress test your income though; do it yourself so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re confident you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only borrowing money you can afford to repay now and if other bills rise or the amount you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re earning falls in the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more important than ever you apply for new credit with your eyes open. Make sure your credit report is correct and check your chance of getting accepted before you apply if you can. Go for the cheapest option and borrow the smallest amount you need for the shortest time you can.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are a few interesting charts in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement from the Bank of England. This one shows how credit card write-offs are creeping higher, but much lower than after the financial crisis broke. This shows how lenders have been offering 0% teaser rates for longer and longer, to lure customer to transfer their balances. And this one shows the explosive growth in Personal Contract Purchase plans to finance new car deals: My colleague Jill Treanor has emerged from the Bank of England, where selected media have been briefed about the consumer credit move. She writes: The Bank of England is stepping up its scrutiny of banks and other lenders on credit cards, personal loans and car purchases amid fears they are being lulled into a false sense of security by the current economic backdrop. Threadneedle Street is writing to the firms it regulates after reviewing the consumer credit sector, where lending is growing at 10.3% a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outpacing the 2.3% rise in household income. The bank is calling on firms to look at the terms under which they are granting zero-balance transfers on credit cards and the basis on which they are issuing personal loans, and to consider the impact of a fall in value of a car when providing vehicle finance. Its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, found that while the current pace of growth was not being driven by a relaxation of lending standards, it was concerned that to achieve their future plans they would have to do so... More here: Effectively, the Bank of England is firing a warning shot over the bows of the consumer credit industry today. It is demanding that all firms with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material exposures to consumer credit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd provide evidence that they are lending sensible, rather than enforcing tougher rules today. It warns them that: Firms are the first line of defence against the risk of losses on these exposures. The BoE wants to see proof that: Credit-scoring adequately captures medium-term risk, Stress-testing approaches do not under-estimate potential downturn risk, Any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloss leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 segments are explicitly reported and monitored. Consideration is given to whether, at the cut-off point for new business, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprudent add-on\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is or should be applied The Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) has been interpreted prudently in underwriting A borrower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total debt (including secured) is taken into account in the underwriting process, Firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk appetite, MI and governance frameworks are sufficient to oversee consumer credit portfolios, including controls embedded to prevent unintended drift in underwriting, overall asset quality or pricing-for-risk standards, and board oversight of this. Click here to read the full statement from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority. The Bank of England has singled out some key areas of concerns in the credit market. One is credit cards, where some lenders are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153becoming dependent on long-term 0% promotional offers (including balance transfers) to attract new balances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those deals are particularly vulnerable to economic changes, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PRA says: Where new business on 0% interest credit cards is only marginally profitable, it implies that firms will be facing losses if model assumptions turn out to be optimistic. Another is motor finance, where Personal Contract Purchase deals are increasingly popular. Under those deals, a customer can effectively lease a new car for a few years and then walk away - leaving the lender owning the vehicle. That creates a risk, if the value of the car has depreciated faster than expected. The PRA warns that: PCP creates explicit risk exposure to the vehicle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residual value for lenders, who typically offer a guaranteed future value (GFV) for the vehicle. Gross GFV exposure is estimated to be around \u00c2\u00a323 billion across the industry, and GFVs are typically set in the range of 85-95% of the vehicle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected future value (with a minority higher than that). PCPs written at the high end of this range are particularly exposed to a significant downturn in the used car market, possibly outside historic experience (used car prices fell by up to c.20% in the crisis, before recovering). An initial fall in prices could lead to a surplus of used cars coming to the market, which could further weaken prices and cause material losses to lenders through their GFV risk Newsflash: The Bank of England has launched its crackdown on risky consumer lending, by ordering British banks and other lenders to prove that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not taking too much risk. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulatory Authority is tightening thing up, following concerns that some lenders have been too gung-ho when offering credit to consumers. Lenders have been told to prove, by September, that they are adequately protected against consumer credit risks. But the BoE isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually bringing in any new rules today -- instead, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning companies that they need prove they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not exposed to too much danger. In a statement, the PRA warned that the consumer credit market appears to have deteriorated, saying: In an environment of rapid growth in consumer credit, interest margins have fallen and there was evidence of weakness in some aspects of underwriting, so lenders are more vulnerable to losses in stress. Overall, the PRA judges that the resilience of consumer credit portfolios is reducing, due to the combination of continued growth, lower pricing, falling average risk-weights (for firms using internal-ratings based models2), and some increased lending into higher-risk segments. More to follow.... Newsflash: Growth in the UK building sector slowed last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which has fallen to 54.8 in June, from 56.0 in May. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this signals that the sector cooled a little after a strong performance in May. The building firms surveyed cited \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renewed risk aversion among clients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, due to the economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty. Another worrying sign - optimism among construction companies is now the lowest since December 2016. Tim Moore of Markit says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Survey respondents commented on renewed caution among clients, in response to heightened political and economic uncertainty. Fragile business sentiment led to delayed decision-making on large projects and greater concern about the outlook for workloads during the next 12 months. While construction firms remain upbeat overall about their near-term growth prospects, the degree of confidence fell to its lowest so far this year. The pound is hovering around the $1.293 mark this morning, unchanged on the day. McCafferty and Vlieghe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divergent comments on interest rates have basically cancelled each other out. Against the euro, the pound is flat too, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.139. That means one euro is worth 87.8p. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale suspects that the pound will weaken against the euro in the months ahead: Gertjan Vlieghe makes the dovish case that hiking too soon is worse than hiking too late, Ian McCafferty is quoted on news wires restating his view that to tighten would be appropriate. Meanwhile, the slow deterioration of the economy continues against a backdrop of equally slow-moving Brexit negotiations. The road to EUR/GBP 0.90 and beyond will be rocky and slow, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on it all the same. As predicted, European stock markets have all dropped at the open. The FTSE 100 has shed 22 points, or 0.3%. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more North Korean sabre rattling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missile test. The takeover battle for UK modelmaker Hornby chugs on this morning. Hornby has slapped down a takeover offer from its own majority shareholder Phoenix Asset Management. Hornby, the firm behind Airfix planes, Scalextric cars and its eponymous trains, urged shareholders to reject Phoenix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer, as: The Hornby Directors believe that the Offer does not reflect an adequate premium for control and significantly undervalues Hornby and its prospects. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tricky situation, though. Last week, Phoenix raised its stake in Hornby over 50%, meaning it had to offer to buy the rest of the shares. Shareholders can resist, but then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck holding share in a company whose directors are at war with their largest investor.... Despite the consumer slowdown, supermarket chain Sainsbury has beaten City forecasts with its sales growth for the last three months. My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: Strong sales of fresh fruit and veg and a dash for paddling pools, summer clothes and fans helped Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Argos deliver a big jump in sales growth. Sales at stores open more than a year, excluding fuel, rose 2.3% in the 16 weeks to 1 July, up from 0.3% in the previous three months partly thanks to the warm start to the summer. Mike Coupe, group chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have delivered a strong performance, driven by our differentiated strategy, offering customers quality, value and choice across food, general merchandise, clothing and financial services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said fresh produce had performed particularly well, outperforming the market with volume growth of 1% as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut the price of summer favourites including Jersey Royal potatoes and British strawberries. That helped boost total grocery sales by 3% compared to 0.3% growth in the previous three months. Another day, another division among the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team of interest rate setters. Ian McCafferty and Gertjan Vlieghe are the latest members of the Monetary Policy Committee to give opposing views on whether or not it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to raise UK rates, currently at an all-time low of 0.25%. McCafferty, who was among three MPC members to vote for a rate rise at the June meeting, told the Daily Post in North Wales that it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prudent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd move to increase borrowing costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We made the last interest rate cut from 0.5% to 0.25% last August after the EU referendum decision when it was felt that a stimulus was needed. Since then the economy has not slowed to the extent we feared it would last summer and meanwhile inflation has been high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel on the balance of monetary policy that there is a need for change. I think this would be justified and would be the prudent thing to do at this stage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vlieghe on the other hand says it would be a mistake to raise interest rates now. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most dovish members of the MPC, and insists that it would be wrong hike borrowing costs when consumer spending is slowing. He told the Independent: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an environment where a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that turns out to be slightly late. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the consumption slowdown is here, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not over. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a sufficient offset from investment and net exports to compensate for that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I want to emphasise is that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there is no risk from keeping rates on hold. I just think that we are still in an environment where one of those risks is bigger than the other one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It all shows that the next BoE interest rate meeting, in August, could be a real clash of wills. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Consumer credit fears have been building in the UK for months. Squeezed families have been forced deeper into debt, and some borrowers have been loosening their lending criteria to keep the loans flowing. And today, the Bank of England is expected to outline how it will rein in lenders who have been doling out credit to consumers too quickly. This follows last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, which flagged up concerns that the credit market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly to buy cars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was a concern. Reuters has a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming announcement, saying: The BoE said last week that a targeted review by its banking supervisory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), had found weaknesses in some aspects of underwriting credit and a reduction in the resilience of banks. On Tuesday, the PRA will make a statement on its first set of specific actions or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the banks it regulates regarding credit to consumers. It will look at a wide range of credit, including the financing of car purchases - though banks now account for a much smaller portion of this than in the past. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks are priced and managed appropriately and benign conditions do not lead to complacency by lenders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the BoE said last week in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report. The statement is expected around 9.30am UK time. At the same time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also get a new healthcheck on the UK building sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Construction PMI is expected to drop to 55 points, to 56 in May, which would show that growth slowed in June. The report could move the markets, says David Madden of CMC Markets: Homebuilders like Persimmon, Redrow, Bovis Homes and Taylor Wimpey will also be sensitive to the UK construction data. The house builders have benefitted from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loose monetary policy, and should that policy change, we could see a reversal of fortunes for the sector. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning; not helped by the news that North Korea has just claimed to have tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Independence Day in America, so Wall Street will be closed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England publishes Financial Policy Committee meeting minutes 9.30am: UK construction PMI released 10am: Eurozone producer prices report for May",

The Governor was alerted given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost unthinkable consequences should Barings go down: not only would the failure of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the very status of London would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the City as an international financial centre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd .</p> <p>Amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the Bank of England (hereafter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), the Treasury and Downing Street, it was becoming apparent that the crisis at Barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency, and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the City.</p> <p>The Bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the Governor of the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lidderdale \u00e2\u20ac\u201c announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for Barings; within half an hour, the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top institutions rushed to contribute \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of Raphaels (\u00c2\u00a3250,000), Antony Gibbs and Brown Shipley (\u00c2\u00a3200,000 apiece) and Smith Payne &amp; Smiths, Barclays, Morgan and Hambros (each contributed \u00c2\u00a3100,000).

Some special purpose vehicles, derivatives, agency structures or collateral swaps carry material credit risk which escapes the detailed aspects of the capital framework.</li> <li><strong>Treatment of liquid assets</strong>. Firms can account for the value in their liquid assets buffer on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold to maturity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd basis. This raises the risk that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if gilt yields should rise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c market price movements in liquid assets buffers could lead to unrealised losses.</li> <li><strong>Liquidity horizon</strong>. Some banks are seeking out funding that matures just beyond the time horizon used to calculate regulatory liquidity requirements.</li> <li><strong>For insurers, the Solvency II contract boundary</strong>. Firms cannot recognise future premiums on unit-linked savings policies that do not include any insurance cover or financial guarantee of benefits. Some have sought to amend existing contracts to extend the contract boundary and recognise more future profit.</li> </ul> <p>Woods also warns that some lenders are pushing the boundaries of prudent lending, hinting that some may have crossed the line.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Across the wider market, we are observing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not from all firms, but definitely from a few (and some of them building societies) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium.</p> <p>This search for marginal borrowers is a normal function of competitive markets, and does not imply that all resulting loans will turn out to be poor quality. </p> </blockquote> <p>Woods was meant to give these comments in a speech to the Building Society Association (BSA) Annual Conference in May, but had to pull out because of general election purdah rules.</p> <p>Had Woods been been there, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have also delivered this warning....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of, or failed to control, the risks they were taking. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T12:23:01.550Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59636a32e4b0d920e0e2ac80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T12:01:10.703Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany Trade &amp; Invest</strong>, the federal economic development agency, is hanging out the bunting on the back of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures.<br></p> <p>It has sent round a press release jauntily titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<strong>German trade gets summer feeling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, </strong>arguing that<strong> </strong>the increase in German imports and exports in May shows the global economy is chugging along nicely.</p> <p><strong>Thomas Bozoyan</strong>, Senior Manager of Economic Research, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength as a manufacturing location is well-known, but the faith in that is reinforced by these export statistics.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The import statistic is perhaps more significant though, as it shows not only that German companies are manufacturing and doing good business, it is also creating wealth for its residents and increasing consumer demand.</p> <p>This increase in demand is being felt in other countries as well as Germany, a very good situation.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This all has a long-term value-creating effect for the country and will contribute to the stability of the nation and its economy, both as a residential and business location.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59636695e4b042dfbe78bc7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T11:41:31.343Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Economist has <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21724810-country-saves-too-much-and-spends-too-little-why-germanys-current-account-surplus-bad\">a good piece on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus</a> (and a rather clever front page, see below).</strong></p> <p>It explains that there are good, admirable reasons for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern competitiveness, not merely unfair tactics as some claim.</p> <p>For example:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Underlying Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive. Such moderation served Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond. It is an instinct that helps explain Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transformation since the late 1990s from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sick man to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muscle-bound champion.</p> <p>There is much to envy in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s model. Harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outperformance. Firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom. The state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired.</p> </blockquote> <p>But.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whopping surplus inevitably causes ructions elsewhere in the system, with other countries inevitably running deficits:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8% of GDP puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system. To offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon. In some countries, notably Italy, Greece and Spain, persistent deficits eventually led to crises.</p> <p>Their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost. The enduring savings glut in northern Europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful.</p> <p>In the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penchant for high saving was a stabilising force. Now it is a drag on global growth and a target for protectionists such as Mr Trump.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/went1955/status/883229581586649088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current-account surplus is bad for the world economy: it saves too much, spends too little \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Economist <a href=\"https://t.co/ObEVCXSilX\">https://t.co/ObEVCXSilX</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7TaBXdN16R\">pic.twitter.com/7TaBXdN16R</a></p>&mdash; Robert Went (@went1955) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/went1955/status/883229581586649088\">July 7, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59635d25e4b0d920e0e2ac39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-10T11:02:41.904Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"93ebee113ddbba04846f5209478195633c87c1bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93ebee113ddbba04846f5209478195633c87c1bd/0_159_2301_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A German flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"941\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Associated Press have a good quick take on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jul/10/german-trade-surplus-exports-eurozone-carillion-shares-business-live?page=with:block-596319d7e4b0e63a4a7800be#block-596319d7e4b0e63a4a7800be\">today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German trade figures,</a> for anyone just tuning in.</strong></p> <h2><strong>German exports higher in May, trade surplus widens </strong></h2> <p>German exports were up 1.4 percent in May compared with the previous month, outpacing import growth and pushing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus higher.</p> <p>The Federal Statistical Office said Monday that imports to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy were up 1.2 percent in May.

                "bodyText":"And finally, the head of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout mechanism is dropping some hints that Greece could potentially return to the financial markets. Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, says it would be wise for all involved to remember that Greece hopes to finance itself once its bailout ends. But speaking after the eurogroup meeting wrapped up in Brussels, Regling also warned Athens that investors will need confidence that it is sticking to its economic reforms. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. GW After a less than riveting session, European stock markets closed a little higher tonight. In London the FTSE 100 ended 19 points higher at 7370. The smaller FTSE 250 finished in the red, though, dragged down by poor old Carillion (which lost 40% after that dire profits warning). The German DAX closed almost 0.5% higher, thanks to those trade surplus figures, while the French, Spanish and Italian markets also gained ground. Back in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been sounding a triumphant note at the victory the country has secured in its battle to ensure that feta is sold as a purely Greek product Under the Economic Partnership Agreement the EU has signed with Japan, production of the white briny curd like cheese has been included in the 205 protected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geographical indications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, meaning only feta from Greece will now be sold under that name. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whoever negotiates with a plan, achieves his goals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the leftist leader said after holding talks with the national economy and development minister Dimitris Papadimitriou and the Agriculture and Food Minister Vangelis Apostolou. Newsflash from Brussels: the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout vehicle has finally disbursed Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited loan tranche. That facility, worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.7bn, is needed by Athens to repay earlier borrowings that mature this summer. But as Helena Smith reports, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually attending today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group meeting .... She writes: Tongues are wagging in Athens at the rare sight of a euro group starting without a Greek finance minister attending. Never mind that it is one hundred plus euro groups into the Greek crisis, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is being noticed precisely because Euclid Tsakalotos, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, will not be attending. Instead it is George Chouliarakis, the Greek minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy, who has shown up for the meeting. Tsakalotos is said to have come down with a painful ear infection. But there is talk that the Oxford-educated economics professor may also have decided to stay away because Greece, for once, is not on the agenda. After year of waiting for a long-stalled compliance review to be completed, the debt-stricken country just received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.7bn today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first instalment of a third tranche of financial assistance approved by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) on Friday. What comes in, of course, will go straight out with \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.9bn being used for debt serving needs and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.8bn for arrears clearance. Athens will receive a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subject to Greece making significant progress on arrears clearance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by September 1st bringing the total amount of assistance the nation has received from the ESM to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac181.2bn. Time for a quick summary: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has widened to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22bn in May, thanks to a jump in exports. Some experts say the figures will cause fresh tensions with the US government, given Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trenchant criticism of German trade policy. But German analysts pointed out that imports and exports have both risen this year; proof that the world economy was in decent shape. So far this year, German has grown its exports by 7.2%, and its imports by 10.3% (here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full chart) Eurozone investor confidence remains solid, according to the Sentix research group. However, worries over central banks are building, as policymakers prepare to unwind their stimulus programmes. Speaking of central banks.....The Bank of England has warned lender not to repeat the mistakes that led to the financial crisis in 2008. Deputy governor Sam Woods flagged up several areas of concern, as he urges banks, building societies and insurers to respect the spirit of the rules. Travelling by train in Britain could be stressful next month; UK commuters have been warned to expect serious disruption in August, due to a massive rail improvement programme. And the value of British infrastructure and construction firm Carillion has plunged by a third, after a shock profits warning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a desperately quiet day in the markets. Wall Street just opened flat, matching the UK FTSE 100 which is now up just 10 points. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2873 (down 0.1%), in rather subdued summer trading. Railway commuters, take a deep breath. Britain is facing an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summer of disruption on its rail network, with major delays expected on key lines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all because Network Rail is planning a massive engineering works programme, that will leave some passengers queuing just to get into their station. London commuters will be particularly badly affected; Waterloo will be half-closed for three weeks, while 26-27 August will see the biggest bank holiday engineering work ever. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: The worst of the disruption will be felt by passengers using Waterloo, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busiest station, which will see about half its platforms closed for more than three weeks from 5 August, meaning many South West trains will not run. Passengers have been warned to expect queues of up to half an hour just to enter suburban stations on the network, such as Wimbledon and Surbiton, during summer rush hours. Euston will close entirely on the 26-27 August bank holiday weekend, affecting some services on the West Coast main line to Birmingham and cities north to Glasgow. London Bridge and Charing Cross will be closed to Southeastern services for a week from the same weekend. London Paddington and Liverpool Street will also be affected, with only King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cross St Pancras, Victoria and Marylebone operating normally in the capital, although all are expected to be busier than usual to accommodate alternative journeys. Network Rail says the work will help deliver much-needed capacity; but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a painful time for passengers....

Sign up here. The Bank of England is also concerned that lenders are offering longer and longer mortgages. Deputy governor Sam Woods warns that some borrowers could find themselves still paying off their debts when they reach retirement. He says: I would highlight a recent trend in increasing loan terms: where 25 years might once have been the normal maximum term for a mortgage, now 35 years or even longer seems to be increasingly common. Of course, increasing the term reduces the level of each monthly instalment and makes the loan more affordable in the short term; however, it also increases the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan quite significantly, and it increases the possibility that the final instalments may have to be met from post-retirement income. That should not be a problem if lenders can be confident about the availability of such retirement income, or about the scope for the borrower to downsize and use the sale proceeds to pay off the balance of the loan. But if lenders become too narrowly pre-occupied with the profile of the loan in the first 5 years (in line with MMR [mortgage market review] affordability rules), this could store up a problem for the future. Sam Woods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 speech also includes a brief history of the Barings crisis of 1890, when the prestigious City institution found itself dangerously exposed to losses in Argentina. Deputy governor Woods (whose first job involved calculating Nick Leeson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses a century later) explains how Barings came unstuck when Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government started withdrawing funds. Fortunately for Barings, the City rallied round, but it highlighted the challenge of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s light-touch approach to regulating the sector, as Woods explains: Rumours began to circulate that the firm might not have any surplus left after payment of its liabilities. The Governor was alerted given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost unthinkable consequences should Barings go down: not only would the failure of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading accepting house inevitably bring down a host of other firms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the very status of London would be threatened and thus the pre-eminence of the City as an international financial centre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . Amidst much to-ing and fro-ing between the Bank of England (hereafter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), the Treasury and Downing Street, it was becoming apparent that the crisis at Barings was one not only of liquidity but also of solvency, and that there was now a palpable loss of confidence in the institution throughout the City. The Bank alone could not afford to act as lender of last resort so eventually the Governor of the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lidderdale \u00e2\u20ac\u201c announced the establishment of a guarantee fund for Barings; within half an hour, the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top institutions rushed to contribute \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of Raphaels (\u00c2\u00a3250,000), Antony Gibbs and Brown Shipley (\u00c2\u00a3200,000 apiece) and Smith Payne &amp; Smiths, Barclays, Morgan and Hambros (each contributed \u00c2\u00a3100,000). Indeed, the leading joint-stock banks had put themselves down for \u00c2\u00a33.25m and by mid-afternoon the fund was up to \u00c2\u00a310m and climbed further to \u00c2\u00a317m by the following week Barings was saved. But the crisis revealed something about the relationship between the state and industry at the end of the nineteenth century. Indeed, the institutional set-up explains quite a lot about the approach taken towards the oversight of financial institutions at this time.... The full speech is on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, here: One of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top policymakers has fired a warning shot at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders not to take undue risks. Sam Woods, the Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation, has urged banks, building societies and insurers to stick to the spirit of financial regulation, as well as the letter. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that the BoE is concerned that credit is being doled out in a dangerous way, just as real wages fall and consumers are squeezed. Woods is concerned that some are indulging in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pure regulatory arbitrage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- using questionable measures that make them look more secure. In particular, he highlights four ways that lenders could pull the wool over the regulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes: Off-balance sheet leverage. Some special purpose vehicles, derivatives, agency structures or collateral swaps carry material credit risk which escapes the detailed aspects of the capital framework. Treatment of liquid assets. Firms can account for the value in their liquid assets buffer on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold to maturity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd basis. This raises the risk that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if gilt yields should rise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c market price movements in liquid assets buffers could lead to unrealised losses. Liquidity horizon. Some banks are seeking out funding that matures just beyond the time horizon used to calculate regulatory liquidity requirements. For insurers, the Solvency II contract boundary. Firms cannot recognise future premiums on unit-linked savings policies that do not include any insurance cover or financial guarantee of benefits. Some have sought to amend existing contracts to extend the contract boundary and recognise more future profit. Woods also warns that some lenders are pushing the boundaries of prudent lending, hinting that some may have crossed the line. He says: Across the wider market, we are observing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not from all firms, but definitely from a few (and some of them building societies) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in credit risk appetite as lenders compete with each other to find ways of widening the pool of available borrowers, increasing the size of loans available to them, or reducing the credit premium. This search for marginal borrowers is a normal function of competitive markets, and does not imply that all resulting loans will turn out to be poor quality. Woods was meant to give these comments in a speech to the Building Society Association (BSA) Annual Conference in May, but had to pull out because of general election purdah rules. Had Woods been been there, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have also delivered this warning.... That part of the reason why only 44 societies are attending this conference rather than the 60+ that came to its equivalent in 2004 lies in the fact that many of those societies were unaware of, or failed to control, the risks they were taking. Germany Trade &amp; Invest, the federal economic development agency, is hanging out the bunting on the back of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures. It has sent round a press release jauntily titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153German trade gets summer feeling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, arguing that the increase in German imports and exports in May shows the global economy is chugging along nicely. Thomas Bozoyan, Senior Manager of Economic Research, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength as a manufacturing location is well-known, but the faith in that is reinforced by these export statistics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The import statistic is perhaps more significant though, as it shows not only that German companies are manufacturing and doing good business, it is also creating wealth for its residents and increasing consumer demand. This increase in demand is being felt in other countries as well as Germany, a very good situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This all has a long-term value-creating effect for the country and will contribute to the stability of the nation and its economy, both as a residential and business location.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Economist has a good piece on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus (and a rather clever front page, see below). It explains that there are good, admirable reasons for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern competitiveness, not merely unfair tactics as some claim. For example: Underlying Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus is a decades-old accord between business and unions in favour of wage restraint to keep export industries competitive. Such moderation served Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export-led economy well through its postwar recovery and beyond. It is an instinct that helps explain Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transformation since the late 1990s from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sick man to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muscle-bound champion. There is much to envy in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s model. Harmony between firms and workers has been one of the main reasons for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outperformance. Firms could invest free from the worry that unions would hold them to ransom. The state played its part by sponsoring a system of vocational training that is rightly admired. But.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whopping surplus inevitably causes ructions elsewhere in the system, with other countries inevitably running deficits: For a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8% of GDP puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system. To offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon. In some countries, notably Italy, Greece and Spain, persistent deficits eventually led to crises. Their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost. The enduring savings glut in northern Europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful. In the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penchant for high saving was a stabilising force. Now it is a drag on global growth and a target for protectionists such as Mr Trump. Associated Press have a good quick take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German trade figures, for anyone just tuning in. German exports higher in May, trade surplus widens German exports were up 1.4 percent in May compared with the previous month, outpacing import growth and pushing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus higher. The Federal Statistical Office said Monday that imports to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy were up 1.2 percent in May. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus was up to 20.3 billion euros ($23.1 billion), from 19.8 billion euros in April. The figures follow data last week showing that factory orders and industrial production both increased in May. ING-DiBa economist Carsten Brzeski said that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong domestic demand has already been around for a long while but the former growth engines, industrial production and exports have also started to gain momentum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he cautioned that the increasing value of the euro could affect German exports in the coming months. Overnight, credit card firm Visa has provided fresh evidence that UK households are being squeezed by rising inflation. Visa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconsumer spending index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fell by 0.3% between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2013, indicating that shoppers are cutting back now that inflation (2.9% in June) is rising rather faster than pay rises (2.1% in the March-May quarter). Data firm Markit shows how spending has fallen sharply in the last few months: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Back in the City, shares in infrastructure and construction firm Carillion have slumped by a third to their lowest in over 13 years. Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged after the company announced that results would be below expectations, and that CEO Richard Howson was stepping down. Carillion has suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deterioration in cash flows on a select number of construction contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, forcing it to take a provision of \u00c2\u00a3845m against likely losses. It is now pulling out of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt - and will only undertake future construction work \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on a highly selective basis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company appears to have suffered badly from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, as my colleague Julia Kollewe explains: In December, the Wolverhampton-based company, which employs nearly 50,000 people in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, blamed upheaval in Whitehall departments after the Brexit vote and change of government for a slowdown in orders. Carillion has also been affected by cuts in spending by governments in the Middle East prompted by low oil prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story. Over to Greece.... and new figures show that industrial output jumped by 5.4% year-on-year in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better than April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.9% annual rise, and may indicate that the Greek economy has turned a corner. Separately, the inflation rate in Greece has fallen to 0.9% in June, down from 1.5% in May (on an EU-harmonised basis). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly due to a drop in costs for household equipment and health services, according to Elstat. Investor confidence across the euro area has dipped very slightly this month, and central bankers are to blame. Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey of investor morale has dipped to 28.3 this month, down from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28.4. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a fairly high level, reflecting the strong economic data we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen from the eurozone in recent months. But.... there are also signs that the prospect of higher interest rates and the unwinding of central bank stimulus programmes are worrying investors. Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Central Bank Policy index has slumped to -26 in July, down from -11.5 in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the measure was created in 2005. Sentix blames recent hints by the European Central Bank that it is moving towards unwinding its bond-buying programme, given the recovery in inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a few months now, it has been clear to investors that the ECB must leave its expansive course. This expectation has intensified for investors over the past few weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart, showing how German imports and exports have both accelerated this year. It also backs up Claus Vistesen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point about how imports have actually grown faster than exports since the start of the year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures are the latest in a series of strong German data. Last Thursday, we learned that factory orders rose by 1% in May, suggesting that economic growth was solid. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: German Trade data proved to be much stronger than expected...echoing the strong foreign orders seen last week, though this will inevitably only serve to exacerbate tensions with the US, and some European countries. The DAX index of leading German companies has jumped by 0.5% this morning, as traders in Frankfurt welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures. Exporters such as industrial group Thyssenkrupp, carmaker BMW and tire producer Continental are all among the top risers. Other European markets are also up in early trading: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics argues that the media are obsessing with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus. He points out that imports have actually risen faster than exports in recent months - perhaps a sign that German consumption is picking up. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets is impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade report Thomas Gitzel, VP Bank economist, says Germany is benefitted from a pick-up in global demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The global economy is improving, which has a positive impact on the German export economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gitzel also expects fresh criticism from the White House, which has accused Germany of exploiting an unfairly weak currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trade balance is currently swelling, which will again lead to suspicions on the other side of the Atlantic. U.S. President Donald Trump will therefore continue his vehement criticism of the high German trade surplus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mehreen Khan of the Financial Times agrees that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22bn trade surplus, and its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.3bn current account surplus, will rile the US government: The size of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twin surpluses has come in for criticism from the Trump administration, which has accused Berlin of exploiting an undervalued currency. The likes of the EU and the International Monetary Fund have also urged the German government to make the most of its healthy public finances and spend more money in the domestic economy. Germany ran a small deficit on services, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn, during May. However, this was more than covered by the surplus of goods flowing from German factories to other countries. Destatis says that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account surplus remained buoyant: According to provisional results of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the current account of the balance of payments showed a surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.3bn in May 2017, which takes into account the balances of trade in goods including supplementary trade items (+\u00e2\u201a\u00ac24.4bn), services (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.0bn), primary income (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.6bn) and secondary income (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn). In May 2016, the German current account recorded a surplus of 17.9 billion euros. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Germany ran a trade surplus with its fellow European Union states, and also with the rest of the world. Here are the details: EU: German exported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac64.2bn of goods, and imported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac57.8bn The eurozone: German exported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40.8bn of goods, and imported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac39.1bn Non-EU members: Germany exported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.5bn, and imported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18.7bn Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has got the new week up and running by smashing City expectations for its trade figures. German exports jumped by 1.4% month-on-month in May, outstripping a 1.2% rise in imports. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fifth monthly rise in exports in a row, meaning Germany achieved a seasonally adjusted foreign trade balance of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.3bn. Both figures were stronger than expected; a Reuters poll had predicted exports would rise by just 0.3%, and imports by 0.5%. On an annual basis, the figures are even more impressive. Germany exported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac110.6bn worth of goods in May, a surge of 14.1% year-on year. Imports swelled by 16.2% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac88.6bn. That drove the German trade surplus up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22.0bn in May 2017, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.7bn in May 2016. In contrast, Britain posted a trade deficit of \u00c2\u00a33.1bn during the month. The figures highlight that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy remains in rude health, and well placed to handle Brexit-related disruption. Over the weekend, German industry bodies warned that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help Britain get a good exit deal But they will also intensify criticism that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export muscle is destabilising the eurozone, effectively forcing its neighbours to run trade deficits Last week, the International Monetary Fund urged Berlin to cut its current account surplus by boosting investment spending, which would also suck more imports into Germany and tackle the trade surplus. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction shortly... Also coming up today European financial markets are expected to rise at the start of the week. Traders are in upbeat mood, after last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US jobs figures. However, UK construction and services support firm Carillion has surprise the City with a profits warning, so that might dent the mood a little (more on that shortly too...) We get a new gauge on investor confidence across the eurozone, from German market research firm Sentix, plus a new Greek inflation report. And eurozone finance ministers will be holding a eurogroup meeting in Brussels. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing eurozone banking, national insolvency rules, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-bailout future, and the euro area fiscal stance for 2018 .

But the Phillips curve now appears remarkably flat, with regular pay growth still subdued at 2% despite some pick-up from last month. Including bonuses, average earnings growth actually fell back to 1.8%.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence, real earnings growth remains deep in negative territory and this seems unlikely to change anytime soon. This will dampen consumer spending power, though the continued strength of the jobs market should prevent the recent slowdown in the economy turning into a recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>A quick explanation:</strong> the Phillips Curve argues that there is an inverse relationship between joblessness and wage inflation. So if unemployment rises, pay will drop and vice versa.</p> <p>However in the UK, and many other advance economies, unemployment has fallen sharply but earnings have not pushed higher. </p> <p>Some economists suggest the Phillips Curve is flatter than expected. Others argue that something has fundamentally changed; perhaps the erosion of union power? Or increased use of robotics (artificial intelligence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t demand a pay rise)? Or perhaps weak productivity means bosses simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay more?....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IFM_Economist/status/884200532742504448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Phillips curve is broken globally &amp; Australia is no different.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yield many fireworks. The Fed chair told the House Financial Committee that she was determined to serve our her term but hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought about a second one (Donald Trump has hinted that he might replace Yellen). She repeated some comments from her prepared testimony, such that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew normal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on neutral interest rates is probably lower than in the past. Yellen also put her finger on another important issue - that wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising as fast as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. She suggests low productivity is one factor. She wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be lured into whether the markets are in a bubble right now, beyond pointing out that valuations are at the top of historical ranges. And she did get one cheeky shot in. When asked about the $19 trillion US debt mountain (displayed on a wall behind her), the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker reminded her inquisitors that this is a government matter.... As she put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe a key thing that Congress should be taking into account in designing fiscal policy is the need to achieve sustainability in the debt path over time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And on that note, goodnight! GW Janet Yellen has lessened expectations of a steep ascent of US rates, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to new alltime highs. Joshua Mahony of IG says the Fed chair has cheered investors: Stocks are back in the swing of things, with the Dow hitting new record highs in the wake of a dovish testimony from Janet Yellen in Washington. To some extent Yellen provided a relatively hawkish statement given her declaration that rate hikes should continue despite falling inflation. However, in speculating that it would not take many more hikes for the Fed funds rate to be neutral, Yellen has essentially signalled that there will be a finite amount of rate rises around the corner. Markets are now looking for a December rate hike at the earliest, and crucially just one rate rise in 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Angela Monaghan on the main story of the morning, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report: UK consumers are suffering a sustained fall in living standards as real pay fell again in the three months to May, piling more pressure on cash-strapped households. Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.5% year on year over the period, shrinking family incomes and signalling a weaker outlook for consumer spending. It followed a 0.6% drop in real pay in the three months to April, and a 0.4% fall in the previous three months, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Real pay fell despite a surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 4.6% to 4.5%, which was the lowest since May to July 1975. The employment rate rose to 74.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, said the government must intervene to address the pay squeeze. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Three months of falling pay is three months too many. The clock is ticking while workers wait for the government to act,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers must set out a plan to get real wages rising across the public and the private sectors. They should start by scrapping the unfair pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And the minimum wage must be raised to \u00c2\u00a310 as quickly as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... More here: The Canadian dollar is rallying on the back of the rate hike..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike was generally expected, and is another sign that central bankers are moving towards normalising monetary policy. In a statement the Bank of Canada says growth is strengthening across the economy and becoming more sustainable. The BoC adds: Recent data have bolstered the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in its outlook for above-potential growth and the absorption of excess capacity in the economy. The Bank acknowledges recent softness in inflation but judges this to be temporary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: Canadian interest rates have been hiked for the first time in seven years. The Bank of Canada has voted to raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point, from 0.5% to 0.75%. The markets often get excited when a central banker hits the headlines. And on this occasion, Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics reckons they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got over-excited by Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He tweets: Up she goes... Shares are rallying in New York at the start of trading, as Wall Street absorbs Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress. The Dow gained almost 100 points at the start of trading, and is getting very close to its previous record closing high. Traders seem to be encouraged by Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat comments about the US recovery, and her caution on inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been seen as a signal that the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike borrowing costs too aggressively, especially as Yellen says rate rises will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. European markets are also getting a boost, with the FTSE 100 now up 80 points at 7410. Capital Economics argus that Yellen hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really said anything very new: Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared remarks, released ahead of her semi-annual testimony today, offered no new insights on the timing of either the next hike in interest rates or when balance sheet normalisation would begin. This is not a complete surprise, however, since it is still too early for the Fed to tip its hand on what it will do at September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting. It makes a lot more sense to wait and absorb another couple of months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of data, before providing a stronger steer to the markets around the time of the Jackson Hole conference. But sometimes, no news is good news.... so bonds, commodities and emerging market currencies are also having a better day as the dollar dips. The US dollar has dropped after Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony hit the wires. Traders seem to be focusing on the Fed Chair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious comments about inflation, and the fact she highlighted it is below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of around 2%. That could be seen as a hint that interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise as quickly as the markets had expected (reminder, the last hike was in June). Newsflash: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker, Janet Yellen of the Federal Reserve, has just released her testimony to the US Congress. In it, Yellen says that the US labour market has continued to recover since her last testimony, in February. The economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace, on average, so far this year, she adds. And that means that interest rates will probably keep rising. As Yellen puts it: The Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and stable prices. However, the Fed chair also emphasis that inflation is below target. She singles it out as a particular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that could affect monetary policy. She says: Inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective and has declined recently; the Committee will be monitoring inflation developments closely in the months ahead. Breaking! Royal Bank of Scotland is paying over \u00c2\u00a34bn to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Housing Finance Agency to resolve long-running inquiry. It relates to the misselling of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis (before RBS almost collapsed, and was bailed out by the taxpayer). Ross McEwan, RBS CEO, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters facing RBS and is further evidence of the determination of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership to put our remaining issues behind us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This settlement is a stark reminder of what happened to this bank before the financial crisis, and the heavy price paid for its pursuit of global ambitions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That price may not be fully paid, yet, as RBS is still co-operating with a separate investigation involving the Department of Justice. Over in Greece, the prospect that the debt-stricken country could return to the financial markets soon has dominated the news. Now, in exclusive comments to our correspondent, the Greek minister of state and government spokesman has confirmed that accessing markets remains a priority even if senior bank officials have described the move as premature. Helena Smith reports from Athens Hopes of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imminent return to markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bellwether of economic recovery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appeared to be dashed last night when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banker, Yiannis Stournaras, pronounced that he thought the move to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit early.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the absence of reaction by markets to Stournaras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments has prompted speculation that a foray may be on the cards - sooner rather than later. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout programme expires in August 2018, and as Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told the Guardian, the aim is to be fully prepared to tap markets by that date. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to prepare the ground with test exits [until 2018] in order to be able at the end of the programme to finance our debt without official sector support,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that, we are considering all possible scenarios regarding optimum timing for the first issuance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got fresh evidence that the European recovery is strengthening. Eurozone industrial production rose by 4% year-on-year in May, new figures from Eurostat show. Germany, France, Italy and Spain all reported strong figures, indicating that demand is picking up. Kathleen Brooks of City Index sees signs of hope for workers in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged by that weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose to 2% per year from 1.8%, and that the number of new jobs created also rose. Even with the pick-up in wage growth in May, the consumer remains constrained, as CPI is running at 2.9%, however, things could start to get easier for UK households as we will explain. Chart 1 below shows UK 3-month jobs growth and UK ex. Bonus wage data over five years. As you can see, there is no real link between UK job creation and wage data, with the two often moving in opposite directions. However, the recent uptick in wages has corresponded with an uptick in job creation, after the two moved in opposing directions, as you can see marked in the chart. Wages tend to lag job growth, however, as job growth continues to pick up from the lows reached in Q3 last year, perhaps now is the time for wages to rise..... The opposition Labour party says it would battle the wage freeze by raising the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minimum wage to \u00c2\u00a310 per hour, from \u00c2\u00a37.20 today. Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the overall increase in employment, but are deeply concerned that millions have faced a real terms pay cut under this Government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost of basic essentials continues to rise as real wages decline under the Conservatives. Millions are struggling to get by while Theresa May hands \u00c2\u00a31 billion to the DUP to keep herself in a job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too many people also continue to face barriers to getting a job on the basis of their age, ethnicity, disability or where they live. These same groups bear the brunt of this Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed austerity plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Labour government will implement a real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour, and bring an immediate end to Tory austerity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at Liverpool University, has interrogated the data, and reports: The Bank of England historical database, which reports unemployment rate data since 1856 is telling us that the unemployment rate has been below 4.5% 43%(!!!) of the times. Since 1856, real average wage growth has been 1.54% and during this period, it has been negative only 22% of the times. So in a historical context, we are currently doing very poorly in terms of real wage growth and reasonably (but not exceptionally) well in terms of the unemployment rate! As this graph shows, the number of people working in the UK has risen pretty steadily since the recession ended in 2009. Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), is deeply concerned by the drop in real wages \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment has climbed ever higher and it is encouraging to see more people in work. Yet the number of people struggling to make ends meet despite being in work has also increased. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real wages have seen an alarming slide. This is the third month in a row that real earnings have fallen. In real terms earnings are no better than they were 12 years ago: total pay in real terms is the same as it was in August 2005. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With benefits and tax credits frozen, there is little respite for families just about managing. Some 3.8 million workers are trapped in poverty, many with few qualifications and precious little opportunity to retrain. The minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, has welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report. He point out that more people are in work than at any time since 1971, when records began. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These latest statistics are another reminder that our strong economy is giving record numbers of people the chance to find and stay in work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment is low, employment is high and there are over three quarters of a million vacancies. This is great news for Britain and for millions of ordinary working families. The real wage squeeze makes it hard for the Bank of England to raise interest rates soon, argues Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management. Policy makers at the Bank of England are faced with a puzzling shift in the relationship between unemployment and wages. Growth in core average earnings (excluding bonuses), did improve but only marginally, and was up just 2% compared with a year earlier. Inflation is now above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target level and real earnings growth has slipped into negative territory. This is having a negative impact on household spending. With uncertainty gathering over the Brexit negotiations, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee would need to see a distinct improvement in earnings growth towards 3% and above, to be in a position to raise interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, is encouraged that UK employment has hit a fresh record high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The great UK jobs creating machine has kicked into gear again, with employment growth accelerating in recent months after slower growth in late 2016. The employment rate is now within touching distance of 75% for the first time ever, while the unemployment rate fell further to 4.5%. But Hawksworth also fears that real wages will not start rising again for some months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the 1970s or 1980s such low unemployment, combined with inflation rising towards 3%, could have set off a wage-price spiral. But the Phillips curve now appears remarkably flat, with regular pay growth still subdued at 2% despite some pick-up from last month. Including bonuses, average earnings growth actually fell back to 1.8%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence, real earnings growth remains deep in negative territory and this seems unlikely to change anytime soon. This will dampen consumer spending power, though the continued strength of the jobs market should prevent the recent slowdown in the economy turning into a recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A quick explanation: the Phillips Curve argues that there is an inverse relationship between joblessness and wage inflation. So if unemployment rises, pay will drop and vice versa. However in the UK, and many other advance economies, unemployment has fallen sharply but earnings have not pushed higher. Some economists suggest the Phillips Curve is flatter than expected. Others argue that something has fundamentally changed; perhaps the erosion of union power? Or increased use of robotics (artificial intelligence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t demand a pay rise)? Or perhaps weak productivity means bosses simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay more?.... Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University and Research Director at the Work Foundation, says the drop in total pay is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a source of concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Including bonuses, the preferred three month average figure for the growth in average weekly earnings slipped down to 1.8% in May, compared with 2.1% in April. This figure is now 2% or lower in all sectors except for distribution and hospitality. The less reliable single month figure for the whole economy also now stands at 1.8%. Professor Johnes also points out that the number of vacancies has fallen slightly in the last couple of months (but remains high). There has been a sharp decline in vacancies in the real estate sector over the most recent quarter, possibly reflecting the slowdown in the housing market. This latest fall in real wages is likely to drag on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth this year, Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Shrinking real pay doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well for economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer and falling real incomes should eventually translate into lower retail sales. Respected think-tank NIESR said last week it expects relatively anaemic growth of 0.3% in the second quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c barely higher than the disappointing 0.2% registered in Q1. Brettell also points out that the classic idea that workers get paid more when labour is in short supply seems to have broken down. The UK labour market is becoming increasingly difficult to interpret. Conventional economic theory suggests that low unemployment should ultimately lead to upward pressure on wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there has been scant evidence of this during the latest squeeze on household finances. Perhaps workers simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the bargaining power they once did. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy needs higher wages to keep consumer spending up, and protect the economy from Brexit uncertainty. So argues Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First. Real wage gains are the silver bullet for the concerns that swamp the UK economy at the moment; they come from optimistic employers happy with business conditions (which we do not have), they allow consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake (which we urgently need) and promote growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy (which is an argument that desperately needs clarity but yet there is little to be found).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows the regional differences in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market. Employment levels are highest in the South West of England, and the lowest in Northern Ireland. ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes says the UK employment market looks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, apart from the drop in real wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The general picture is little changed on last month, with the overall employment rate and that for women both at record highs, the inactivity rate at a joint record low and the unemployment rate falling to its lowest since early summer 1975. Despite the strong jobs picture, however, there has been another real-terms fall in total earnings, with the growth in weekly wages low and inflation still rising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has some interesting thoughts on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report: This chart, from Jamie McGeever at Reuters, shows how rising inflation has driven real wages down: Bad news for workers; wages are still not keeping up with inflation. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in nominal terms (that is, not adjusted for price inflation) increased by 1.8% including bonuses in the March-May quarter. Basic pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.0% year-on-year. Inflation jumped by 2.9% in May, so these figures confirm that earnings are falling in real terms. The number of people in work rose by 175,000 during the last quarter, taking the employment total above 32 million. The ONS says: There were 32.01 million people in work, 175,000 more than for December 2016 to February 2017 and 324,000 more than for a year earlier. The chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has now dropped to the lowest level since Harold Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final term in Downing Street: Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5% in the three months to May, a new 42-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 4.6% a month ago, and is the lowest rate since 1975. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of people out of work fell by 64,000 during the March-to-May quarter. That takes the total number of people out of work down to 1.495 million. The employment rate has hit a record high, at 75.9%..... More to follow! The drop in the pound is pushing shares in exporters higher in London. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 52 points to 7381, up 0.7% today. Fashion chain Burberry is the top riser, up 3.2%, after reporting a 3% jump in underlying retail revenue growth in the last quarter. Burberry credited better stronger sales in mainland China, and in the UK, for the pick-up in sales. Steve Clayton, fund manager of Hargreaves Lansdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Select UK Growth Shares fund, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging performance. The company say they are seeing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top customers returning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. to their stores. In other words, the Chinese are spending again. We have bad news for any Brits heading over the channel this summer holidays. The pound has hit its lowest level against the euro since November 2016, following Ben Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish comments. Sterling has weakened to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1187, which means one euro is worth 89.4p. As this chart shows, the pound was worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.30 before last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Lee Hardman, an analyst with MUFG in London, agrees that an August rate rise now looks less likely, which is why sterling has fallen. He says (via Reuters) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[The pound] is definitely trading on a softer footing after this news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For anyone who had any expectation of an August hike - that is clearly looking very unrealistic now, although he does reinforce that they are moving towards a hike. That will help keep alive expectations for a move later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has fallen to a two-week low after Ben Broadbent revealed he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready to vote for a rate hike. Sterling shed 0.2% to hit $1.2821, its lowest level since late June, as the prospects of a rate rise in August receded. Philip Shaw of Investec reckons the BoE is now certain to leave interest rates on hold at their current record low, at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early drama in the markets today, as Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent declares that he is not ready to vote to raise interest rates. Speaking to the Press and Journal in Aberdeen, Broadbent declared that there are too many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imponderables\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the state of the UK economy. And that makes it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the monetary policy committee to judge if business confidence is strong enough to support higher borrowing costs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the report: Highlighting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mood of business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the key factor in his thinking, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you look at the past six to 12 months, economic growth has been okay and the employment rate good. Unemployment has drifted down a little \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and inflation is higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is reason to see the committee moving in that direction (higher interest rates) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there are still a lot of imponderables.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. At least two Bank of England policymakers are likely to vote for a rate hike in August, so Broadbent is seen as one of the centrist voices who could swing the decision. As Broadbent puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my opinion, it is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision (to raise rates). I am not ready to do it yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a scoop for the P&amp;J. The City had expected Broadbent to declare his hand yesterday, when he gave a speech in Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil capital. Instead, he avoided monetary policy issues, sticking to trade issues - and warning that Britain would suffer badly if trade with the EU was materially affected by Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze could worsen today when the latest unemployment statistics are released. City economists fear that wage growth slowed again in the last quarter, to just 1.8% in the three months to May. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, that means real wages are shrinking at a faster pace (as inflation hit 2.9% in May), meaning many households will find it even harder to make ends meet. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: The real inflation story in the UK is not the recent pickup in headline CPI inflation, but the failure of earnings growth to follow. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market data will likely see headline earnings growth fall well below 2% y/y, leaving wage growth more than 1% point below CPI inflation. Economists also expect that the UK unemployment rate will remain at 4.6% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest in over four decades, with an extra 120,000 people joining the labour force. That sounds like a strong labour market; but it simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeding through to pay packets. Overnight, ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will lose momentum this year amid squeezed living standards and uncertainty over Brexit. There could be excitement in Canada too. The Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates today, for the first time in seven years. And Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to the House Financial Services Committee, on the state of the US economy. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to stick to her position that the US economy is recovering, having raised interest rates last month. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK unemployment data 10am BST: Eurozone industrial production for May 1.30pm BST: Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement to the House Financial Services Committee 3pm BST: Bank of Canada interest rate decision 3pm BST: Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony begins",

                "bodyText":"Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OBR report shows the shortcomings in government policy since 2010: He writes: It was one of George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most effective soundbites. Before, during and after the 2010 general election, the man who served as David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor for six years blamed his austerity measures on Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix the roof while the sun was shining\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What goes around comes around. The Office for Budget Responsibility was set up by Osborne in 2010 to keep tabs on the state of the public finances free from the clutches of politicians and has now published its first report into the long-term fiscal risks facing Britain. Its message was brutally simple. The UK has had a recession once in every decade since the 1970s and there is a 50% chance of there being another one in the next five years. Recessions play havoc with the public finances: three of those since the 1970s have seen the budget deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the difference between what the government spends and its income in any one year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rise to 6% or more..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full analysis: If you missed this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the UK credit market, then catch up here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal warnings, for anyone just tuning in: UK public finances face twin threat from Brexit and downturn, says OBR Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances are in worse shape to withstand a recession than they were on the eve of the financial crash a decade ago and face the twin threat of a fresh downturn and Brexit, the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said another recession was inevitable at some point and that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to win a parliamentary majority in last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election had left the public finances more vulnerable to being blown off course than they were in 2007. In its first in-depth analysis of the fiscal risks facing Britain, the OBR said its main message was clear: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and plan accordingly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The OBR said the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit divorce bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently a matter of dispute between London and Brussels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would have little impact on the public finances. But it noted that even a small fall in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying growth rate after departure from the EU would lead to a big increase in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OBR said. The OBR noted that Brexit was not the only threat to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim of eliminating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. It said a hung parliament and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity fatigue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, alongside longer-term developments such as a rapidly ageing population, were also factors putting upward pressure on the deficit... More here: In other news.... the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has fallen, for the first time in a month. The initial jobless claims fell to 247,000 last week, from 250,000. That suggests the US labo(u)r market is still pretty robust. You can read the full OBR report yourself, here. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has failed a fiscal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstress test\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 created to see how it would cope with a new financial crisis. The test, published in the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal report today, models the impact of a deep recession, a tumbling stock market and a sterling crisis, which creates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lasting effects on potential output\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the bad news is that Britain would suffer \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsevere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fiscal effects: The deficit would rise to 8.1% of GDP by 2021-22 (of which 7.4% would be structural, and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be grown away) The national debt would rise to 114% of GDP (compared to 85% today) The deficit would be \u00c2\u00a366.2bn higher in 2017-18, rising to \u00c2\u00a3158.5 billion higher by 2021-22 And to sum up: The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets would be missed by wide margins. This chart shows the full damage, and explains why the OBR fears Britain is in a vulnerable position when the next crisis strikes. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor has also responded: The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has described the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The broad message from the Office for Budget Responsibility is that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances are in a troubling state, vulnerable to nasty surprises, and with a shedload of troubles looming on the horizons. And Brexit could make this whole situation worse, as slower growth over the long term could drive the debt/GDP ratio into the danger zone, over 100%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report reaches three main conclusions: 1) The government must keep \u00e2\u20ac\u0153endogenous risks under review\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That means risks created or influenceable by government policy - everything from the pension triple-lock to the cost of cleaning up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear power stations. The problem, I suspect, is that there may not be many votes in dealing with certain risks.... 2) Britain must prepare for shocks. There may not be a recession this year. Or in 2018. But there will be one eventually, so future budgets need to create some fiscal space to react. According to the OBR, Britain will suffer at least one financial crisis and several recessions over the next 50 years. And even if the government avoids a classic economic downturn, the economy could be hurt by a natural disaster, a terror attack or a war. 3) Ministers must deal with many sources of slow-building pressure. Britain has a nasty habit of putting off difficult decisions or unpleasant problems (for example, social care for the elderly). But problems don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go away if you ignore them. They just build up. This chart shows how the ratio between retirees and workers will rise steadily over the next few decades. More old people will need support, and the pool of taxpayers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow fast enough to keep pace. Political and financial journalists and commentators are trawling through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiscal Risks report, and tweeting the key points and hidden gems. Here are some of the best so far: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiscal Risks report includes this chart, showing the key threats to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances: The cost of supporting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ageing population is the biggest single pressure on public spending, says the OBR. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report states: Pressures on public spending abound. By far the biggest relate to health, where an ageing population is raising demand while technological advances raise costs. Ageing also creates pressures on adult social care and the state pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which each face policy-driven cost pressures in the form of the National Living Wage and the triple lock respectively. But there are many other pressure too. The OBR suggests: The uncertain costs of cleaning up nuclear power stations, compensating victims of clinical negligence and reimbursing tax that the courts determine should not have been collected. In the near term the Government may also need to finance an extensive programme of fire safety measures in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. All these have to be considered in the context of medium-term spending plans that imply significant real terms cuts in spending per person over the next three years, on top of those implemented since 2010. And on the increasingly unpopular 1% public sector pay cap... the OBR cautions that the money would have to come from somewhere.... Lifting current limits on public sector pay increases would pose a fiscal challenge to the extent that departments had their budgets increased to pay for it, rather than simply giving them greater flexibility over how they manage their pay bills. The Office For Budget Responsibility is also critical of the state of the UK public finances. The independent watchdog warns that Britain is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more sensitive to interest rate and inflation surprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than in the past -- hardly a ringing endorsement of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the economy. It says: We produce this report at a sensitive time. A decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis and recession, net borrowing is well down from its peak. But the budget is still in deficit by 2 to 3 per cent of GDP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it was on the eve of the crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and net debt is more than double its pre-crisis share of GDP and not yet falling. As a result, the public finances are much more sensitive to interest rate and inflation surprises than they were. The OBR also highlights the recent turmoil in Westminster: In terms of the political backdrop, the previous Government had to abandon a number of measures to increase taxes and cut welfare spending, the new Government has just agreed a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfidence and supply\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement that increases public spending significantly in Northern Ireland and the Chancellor of the Exchequer notes of austerity that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people are weary of the long slog\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The OBR also identifies \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcausterity fatigue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as a threat to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control of the fiscal purse strings. The OBR makes a very important point about Brexit. The long-term impact of leaving the EU will have a bigger impact on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term fiscal heath than the upfront cost of exiting the EU. And a small hit to growth over the long term would drive Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt dramatically higher. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, the watchdog says: The new Government must also manage the risks posed by Brexit. These do not supplant the possible shocks and likely pressures that we have already discussed, but they could affect the likelihood and impact of many of them. A lot of attention focuses on the possible \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdivorce bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but, while some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU and other trading partners for the long-term growth of the UK economy, which we do not attempt to predict here. If GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 85%, so you can see how significant slower growth would be over half a century.... The chance of a recession in any five-year period is around one in two, says the OBR. And financial crises come along too often for comfort too. The OBR says: The chance of a financial crisis in any five-year period is around one in four, but thankfully not all are as big or as costly as the most recent one. Breaking: The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog, has just published its latest Fiscal Risk report. It urges the UK government to prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunexpected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprises (and not the nice sort, either), given its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vulnerable fiscal position and a challenging political environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The report points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget is still in deficit by 2 to 3 per cent of GDP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it was on the eve of the crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and net debt is more than double its pre-crisis share of GDP and not yet falling. The OBR says that Westminster should remember that recessions and financial crises are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost inevitable over a 50-year horizon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and plan accordingly. The main message is clear: governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and plan accordingly. And they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks. And for that reason, the OBR says, the Treasury should be cautious of signing off unfunded spending commitments. But new unfunded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaways\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would take the Government further away from its medium-term fiscal objective and would only add to the longer-term challenges. In many recent fiscal events, giveaways today have been financed by the promise of takeaways tomorrow. The risk there, of course, is that tomorrow never comes. More to follow.... AstraZeneca is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index, with investors unnerved by a media report that chief executive Pascal Soriot has been offered a job by Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. AstraZeneca declined to comment, saying it never comments on market speculation. Its shares fell more than 5% in early trading and were later down 4.7% at \u00c2\u00a349.49. Financial news website Calcalist said Soriot would earn twice as much as his predecessor at Teva and receive a signing-on bonus of about $20m, although the financial terms were still being discussed. Teva has been without a permanent CEO since February when Erez Vigodman stepped down, and its finance chief Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of last month. Soriot has run Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest drugmaker since 2012 and famously fought off a takeover approach from American rival Pfizer at \u00c2\u00a355 a share in 2014. He has focused on rebuilding the drug pipeline to replace lost revenues after a string of patent expiries on blockbuster medicines, by investing in areas such as immuno-oncology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drugs that harness the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system to fight cancer. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit survey has also found that demand for buy-to-let loans has fallen. That may show that recent tax changes, which make BTL less profitable, are hitting demand. Other mortgage lending remained solid, though. The BoE says: Lenders reported that demand for secured lending for house purchase was unchanged in Q2 (Chart 3 below). Within this, demand for prime lending increased and demand for buy-to-let lending decreased significantly. Lenders expected total demand for secured lending for house purchase to increase in Q3, driven by an increase in buy-to-let lending and a slight increase in prime lending. Demand for remortgaging was reported to have decreased slightly in Q2, but was expected to be unchanged in Q3. Back in April, the government began cutting back at the interest relief enjoyed by BTL landlords. Those changes will stop them deducting mortgage interest and other finance-related costs from their rental income before calculating their tax liability. Some landlords say their total tax bill will soar, making buy-to-let much less financially attractive.... Cambridge economics professor Victoria Bateman is concerned by the rise in credit card defaults: Economist Rupert Seggins shows why we should take the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey seriously: In an alarming development, more people are defaulting on their credit card bills and other unsecured loans. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of credit conditions has found that the default rates on both credit card and other unsecured lending to UK households have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the second quarter of this year. Worryingly, defaults are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expected to increase further on credit card lending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the third quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that UK households are struggling to meet their financial obligations, perhaps because inflation is now outstripping wage growth. As this chart shows, there was a sharp jump in the number of lenders reporting that default rates have risen. Newsflash: The availability of credit in the UK economy is likely to fall this summer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest credit conditions survey. It suggests that banks and other lenders are becoming more cautious about making new loans, reflecting caution over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. The survey found that there will be less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecured credit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as a mortgage, on offer over the next quarter. This will particular affect people who only have a small deposit for their house. The Bank of England says: The availability of secured credit to households was reported to have increased in the three months to mid-June 2017 (Chart 1 below), driven by lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market share objectives. But lenders expect availability to fall slightly over the next three months to mid-September, reflecting a changing appetite for risk. Lenders expect that slight reduction in availability to affect only borrowers with loan to value (LTV) ratios of more than 75%, and in particular those with a LTV ratio of more than 90%. Lenders also told the BoE that the availability of unsecured credit (such as credit cards) dropped in the last three months. It will probably continue to decline as lending criteria are tightened up.... Lenders reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households had decreased in Q2 (Chart 2), and expected a further decrease in Q3. A changing appetite for risk was reported to be an important driver of this in Q2 and Q3, with a changing economic outlook also affecting expectations for Q3. Credit scoring criteria for granting both credit card and other unsecured loans were reported to have tightened again in Q2, with lenders expecting further tightening in Q3. Troubled construction group Carillion is having another bad day. Shares have hit fresh record lows this morning, as the shock profit warning issued on Monday continues to alarm investors. They fell as low as 51p, down another 10% today. That meant Carillion has lost almost three quarters (!) of its value this week, since shocking shareholders by taking a monster\u00c2\u00a3845m provision against contract losses. Analysts believe Carillion needs to raise \u00c2\u00a3500m in fresh capital to avoid collapse - or more than double its current value. My colleague Simon Goodley explains what went terribly badly wrong: For many, the morning of 8 July promised a feast of sport: the British Lions Test in New Zealand, a Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Test and Wimbledon. But a small group of bankers were about to have their weekend ruined by a summons to an emergency meeting in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maddox Street. Board papers had been delivered to the homes of the directors of Carillion, a FTSE 250 business best known as a builder that works on huge construction projects, and the documents contained disturbing news. A review of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances, commissioned two months earlier from accountants KPMG, had unearthed a gaping hole in the accounts. Meetings through Saturday and Sunday produced an 800-word statement to the stock exchange, which shocked the City when it was released at 7am on Monday morning. It was a monster profit warning following an \u00c2\u00a3845m writedown, of which \u00c2\u00a3375m related to three large public private partnership (PPP) contracts in the UK and \u00c2\u00a3470m to the cost of pulling out of several markets in the Middle East and Canada.... Over in the City, shares in home shopping group N Brown have slumped by 8% in early trading. The company has just admitted that it sold flawed insurance products for many years, and faces a \u00c2\u00a340m bill to put it right. The pound is also rallying against the euro, up 0.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.133. That takes sterling away from the eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.119 struck yesterday. The pound has jumped after Ian McCafferty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about possibly unwinding QE early hit the wires. Sterling has gained more than half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.295. That adds to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, when the US dollar fell generally following Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony. A Bank of England policymaker has spiced up the growing debate over UK monetary policy, by calling for an early end to its huge quantitative easing programme. Ian McCafferty, who is one of the most hawkish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, argued that the BoE should rethink its current policy of not unwinding QE until interest rates have risen close to more normal levels. Speaking to The Times, McCafferty point out that the Federal Reserve is already outlining plans to normalise its balance sheet: Given that other central banks are thinking about it, I think it would be remiss of us not to at least think about it. The Bank of England currently holds \u00c2\u00a3435bn of debt (mostly government bonds), bought with newly created money during the financial crisis. QE drove up asset prices, pushed down Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs, and (apparently) stimulated the economy. Unwinding the programme is going to be tricky, and could easily drive up the long-term cost of borrowing - crucially important to banks, mortgage-payers and governments alike. The Bank of England has previously explained that QE wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be touched until interest rates had returned to 2% (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just 0.25% today). McCafferty also dropped a loud hint that he is planning to vote for an interest rate hike in August - as he did in June. He said: As of today, I would not be changing my position. This means that August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch meeting is likely to see a big split at the Bank; Michael Saunders is also expected to vote to hike borrowing costs, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speculation that chief economist Andy Haldane could join the hawks too. McCafferty argued that the UK economy could handle higher interest rates, pointing out that the jobless rate has hit a 42-year low. He also warned that inflation is likely to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peak at over 3 percent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - well over the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are pushing higher today as investors digest yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. Asian stock markets have hit a two-year high, following gains on Wall Street, after Yellen was more dovish than expected. The Fed chair signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise gradually, and singled out weak inflation as a key factor. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Equity markets jumped sharply yesterday with the Dow hitting a new record high, while the US dollar slumped after Fed chief Janet Yellen caught investors by surprise by leaning back from the prospect of multiple rate hikes in the coming months. Market reaction was also reinforced by her comments that inflation was running below target and that rates wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to rise much further to get back to neutral. This comment in particular suggests that the Fed believes that a lot of the heavy lifting on rates may well have been done in the short term, which may help explain why we saw long term yields slip back down to a one week low, and certainly takes a September rate rise off the table. European markets romped ahead during Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, and are expected to hold onto those gains this morning But the mood could change at 9.30am, when the latest UK consumer credit figures are released. They will show whether Britons have been hitting their credit cards, to cope with the fact wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping up with prices. The data could also show whether lenders have been more cautious about extending credit. RBC Capital Markets say: Last time the survey indicated that lenders were anticipating tightening conditions on unsecured household lending so this edition will reveal whether or not that intention came to fruition. We also get the latest US weekly jobs report, while Janet Yellen will head back to Capitol Hill for a second day of testimony. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England credit conditions survey 1.30pm: US weekly initial jobless claims figures 3pm: Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking committee",

                "body":"<p>There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p> <p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs.</p> <p>Now, for the first time in years, it is fair to ask: which side is London really on? And there is an uglier secondary question: are our politicians leaning on the regulators?</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/city-regulator-plans-rule-change-to-allow-aramco-flotation-in-london\" title=\"\">proposing bending the London listing rules to attract Aramco</a>, Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-owned oil company, the Financial Conduct Authority has sown the seed of distrust and provoked fury among fund managers.</p> <p>The rule change can be dressed up as minor. The FCA is merely proposing to create a special listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states. That, in itself, is not controversial: companies in the process of privatisation can indeed be viewed as of a special type.</p> <p>The problem is that the FCA wants to allow such companies into its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd listing category while waiving two essential requirements of that description. The state-controlled companies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to give outside shareholders a vote on the appointment of directors who will represent their interests on the board. And worse, the likes of Aramco will be able to ignore rules on related-party transactions that other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd companies must obey. In theory, Aramco, which is looking to list only 5% of its shares, could sell 20% of its assets to the Saudi state and inform outside investors only at a later date.</p> <p>Whatever gloss one applies, calling such companies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is absurd. The label is meant to denote the highest standards of investor protection. The Investment Association, which represents most of the big fund management houses, hit the nail on the head: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors believe a premium-listed segment without these protections is not a premium segment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The FCA argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That may be true, but, for heaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gloss over those risks by awarding top marks to companies that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve them. The Saudi royal family may want their $2 trillion oil company to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status, but, if the facts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit, that should be the end of the matter.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, had been considered the smart-money bet for next governor of the Bank of England. In only a year, he has given the organisation a much-needed air of competence. This Aramco decision, however, looks like a desperate attempt to please political masters who crave a post-Brexit endorsement of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pulling power.</p> <p>Bailey and the FCA should have displayed their independence and declared that the likes of Aramco should make do with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd listing. It would also have been acceptable to create a purely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sovereign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd label and keep Aramco well away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd club. Instead, the FCA has exposed the London market to the allegation that a whiff of foreign money can produce favourable rulings. The City will pay a price in the end, and Bailey already looks a smaller figure.</p> <h2>Has anyone mentioned the S-word?<br></h2> <p>The dreaded word stagflation cannot be yet be applied to the British economy, but it may not be long before it is. Inflation remains persistently high while GDP growth is slowing to a point well below the long-run trend. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/12/uk-pay-squeeze-real-wages-tuc-unemployment-ons-figures\" title=\"\">Wages are growing at a sluggish pace</a> and business investment has almost evaporated. To make matters worse, the fall in the pound that has generated much of the increase in prices, particularly for food and clothes, has done little to improve the trade deficit.</p> <p>It all adds up to the average British worker putting in a 40-hour week for a salary that will be worth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once prices are taken into account \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than it was the month before. No wonder discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are cleaning up. Shoppers are sure to seek a cheaper alternative when the pressure is on.</p> <p>Inflation figures due on Tuesday are not expected to alter this dire situation. In May the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/13/uk-inflation-rises-faster-than-expected-four-year-high\" title=\"\">consumer prices index stood at 2.9%</a> and the Reuters poll of City economists resulted in a forecast for June of 2.9%. Plenty of predictions indicate that inflation is only going to get higher as the year wears on.</p> <p>With wage rises averaging 2% in May and likely to stick at this rate throughout 2017, the hit to household disposable incomes is significant. Even more so for those in the public sector, where a 1% pay freeze is in operation.</p> <p>The first thing economists are going to ask is whether the figures will shift opinion on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee towards an interest rate rise.</p> <p>Three committee members voted last month for an increase, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/22/inflation-rate-increase-economy-bank-mpc-member\" title=\"\">one of those has since left</a> and new joiners are not known for voting against the consensus in their first few meetings. That means governor Mark Carney will say the inflation numbers are not bad enough to spur him and the rest of the committee into action, and most of his colleagues will nod in agreement.</p> <p>Their fear must be that stagflation is around the corner, and with Brexit looming, it is only getting nearer.</p> <h2>Revenue chase puts Carillion up against the wall</h2> <p>How can Carillion, a company with 48,000 employees and a \u00c2\u00a35bn turnover, be exposed as a financial mess <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/carillion-has-no-future-without-rights-issue-of-at-least-500m\" title=\"\">in one stock exchange statement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as the one that sent its shares crashing 70% last week</a>?</p> <p>A clue can be found in March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, where chairman Philip Green wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The group has once again delivered strong revenue growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>If that sounds benign, it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. A construction company that prides itself on growing revenues is dangerous. If it wins contracts by accepting too many risks, disaster often follows. Carillion was floored by just four contracts that went awry. The provision for write-downs is a colossal \u00c2\u00a3845m.</p> <p>The other part of the story is Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy borrowings. It is towing \u00c2\u00a3695m plus a big deficit in its pension fund. But the point remains: in the construction business, risk-controls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not revenues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are everything. A chairman who told investors about contracts that were refused would be worth listening to.</p>",

The Investment Association, which represents most of the big fund management houses, hit the nail on the head: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors believe a premium-listed segment without these protections is not a premium segment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FCA argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That may be true, but, for heaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gloss over those risks by awarding top marks to companies that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve them. The Saudi royal family may want their $2 trillion oil company to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status, but, if the facts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit, that should be the end of the matter. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, had been considered the smart-money bet for next governor of the Bank of England. In only a year, he has given the organisation a much-needed air of competence. This Aramco decision, however, looks like a desperate attempt to please political masters who crave a post-Brexit endorsement of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pulling power. Bailey and the FCA should have displayed their independence and declared that the likes of Aramco should make do with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd listing. It would also have been acceptable to create a purely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sovereign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd label and keep Aramco well away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd club. Instead, the FCA has exposed the London market to the allegation that a whiff of foreign money can produce favourable rulings. The City will pay a price in the end, and Bailey already looks a smaller figure. Has anyone mentioned the S-word? The dreaded word stagflation cannot be yet be applied to the British economy, but it may not be long before it is. Inflation remains persistently high while GDP growth is slowing to a point well below the long-run trend. Wages are growing at a sluggish pace and business investment has almost evaporated. To make matters worse, the fall in the pound that has generated much of the increase in prices, particularly for food and clothes, has done little to improve the trade deficit. It all adds up to the average British worker putting in a 40-hour week for a salary that will be worth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once prices are taken into account \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than it was the month before. No wonder discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are cleaning up. Shoppers are sure to seek a cheaper alternative when the pressure is on. Inflation figures due on Tuesday are not expected to alter this dire situation. In May the consumer prices index stood at 2.9% and the Reuters poll of City economists resulted in a forecast for June of 2.9%. Plenty of predictions indicate that inflation is only going to get higher as the year wears on. With wage rises averaging 2% in May and likely to stick at this rate throughout 2017, the hit to household disposable incomes is significant. Even more so for those in the public sector, where a 1% pay freeze is in operation. The first thing economists are going to ask is whether the figures will shift opinion on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee towards an interest rate rise. Three committee members voted last month for an increase, but one of those has since left and new joiners are not known for voting against the consensus in their first few meetings. That means governor Mark Carney will say the inflation numbers are not bad enough to spur him and the rest of the committee into action, and most of his colleagues will nod in agreement. Their fear must be that stagflation is around the corner, and with Brexit looming, it is only getting nearer. Revenue chase puts Carillion up against the wall How can Carillion, a company with 48,000 employees and a \u00c2\u00a35bn turnover, be exposed as a financial mess in one stock exchange statement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as the one that sent its shares crashing 70% last week? A clue can be found in March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, where chairman Philip Green wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The group has once again delivered strong revenue growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If that sounds benign, it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. A construction company that prides itself on growing revenues is dangerous. If it wins contracts by accepting too many risks, disaster often follows. Carillion was floored by just four contracts that went awry. The provision for write-downs is a colossal \u00c2\u00a3845m. The other part of the story is Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy borrowings. It is towing \u00c2\u00a3695m plus a big deficit in its pension fund. But the point remains: in the construction business, risk-controls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not revenues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are everything. A chairman who told investors about contracts that were refused would be worth listening to.",

June monthly indicators, such as industrial production and retails sales, are also showing strength. Monetary tightening has helped slow the domestic economy but the upside in Q2 2017 GDP came from stronger external demand. Due to stronger than expected growth in the first half of this year, we have revised up our 2017 GDP forecast to 6.8% from 6.7%. We still expect a mild slowdown in H2 2017.</p> <p>Over the weekend President Xi of China announced the creation of a super regulator called the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC).

                "bodyText":"Stronger than expected economic growth from China set a positive note initially for investors. But there was still some caution ahead of a busy week for US company results, while weak US manufacturing figures added to the expectation that the Federal Reserve would hold back on further rate rises. So in all it was a mixed performance. Most European markets dipped back, but the Chinese data helped lift commodity prices and in turn mining shares, which pushed the FTSE 100 higher. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European equity markets are mixed today, but London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large exposure to commodity related companies has given it the edge over its eurozone counterparts. The better-than-expected growth numbers from China boosted the share price of Rio Tinto, Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton. The second-largest economy in the world is easily on target to achieve its 2017 growth target of 6.5%, as it grew by 6.9% in the first quarter and second quarter. Meanwhile the MSCI World Index has reached a new record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shrugged off early losses to edge higher, after hitting another intra day peak on Friday. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 25.74 points or 0.35% higher at 7404.13 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.35% to 12,587.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.1% lower at 5230.17 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.03% to 21,484.84 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.04% to 10,651.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.19% to 858.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 15 points or 0.07%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably no surprise that US markets are drifting a little, since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the start of a busy week for company results. The economic reform plans of French president Emmanuel Macron have received a positive reception from the International Monetary Fund. In its latest statement after a staff visit to the county the IMF said: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious reform program could go a long way in addressing France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longstanding economic challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpersistent fiscal imbalances, high unemployment, and weak external competitiveness. The emphasis on reducing public spending, to allow gradual fiscal consolidation and tax relief, is appropriate. To make the strategy credible, deep reforms are needed at all levels of government, with major spending efforts from the start. The labor market strategy is broad and ambitious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit would enhance enterprise-level flexibility, reform unemployment insurance, and improve professional training and apprenticeship systems. It should be complemented by continued wage moderation. The planned corporate, capital, and labor tax reforms should boost investment and job growth. To maximize the impact, the package should include measures to reduce the corporate tax debt bias, remove inefficient exemptions, address disincentives to company growth, and streamline the taxation of long-term savings. The full report is here. Gold is moving higher, with the dollar weakening as the idea of another rate rise from the US Federal Reserve continues to fade. It has added $6 an ounce to $1234, while silver is also higher, up from $15.99 to $16.17. Meanwhile with the New York manufacturing data the latest to hit the dollar, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in negative territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following a far worse than forecast Empire State manufacturing index reading, falling from 19.8 to 9.8 month-on-month, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much reason for the Dow Jones to build on its recent highs this Monday...In general the week is a bit light on Grade A data from the US, meaning the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements may end up being dictated by its reporting companies rather than any rate hike chatter. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAC spent the day flitting from red to green and back again...The FTSE remained far and away Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best performer, even if it fell from its midday peak. The UK index is up 50 points, and is just about keeping its head above 7400, thanks to the dual boosts of some China-inspired gains in the commodity sector and a Brexit-dragged showing from sterling, which is down between 0.1-0.2% against the dollar and the euro. The pound is set to jump back into the spotlight tomorrow morning with the release of the latest inflation reading. Analysts are expecting the figure to remain unchanged at a still eye-watering 2.9%, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the number has outperformed forecasts for the last 4 months in a row. After facing the public in Birmingham last year to try and explain its role and its actions to boost the economy, the Bank of England is venturing out again, this time to Liverpool. On 16 November, governor Mark Carney and his team will be holding the latest Future Forum, including discussing how the Bank has been trying to make its work more accessible. The Bank said: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be talking about economics and the economy and explaining to people how the financial world affects their lives. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be discussing what the Bank can do to raise public understanding of its role in the economy...This year, more than ever, the emphasis is on communications \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, the exchange of ideas. We want to have a real two-way conversation with the wider public, hearing from those whose lives are influenced by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, listening, just as much as speaking. Last year there was certainly an exchange of ideas, given the meeting followed the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut interest rates in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Carney found himself on the defensive after Theresa May suggested at the Tory party conference that it was only the rich that benefitted from low interest rates and the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money printing policy. Carney said he was not going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: The MSCI world index may have hit a new high but elsewhere the picture is not quite as clear cut. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which touched a new peak during Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session - is virtually flat, up just 2 points ahead of a a big weak for US earnings. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also marginally higher. Elsewhere the FTSE 100 is currently up 28 points or 0.39% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac are both slightly down on the day. Over in the US, and there have been some poor manufacturing figures from New York. The Empire State manufacturing index dropped from 19.8 to 9.8 in July, missing expectations of a smaller decline to 15. The news saw the dollar slip slightly, with the data adding to the idea that the US Federal Reserve may hold fire on further interest rate rises. Last week Fed chair Janet Yellen gave what was interpreted as a fairly dovish testimony to the Senate. Ahead of the Empire figures, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: An unexpectedly cautious testimony from Fed chief Janet Yellen to US lawmakers, as well as some disappointing economic data on the part of the US consumer and some more weak inflation data appears to raising doubts about the pace of future US rate rises. Back with the Chinese growth figures and the financial oversight news. Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at Nordic bank SEB, said: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second quarter 2017 GDP remained elevated at 6.9% year-on-year and beat the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations of 6.8%. June monthly indicators, such as industrial production and retails sales, are also showing strength. Monetary tightening has helped slow the domestic economy but the upside in Q2 2017 GDP came from stronger external demand. Due to stronger than expected growth in the first half of this year, we have revised up our 2017 GDP forecast to 6.8% from 6.7%. We still expect a mild slowdown in H2 2017. Over the weekend President Xi of China announced the creation of a super regulator called the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC). This move clearly shows that the government and President Xi see the increasing risk from financial market instability as a priority. The contagion risk bleeding from financial market risk to political risk has grown to a point where President Xi needs to monitor this at the State Council level. Another implication is that financial market development will slow as when authorities are focused on risk, the market becomes more conservative and liberalisation slows. The other news out of China today is that Winnie the Pooh has seemingly fallen foul of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet censors. The much-loved, tubby bear can no longer be discussed on Chinese social media sites, apparently as part of a new crackdown by Beijing. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad for Pooh; he has been given a prime position on the front page of the Financial Times, which says: Posts including the Chinese name of the fictional bear were censored on Sina Weibo, ChinaTwitter-like platform, over the weekend, while a collection of animated gifs featuring the bear were removed from social messaging app WeChat. While no official explanation was given, observers suggested the crackdown was related to previous comparisons of President Xi Jinping with the portly bear created by the English author AA Milne that went viral. Apart from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, economists are also digesting the conclusions of a conference on regulation held by Chinese officials last weekend. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much interest in president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to create a cabinet-level committee to coordinate financial oversight. That could be a sign that Beijing is more concerned about problems brewing in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system. The official statement issued after the conference said that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eternal theme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was to prevent systemic risk building up in the Chinese economy. Premier Li Keqiang called for financial oversight to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153professional, consolidated and penetrating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and there was also a warning that failing to spot problems Strong words were also heard on greater accountability for regulators, with the statement saying it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dereliction of duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if regulators fail to spot risks and tackle them in time... Capital Economics says these pledges are more important than the actual growth figures..... This also explains why the Chinese stock market fell today, while other market rallied. A clampdown on risky lending, or financial bubbles, would surely feed through to asset prices... Several economists are predicting that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate will ease, sooner or later. Zhou Hao, an economist with Commerzbank, says (via the WSJ): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though the Chinese economy was holding up better than expected in the first half of the year, a slowdown is kind of inevitable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Chinese growth will hold up for a few months more. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: If China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP does hold up, then it could post its first year of faster growth since 2010. Dan Wang, China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures bode well for the next six months.... China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will hold up for the second half of the year, given sustained state-led investment and robust household spending. The monetary policy will remain neutral--cracking down shadow banking while increasing lending through formal banking channel. Given the high base in 2017, however, to sustain high growth for 2018 will be tough. The pound has fallen back from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-month high this morning, as City traders fret about Brexit. David Davis, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary of state for exiting the European Union, is back in Brussels for fresh talks with EU officials (although only one side had their paperwork on display.....) The weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newspapers brought a blizzard of negative stories about cabinet members, particularly Philip Hammond. The chancellor was roasted for telling colleagues that public sector workers were overpaid, and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjoking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that even a woman could drive a train (unless she was too busy starring in Dr Who or running the country, I guess). Transport secretary Chris Grayling has now denied that the cabinet is riven with infighting, but this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the pound losing 0.2% to $1.307. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim last week that the EU could \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhistle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for an exit payment from Britain has also worried the City. Joshua Mahony of IG says: UK-EU Brexit discussions continue apace today, with the relationship seemingly souring amid critical comments from Boris Johnson and a drive from France towards a hard Brexit. There is now a clear need to get a transitional deal into place, with the negotiations looking ever more unlikely to conclude satisfactorily within the two-year deadline. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! Inflation across the eurozone eased a little last month. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index rose by 1.3% in June, says Eurostat, matching last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on 1.4% in May, and further away from the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just below 2%. As this tweet shows, prices are rising rather faster in the UK, where CPI hit 2.9% in May. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK inflation data is out tomorrow, and will probably show that the cost of living squeeze continues.... China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are often treated with some scepticism. Analysts often question whether the data can really be trusted, given the temptation to massage bad date and the sheer challenge of measuring economic output over such a huge economy. And China certainly has an impressive track record of hitting Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official growth targets..... But having said that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report is being taken quite seriously, thanks to the flurry of decent retail sales, investment and factory production data. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services has all the details: It was the monthly data which impressed, with Retail Sales at 11.0% y/y posting its strongest growth since December 2015, and all the more robust given that this is a value not a volume measure, and CPI inflation has been very subdued in recent months. Industrial Production \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmashed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts at 7.6% vs. expectations of an unchanged 6.5% y/y, with the breakdown highlighting strength in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Telecoms/Computing 13.1% y/y vs prior 10.3%), Pharmaceuticals (13.6% vs./ 10.75) and the volatile / seasonal Food sector 11.0% vs. 7.6%), while resource processing sectors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 output remains subdued, which can only be considered to be healthy. Taking all of this in conjunction with the solid 7.2% y/y in the Private sector investment component of Fixed Asset Investment (8.6% vs. expected 8.5%), there is goodly volume of evidence that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is indeed rebalancing away from being investment led to consumption led, paced both by domestic and external demand, given the 3.6% contribution from Net Exports to 2017 H1 GDP. UK construction companies are rubbing their hands with glee this morning after winning contracts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new HS2 high-speed rail line. The government has awarded \u00c2\u00a36.6bn of work to construct the section between London and Birmingham. Successful bidders include Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint venture with French construction company Eiffage and UK firm Kier. Carillion desperately needs some good news, after shocking the City a week ago with a whopping profits warning and huge writedowns on certain contracts. Shares in ITV have jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after the broadcaster snaffled Carolyn McCall from easyJet to be its next CEO. ITV announced McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment this morning, two days after we reported she was the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpreferred candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the role. My colleague Mark Sweney has the details: McCall, a former chief executive of the Guardian Media Group, will join ITV on 8 January, replacing Adam Crozier, who left the company at the end of June. ITV chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former chairman and creative chief of Big Brother maker Endemol, had been keen to replace him with a successor with serious experience at a publicly-listed company. McCall has been appointed from a final shortlist of three which included Paul Geddes, the Direct Line chief and Channel 4 board member, and the Dixons Carphone boss, Sebastian James. Bazalgette says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a very impressive field of high-calibre candidates, Carolyn stood out for her track record in media, experience of an international operation, clear strategic acumen and strong record of delivering value to shareholders. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delighted we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be working together at ITV.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: European stock markets have opened higher, thanks to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures. Mining shares are rallying in London, on the prospect of greater demand for copper, nickel, iron ore and coal. And that has pushed the FTSE 100 up by 28 points, or 0.4%, to 7407. The French, German and Spanish markets are also rising, helping to keep global share prices at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time peak. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEX says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traders have begun the week in a good mood, boosted by the wave of data from China. Overnight there was a quartet of important Chinese figures, led by a better than expected 6.9% GDP reading. That was joined by a far stronger than forecast industrial production number, an 11% increase in retail sales year-on-year and solid fixed asset investment figure. China takes in a lot of raw materials, to drive its factories and underpin its infrastructure spending. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising to see commodity prices on the rise, following the Chinese GDP report. In London, Copper has hit its highest level since March, gaining 0.8% to $5,970.5 per tonne. Meanwhile in China, the cosy of steel in China has risen to a new three and a half-year high. Craig James, chief economist at Commonwealth Securities in Sydney, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest growth figures may indicate that the world economy is holding up. He says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(The new data) is encouraging for global growth as well because China is the second largest economy on the planet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on this data, there is no need for easing and no need really for tightening either because inflationary pressures are very much contained. So I think the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China just continues to be watchful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Bank, believes the figures bode well for growth across developing economies. He writes: As China goes, so go emerging markets. Its solid growth reinforces recoveries for commodity exporters and keeps 2017\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in global growth on track,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, points out that the growth was probably driven by borrowing. She writes: China Q2 GDP was firmer than expected (6.9%y/y, cons 6.8%, prior 6.9%), driven by a sizeable pick-up in industrial production. Sentiment was dampened by the Stats Bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acknowledgement that H1 economic growth was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard won\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Our Asia strategist calls that an understatement to be sure; GDP growth was clearly buffered by significant credit expansion to ensure headline growth remained at or above target. Most recognise the dangerous imbalances/can-kicking involved in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth strategy. The news that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP beat expectations drove shares up across Asia, although ironically Chinese investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the enthusiasm. The Hong Kong Hang Seng rose by 0.3%, while Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi and India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sensex gained almost 0.4%. That helped to drive global markets to a new all-time high: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better-than-expected China GDP data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boosted confidence. This after six years of slowing, suggesting successful management of stimulus. However, the party didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach China itself, where the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index dropped by almost 1%. The selloff was sparked by traders rushing to sell shares after the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China injected fresh liquidity into the system. That caused some alarm on the trading floors, as Marketwatch explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reverse psychology,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hao Hong, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If everything is fine, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to inject liquidity. But if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re injecting liquidity, something must be wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China has got the new week off to a good start, by releasing growth figures that beat City expectations. The Chinese economy grew at an annual pace of 6.9% in the last quarter, according to official government figures, matching China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in January-March. That beat analyst forecasts of 6.8%, and is ahead of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of growing GDP by 6.5% this year. This should calm concerns that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is heading for a hard landing, as its leaders try to shift away from manufacturing and towards a service-based economy. The National Bureau of Statistics said the figures showed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more stable, co-ordinated and sustainable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the agency also struck a cautious notes, saying that : Overall, the economy continued to show steady progress in the first half...but international instability and uncertainties are still relatively large, and the domestic long-term buildup of structural imbalances remain. The NBS also warned that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy also faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many unstable and uncertain factors abroad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; perhaps a nod to president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist rhetoric, or perhaps Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU.... Separate government figures also suggested that the Chinese economy seems to be holding up, despite persistent worries over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing debts. They showed that: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory output grew 7.6% in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace in three months, Fixed-asset investment expanded by 8.6% percent in the first six months of 2017 both beating forecasts. Retail sales rose 11.0% in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace since December 2015 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull some reaction together now.... Also coming up today: The final estimate of inflation across the euro area is released this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to confirm that the eurozone inflation rate dropped to 1.3% in June, taking some pressure off the European Central Bank to start tapering its stimulus programme. In the US, we also get a new healthcheck on New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector. 10am BST: Eurozone Consumer Price Index for June 1.30pm BST: The US Empire Manufacturing (JUL)",

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Indecision has once more reigned for the FTSE today...Much of the FTSE and sterling trade has been centred on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI figures, which certainly gave the BoE some much needed breathing space after months of rising inflation and falling wage growth. Crucially, whilst much of the reduction in headline CPI has been attributed to falling energy prices, it is encouraging to see the core CPI figure also tumble, to 2.4%. Real incomes have been eroded in recent months, with the resulting cut in disposable income expected to hit consumer spending habits.</p> </blockquote> <p>In Europe a stronger euro has sent markets lower, ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key driver for European stocks appeared to be the currency, with a stronger euro weighing on appetite for equities.

A lot hinges on some pretty subtle language and shifts in tone by Mario Draghi and the ECB on Thursday. A removal of the easing bias in the policy statement could be enough to push it higher but we must prepare for Mr Draghi to don his dovish cap and talk down the currency lest a stronger euro gets in the way of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:<strong><br></strong></p> <ul> <li><strong> The FTSE 100 finished down 13.91 points or 0.19% at 7390.22<br></strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.25% lower at 12,430.39</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.09% to 5173.27</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 21,358.20</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.19% at 10,524.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.17% to 848.07</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 79 points or 0.37%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

A shift in resources toward Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitive export sector, with the services sector creating most new jobs, has played an important part in the rebound. Banking sector balance sheets are stronger, private sector debt is coming down, and credit availability is improving. As the recovery is maturing, it is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still-ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment. At the same time, reducing structural unemployment and fostering productivity growth remain priorities.

                "bodyText":"It was a tale of banks and currencies in the markets, with investors facing losses of varying sizes almost across the board. Disappointing results from Goldman Sachs, as well as Bank of America, pushed the sector lower and undermined the rest of the market. Meanwhile, lower than expected UK inflation figures sent the pound down 0.2% but did little for the FTSE 100, suffering from falls from Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Indecision has once more reigned for the FTSE today...Much of the FTSE and sterling trade has been centred on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI figures, which certainly gave the BoE some much needed breathing space after months of rising inflation and falling wage growth. Crucially, whilst much of the reduction in headline CPI has been attributed to falling energy prices, it is encouraging to see the core CPI figure also tumble, to 2.4%. Real incomes have been eroded in recent months, with the resulting cut in disposable income expected to hit consumer spending habits. In Europe a stronger euro has sent markets lower, ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The key driver for European stocks appeared to be the currency, with a stronger euro weighing on appetite for equities. The euro/dollar advanced around 0.9% and eased clear of $1.15 to trade at its highest since May 2016 as the euro gained momentum from fresh dollar softness in the wake of the health bill failure. The euro/dollar is now eyeing the May 3 high above $1.16 and, if breached, could start to target the $1.17 handle last seen in August 2015. A lot hinges on some pretty subtle language and shifts in tone by Mario Draghi and the ECB on Thursday. A removal of the easing bias in the policy statement could be enough to push it higher but we must prepare for Mr Draghi to don his dovish cap and talk down the currency lest a stronger euro gets in the way of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 13.91 points or 0.19% at 7390.22 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.25% lower at 12,430.39 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.09% to 5173.27 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 21,358.20 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.19% at 10,524.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.17% to 848.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 79 points or 0.37%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. After the launch of the \u00c2\u00a310 in Winchester, where he said nothing about the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been speaking to Sky about that very subject. He said the figures were consistent with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast that inflation would overshoot its target for some time, and the big picture remained the same: the fall in the pound pushing up prices. The FTSE 100 has slipped back after the weaker than expected inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down on disappointing results and the latest setback for President Trump, but the real declines are in Europe due to the strength of the euro. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Over in the eurozone the Dax and Cac had a serious currency headache, dropping 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling-gains were joined by a similarly strong performance against the dollar, where it surged 0.9% to a fresh 2 and a half month high, now sitting just shy of $1.16. Back with the US and some more disappointing economic figures, this time from the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders housing index slipped from 66 in June to 64 this month, lower than the expected figure of 67. This is the lowest reading since last November. NAHB chairman Granger MacDonald said: Our members are telling us they are growing increasingly concerned over rising material prices, particularly lumber. This is hurting housing affordability even as consumer interest in the new-home market remains strong. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery remains strong but the country still needs structural reforms to cope with any future economic shocks, says the International Monetary Fund, which has also upgraded its growth forecast. In its latest report it said: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery remains strong, with consumption, investment, and net exports all contributing to a more balanced growth pattern. A shift in resources toward Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitive export sector, with the services sector creating most new jobs, has played an important part in the rebound. Banking sector balance sheets are stronger, private sector debt is coming down, and credit availability is improving. As the recovery is maturing, it is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still-ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment. At the same time, reducing structural unemployment and fostering productivity growth remain priorities. Without farther determined progress on structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers, the economy would remain vulnerable to shocks and risk leaving some segments of the population behind. The IMF has raised its economic growth forecast from 2.6% this year to 3.1%, saying: Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent this year, and there is upside risk as the momentum created by past reforms may be bigger than estimated. But it added: [Challenges} need to be fully addressed to offset the expected slow-down in medium-term growth and to build greater resilience. Public debt and structural unemployment are still high, population aging is creating fiscal pressures, and productivity lags that of EU peers. In addition, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net debtor position with the rest of the world remains large, and financial sector adjustment and further reforms to strengthen and modernize the institutional arrangements are yet to be fully completed. The latest setback for Donald Trump and his healthcare plans has prompted speculation the President will struggle to get other measures passed - notably tax reform - and unsettled investors. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 62 points or 0.29%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down similar amounts. Healthcare companies were under pressure while uninspiring results from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs saw their shares slip back. But Netflix has jumped nearly 10% after the streaming service topped 100m subscribers, helped by growth outside the US. Here is our report on the launch, from Steven Morris. And the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press release and Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are here. So far no economic commentary from Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who has been praising Austen and putting the new tenner in the context of the history of banknotes. The unveiling of the \u00c2\u00a310 note is underway and can be seen live here. Later this afternoon, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is at Winchester Cathedral to launch the new polymer \u00c2\u00a310 note featuring Jane Austen. Given the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures and the implications for interest rates, it will be interesting to see what, if any, comments he makes on the UK economy. The launch of the plastic fiver last June came not long before the EU referendum, so Carney stuck to the subject of banknotes rather than wider economic issues. The pound is still on the slide after the weaker than expected inflation figures suggested a Bank of England rate rise could be some way off. Against the dollar, sterling is now down 0.3% at $1.3016 and 0.9% lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1265. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga reckons the pound could fall further: The fact that sterling sharply depreciated across the board on Tuesday, after British inflation rates unexpectedly dropped to 2.6% in June, continues to highlight how the currency has become increasingly sensitive to monetary policy speculation. Price action suggests that those who were heavily reliant on the possibility that higher rates would support sterling further were left empty-handed, as deceleration in inflation eroded expectations of a UK rate increase in 2017. Although the Bank of England has adopted a hawkish tone in recent weeks, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in inflation is likely to ease pressure on the Bank of England taking action, consequently keeping hawks at bay... Investors should keep in mind that the fundamentals behind sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes remain intact, with sellers potentially exploiting rate hike speculations and dollar weakness to install fresh rounds of selling. From a technical standpoint, a decisive breakdown and daily close below 1.3000 should encourage a further decline towards 1.2850. Time for a recap, for those of just tuning in. UK inflation fell unexpectedly in June for the first time in nine months as lower fuel prices provided some respite for cash-strapped consumers. The consumer prices index fell to 2.6% from a four-year high of 2.9% in May according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected the rate to be unchanged. The fall was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, reflecting weaker global oil prices. Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June, compared with a 2.2% rise over the same month a year earlier. Lower prices of games and toys also contributed to the fall. However, at 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, and signalled a sustained fall in real wages as prices rise faster than current pay growth of 2%..... Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the government must act to halt the decline in living standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must stop this cost of living squeeze. Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. Ministers claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that some households were struggling financially. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have introduced the national living wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00c2\u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angela Monaghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the data: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the key charts: Economists have warned that families still face a cost of living squeeze. Maike Currie of Fidelity International says: Our pay packets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping up with rising prices despite the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate reaching its lowest level since 1975. This is tightening the squeeze on UK households, which is bad news for an economy that relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services. Calum Bennie of Scottish Friendly adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite a drop in the headline rate of inflation, many families will still be facing the same relentless pressure to make ends meet. The cost of food, household goods and furniture all became more expensive in June and with wage growth still flat those at the bottom will continue to turn to credit or rapidly deplete savings just to keep food on the table. Sterling sharply when the data was released. It has subsided further as traders concluded that UK interest rates are now less likely to rise this year. The pound is now trading at $1.3010, a whole cent lower than early this morning. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says consumers should cheer today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data: Firstly, it means the squeeze on real incomes in 2017 and 2018 will be less severe and less pronounced than some have feared. Secondly, it removes the threat of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. An August increase in the cost of borrowing, while never looking all that likely, is now off the agenda. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his full analysis: Danske Bank economist Conor Lambe fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage squeeze is hurting economic growth. And we could get the proof next Wednesday, when growth figures for the April-June quarter is released. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The CPI inflation rate in the UK was 2.6 per cent in June 2017, lower than the 2.9 per cent observed in May. This fall was mainly due to lower fuel prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour market data showed that the rate of nominal wage growth over the year to March-May 2017 was 2 per cent. Therefore, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the inflation rate, real wage growth is still in negative territory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Above target inflation, and the accompanying negative real wage growth, is continuing to squeeze UK consumers and this is likely to be reflected in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter of this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart, showing how expectations of a UK interest rate rise this year have fallen: The Office for National Statistics has also reported that house price inflation has slowed. Average house prices in the UK rose by 4.7% in the year to May 2017, down from 5.3% in the year to April 2017. This could be another sign that the economy is slowing, and that households are feeling the squeeze from inflation and weak wage growth. The East of England saw the fastest growth, at 7.5% year on year. The lowest annual growth was in the North East, where prices increased by 1.6% over the year, followed by London at 3.0%. On a regional basis, London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00c2\u00a3481,000, followed by the South East and the East of England, which stand at \u00c2\u00a3316,000 and \u00c2\u00a3284,000 respectively. The lowest average price continues to be in the North East at \u00c2\u00a3127,000. Despite the slowdown in London, prices across the capital have outstripped the rest of the country since the last recession: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Nick Leung, research analyst at fund manager WisdomTree, says there are three reasons inflation dropped last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading is slightly softer than expected, underpinned by a combination of oil price weakness, a stabilising pound and import-cost induced inflationary pressures undermining consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt-fuelled spending power.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As long as wages are subdued, rising inflation is clearly bad news for families. James Brown, Partner and head of the UK Consumer &amp; Retail practice at Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, explains why: June is the fifth consecutive month where inflation was above the Bank of England target of 2%, and also considerably higher than the 0.5% level recorded in June last year..... The current rate adds more than \u00c2\u00a350 extra a month to UK households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 monthly expenses covered by CPI compared to the same time last year, putting more pressure on holidays and summer outings budgets. The fall in the value of the pound last June has made foreign holidays much more expensive. But even those who say at home will feel the pinch. Brown explains: Whether families decide to register the children to a kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club or summer camp, or whether groups of friends meet for drinks, they will have to pay more for it than they did last year. The figures for June showed that fees for recreational and sporting services went up by 3.5% and beer is 7.5% more expensive than last year. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target is 2%, so the Bank of England still faces some pressure to consider raising interest rates to push down the cost of living. Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings specialist, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite a drop in the headline rate of inflation, many families will still be facing the same relentless pressure to make ends meet. The cost of food, household goods and furniture all became more expensive in June and with wage growth still flat those at the bottom will continue to turn to credit or rapidly deplete savings just to keep food on the table. As long as this squeeze continues the Bank of England faces a difficult balancing act. While on the one hand raising interest rates may help to combat inflation, on the other it will cause real pain for homeowners who could see the cost of their mortgages rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in inflation in June may show that the cost of living squeeze is rippling through the economy, and making it hard for shops to raise prices. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Markets explains: The slowdown in inflation suggests that the decline in British real wages may have started to translate into a slower consumer inflation, as anticipated by the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhile it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have introduced the National Living Wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00c2\u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 No mention of the public sector pay cap, though, which has caused public splits within Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet. The Unison union is also alarmed that wages are still being eroded by rising cost of living. UNISON assistant general secretary Christina McAnea says public sector workers deserve better: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation much higher than wages, nurses, teaching assistants and care staff are getting poorer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harsh approach to public sector pay is completely out of step with the public mood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every day the pay cap stays, public sector employees are leaving for better paid jobs elsewhere. And it gets that bit harder for the NHS, police forces, schools and town halls to recruit new staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor should show he understands the financial struggles of millions of families and end the pay cap now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the odds of a UK interest rate rise in August have shrunk. He writes: UK inflation fell unexpectedly in June to 2.6%, easing the pressure on squeezed household budgets and substantially reducing the likelihood of an August interest rate rise. The ONS said the drop was largely due to falling motor fuel prices, although core inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which strips out the more volatile components such as fuel and food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also fell, to 2.4%. The news sent the pound sharply lower as currency traders adjusted their outlook for interest rates. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric has taken an increasingly hawkish tone in recent weeks, with Mark Carney himself saying at the end of last month that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Chief economist Andy Haldane also indicated he might support a rate rise this year. However if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pullback in inflation marks the start of a sustained decline, the pressure on the Bank to raise rates will ease. You can read the inflation report online, here. This chart shows clearly how UK pay packets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping up with the cost of living, despite June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected drop in inflation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. She says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little to cheer in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation numbers show CPI inflation rising from 0.5% in June 2016 to 2.6% a year later - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than a five-fold increase in only a year. While inflation has eased back from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading of 2.9%, thanks largely to a fall in the oil price driving down the cost of fuel, this will be cold comfort for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash strapped consumers - inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target rate and outpacing our earnings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth figures show regular pay growing at just 2.0% for the three months to May, confirming that our pay packets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping up with rising prices despite the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate reaching its lowest level since 1975. This is tightening the squeeze on UK households, which is bad news for an economy that relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services. Retail sales figures out on Thursday will provide a telling health check on just how spending is fairing given the mounting pressure on British households. No prizes for spotting the moment that the inflation data was released..... Katie Schmuecker of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says the inflation squeeze is hitting poorer Britons the hardest: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t celebrating the drop in inflation. She points out that Britons are still suffering from falling real wages, and urges the government to ditch its 1% cap on public sector pay rises. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must stop this cost of living squeeze. Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Robert Peston reckons that inflation has been dampened by the slowing UK economy: This is the biggest drop in inflation in over two years, points out Jamie McGeever of Reuters: Kevin Maguire of the Mirror points out that the retail prices index (another measure of inflation) hit 3.5% in June: This chart shows how the cost of transport, and recreation activities, both dropped last month: Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June 2017, the fourth successive month of price decreases. There was also a 0.1% drop in recreation - which includes cultural services, and games, toys and hobbies. However, as you can see, food, furniture and household goods all got more expensive during June. And on an annual basis, almost everything is more expensive than a year ago: The pound has fallen sharply since the inflation data was released, shedding all this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Sterling has dropped to $1.3028, almost a cent lower. City traders think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less chance of an early rise in UK interest rates. This is the first time UK inflation has fallen since last October. This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) had rising pretty steadily since last summer: The drop in inflation last month is mainly due to falling petrol prices, says the Office for National Statistics. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen to 2.6% in June, down from 2.9% in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller reading than expected; City has expected inflation to remain at last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-year high. But it still means that living standards are being squeezed, as wages are only rising by 2% (according to the latest data, released last week). More to follow! Tension is rising in the City, as traders get ready for the inflation figures to hit the wires.... If inflation remains at a four-year high of 2.9% in June, or even goes higher, it will intensify the debate about when UK interest rates should rise (for the first time since 2007). Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former members of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate setting monetary policy, (and long-term opponents in economic theory) have been outlining their differing views on the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Radio 4 Today programme. Sentance says the Bank should follow the US Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s example and raise rates immediately: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think inflation is going to go up eventually this year to over 3% and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s squeezing the living standards of workers and people throughout the economy and I think the worry that I would have is that the bank of England hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t responded at all to this situation. It can do something about it. If it gradually raised interest rates that would help support the value of the pound so we would get less imported inflation and that might take some of the pressure off consumers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Blanflower on the other hand thinks a rate rise now would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-inflicted wound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here Andrew goes again he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been saying the same thing for the last 10 years. This is precisely the wrong thing to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why would you want to have a self-inflicted wound at a time when Brexit negotiations is taking place, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve no idea how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be resolved and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously a big problem, firms are sitting thinking what the heck is going to happen. So if you start to raise rates now this is precisely the wrong time to do it. Waiting and watching is sensible. My suspicion is this inflation is temporary and it will start to drop away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zing! The pound just hit a fresh 10-month high against the US dollar. Sterling nudged $1.3126 for the first time since September 2016, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare setbacks continue to weaken the dollar. City broker Panmure Gordon hopes that the worst of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation surge may be coming to an end. They told clients this morning that the jump in import prices, following the Brexit vote, seems to have peaked a few months ago. That should mean that inflationary pressures ease a little. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snapshot of their note: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some useful charts on inflation: Some City economists have predicted that UK inflation could rise to 3% this morning. If so, that could send the pound soaring as it would intensify the pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: If headline inflation hits 3% or above, this will indicate a high chance of hiking rates when the BoE meets in August. However, if the numbers pull back, this would ease pressure on the central bank and traders will turn their attention to the Brexit talks. The pound has risen over $1.31 in early trading, up almost half a cent. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-month high, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report. Most currencies are gaining ground against the US dollar this morning, after president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to shake up America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare system hit another roadblock. Overnight, two senators declared they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to repeal Obamacare. So, with veteran lawmaker John McCain recovering from surgery, the Republicans simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the votes....especially as some senators fear that millions of Americans, especially with pre-existing conditions, would suffer if the Affordable Care Act was repealed. This has hurt the dollar, as it undermines hopes that Trump could deliver tax reforms or a big new infrastructure spending programme. This has sent the euro rallying to its highest level against the US dollar since May 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The cost of living squeeze is one of the hottest topics in Britain today, thanks to the decline in the pound last year and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector pay squeeze. So the main event today is the latest inflation figures, due at 9.30am today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all-but-certain to show that prices are rising faster than wages. Economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index will hit 2.9% for June, matching May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. That would mean that real wages are continuing to shrink, as basic pay is currently only growing by 2% per year. Prices are being driven up by the slump in the pound last June, which makes imports much dearer. So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will also show the impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics predicts that food prices drove inflation up last month: Inflation has surged over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official target of 2% in recent months, as our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Inflation was running at 0.6% when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but it has risen subsequently as a result of higher oil prices and dearer imports caused by the 12% decline in the value of the pound over the past 12 months. That has taken the annual inflation rate to its highest level in four years and close to the level where Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, would be forced to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street had failed to keep the annual increase in the cost of living to within one percentage point of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preview: The ONS will also publish its latest house price index, which may show that prices rose at a slower pace in May. And over at Winchester cathedral, the Bank of England is preparing to unveil the final design of its new polymer \u00c2\u00a310 note.

                "bodyText":"With little in the way of real economic news, and with interest meetings from the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank due on Thursday, investors were in a cautious mood again. Even so, markets managed to move in the right direction. In Europe, they were lifted by a dip in the euro ahead of the ECB gathering, while in the US a stronger oil price helped to lift Wall Street. The technology heavy Nasdaq index even hit a new high, boosted by another move higher from Netflix. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 40.69 points or 0.55% at 7430.91 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.17% at 12,452.05 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.83% to 5216.07 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 0.57% to 21,478.95 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.6% at 10,588.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.64% to 853.54 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 26 points or 0.12% higher. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, is also cautious about the fall in US oil inventories: US crude stocks posted their third greater than expected inventories drawdown today, as the effects of driving season continue to be felt. It is worth being careful to not read too much into recent US stockpile reductions, as seasonality effects typically see US drivers raise both mileage and air conditioning usage. News that Chinese demand is on the wane is certainly not what the bulls want to hear, and despite falling US stocks, we continue to see output rise globally irrespective of the conformity rate of the recent OPEC production quota. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: WTI and Brent Crude oil surged higher after the oil inventory report showed a larger than expected decline. The energy information agency (EIA) revealed that US stockpiles of oil fell by 4.72 million barrels, and the consensus was for a 3.5 million barrel decline. Last week there was drop of 7.56 million barrels. Traders would be unwise to overlook the fact that US oil production increased by 32 thousand barrels per day. US crude stocks fell by more than expected last week, giving some support to the oil price. Crude inventories dropped by 4.7m barrels compared to forecasts of a 3.2m barrel fall, while gasoline stocks were 4.4m barrels lower. Analysts had expected a decline here of 655,000. The news saw Brent crude jump 1.33% to $49.49 a barrel, a two week high. Credit Suisse has sent a shiver through the City this afternoon, by warning that Britain is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflirting with recession\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In a new research note, Credit Suisse argues there is a roughly one-in-three chance that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy falls into recession later this year, as the economy continues to slow. Credit Suisse estimates that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures will show that the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in April-June, matching the poor performance in the first three month of 2017. For the rest of the year, it expect growth to remain subdued at 0.2%-0.3% per quarter. And raises the prospect of a full-blown technical recession, defined as two quarters of negative growth in a row. Credit Suisse believes this is a real possibility, given the slowdown in consumer spending and the uncertainty created by Brexit. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysts do admit that they predicted an immediate recession if Britain voted to leave the EU. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, of course, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the risk is averted for good. They write: That [a recession] is not our central scenario, but the risks are increasing, and the volatile political backdrop and unpredictable Brexit negotiations have increased the uncertainty of our forecasts. The reasons for expecting a recession post the EU referendum in the UK continue to haunt the economy. We acknowledge that the recession we forecast in the aftermath of the referendum did not occur. But the channels that we thought would drive negative growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an inflation-driven squeeze on consumer spending and weaker business investment as a result of Brexit uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are materializing, albeit later than we expected. We think those drivers are only likely to worsen as political uncertainty persists after the election and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with Europe remains unclear. They also single out the slide in real wages in recent months: Over in New York, shares have hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq, both pushed higher. Over in the US, there are some upbeat housing numbers in the wake of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in housebuilder confidence. Housing starts in June rose by 8.3% compared to expectations of a 6.2% increase. This means new houses are being built at the fastest rate in four months. Meanwhile May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was revised from a 5.5% fall to a 2.8% decline. Although Glaxo is selling Horlicks in the UK, it is retaining its Indian operation where the malted drink is growing more popular by the day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Reuters, which explains: In Britain, where Horlicks is sold as a bedtime drink, the product has largely fallen out of favour and sales are very limited. Indian demand for Horlicks, by contrast, is strong and GSK has developed the malted barley milk drink into its top consumer brand in the country. Glaxo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to abandon plans to build a new factory in Cumbria is a major blow to the area. Five years ago, GSK announced it would create a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state-of-the-art biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Ulverston. The site was expected to cost around \u00c2\u00a3350m, and create 500 permanent jobs. At the time, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent news for Cumbria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A major investment that will create many highly-skilled jobs and provide a huge boost to the area.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But those hopes have now been thrown into uncertainty. Breaking: Pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline is cutting more than 300 jobs in the UK. The company has announced details of a plan to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improve the efficiency and competitiveness of its manufacturing network\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Under the scheme, Glaxo will sell its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHorlick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 brand in the UK, and shut the factory in Slough where the malt milk drink is produced. GSK is also outsourcing some manufacturing activity at its Worthing site in the UK. And in another blow, the company is abandoning plans to build a biopharmaceutical facility in Ulverston, Cumbria, as it no longer needs the additional capacity. Local MP John Woodcock says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcterrible news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Glaxo insists that it remains committed to UK manufacturing, and is today pledging an extra \u00c2\u00a3140m for sites in Hertfordshire, County Durham and Montrose, in Scotland. It says: This new investment is in addition to the \u00c2\u00a3275million announced last year and investment of over \u00c2\u00a31.2billion in UK manufacturing since 2012. It also points out that it is a major employer: Overall, GSK employs a total of around 17000 people across the UK of which 5000 are in UK manufacturing operations. The proposals announced today for Worthing and Slough will result in a reduction of approximately 320 permanent jobs over the next 4 years. Is it Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault? Apparently not. Glaxo says: None of the announcements made today by the company have resulted from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union. Morgan Stanley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results have cheered the markets: Newsflash from Wall Street: Morgan Stanley has become the latest bank to warn that bond trading has struggled. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the bank beating expectations with its financial results for the last quarter.... MS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net earnings rose to $1.8bn for the April-June quarter, up from $1.6bn a year ago. That equates to earnings of 87 cents per share, compared to forecasts of just 76 cents CEO James Gorman says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent performance, given the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubdued\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trading conditions. And those \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubdued\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conditions seem to have hit in MS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond trading division. Fixed income sales and trading net revenues fell to $1.2bn, from $1.3bn, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower volatility and sporadic activity during the quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs reported a 40% slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, which was also blamed on the current environment of low volatility. Over in Paris, the governor of the Bank of France has dropped a hint that the ECB will take a cautious approach at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Villeroy de Galhau, who serves on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council, told French MPs that the central bank has defeated the threat of deflation. However, he added, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to end its asset purchase scheme or raising interest rates from their current record lows. De Galhau argued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have made progress, but we have not yet reached the target and so there is still a need for our accommodative monetary policy... We are adapting its intensity depending on the economic situation and progress towards the target. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo from the session: European stock markets have crept higher, helping to keep global stocks at record levels. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 6 points, with Reckitt Benckiser leading the way following the sale of its food business. That follows a decent session on Wall Street last night, where the Nasdaq tech index surged to a fresh record high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are hoping that the European Central Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop any nasty surprises tomorrow: A record high for the Nasdaq and a fresh overnight surge in the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing rally will be the key themes on an otherwise relatively quiet day. As the ECB meeting gets closer, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention will increasingly focus on the likelihood of any further hawkish commentary from the central bank that could squeeze the euro even higher against the dollar. European markets failed to capitalise on last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, hamstrung by euro strength, so the hope for this particular crowded trade is that Mario Draghi will row back on the change in language from earlier in the month. Given the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predilection for easing, it seems unlikely that they will err too much on the hawkish side. Quite.... Newsflash: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector cooled a little in May. Construction output across the eurozone shrank by 0.7%, compared to May, due to a 0.9% decline in civil engineering and a 0.7% drop in building construction by 0.6%. Across the wider EU, construction dropped by 1.1%. Eurostat explains: The largest decreases in production in construction were recorded in Slovenia (-10.6%), Sweden (-7.1%) and Slovakia (-4.9%), and the highest increases in Hungary (+7.6%), Bulgaria (+3.6%) and Italy (+2.7%). Despite the month-on-month decline, eurozone construction production was still 2.6% higher than a year ago: This may encourage the European Central Bank not to rush into unwinding its stimulus programme.... Hot news for sauce lovers! Consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser has sold off its food business in a deal worth $4.2bn (\u00c2\u00a33.2bn). The division, which produces French\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mustard, Franks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 RedHot and Cattlemen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sauces, has been gobbled up by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s McCormick &amp; Co - which owns Schwartz herbs and spices. This follows a bid battle with Unilever and Hormel Foods, maker of Spam. The deal should allow Reckitt to focus on its cleaning and healthcare operations. Shares in the company have jumped 1.5%. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank predicts that the Bank of Japan will reaffirm its commitment to loose monetary policy when it monetary policy meeting ends tomorrow. The BoJ is currently buying 80 trillion yen of bonds each year, hitting banks with negative interest rates, and trying to keep long-term government borrowing costs around zero, in a bid to drive inflation and growth up. But with inflation still weak, Rosenstreich doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the BoJ can consider slowing its stimulus programme yet. While most major central banks have begun tightening money supplies, the BoJ has not. The Central bank has been unable to boost inflation to its target of 2%, and success is not in sight for 2017-2018. The Bank is likely to focus on controlling the yield curve, one of its primary targets will be to pin 10-year government bond yields at 0%.... Rosenstreich adds that two hawkish BoJ policymakers are leaving the board, giving governor Haruhiko Kuroda more freedom to continue his expansive policy. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market had a good day, driven by its banks. Shares in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lenders rallied after regulators unveiled new capital requirements which are less onerous than feared. Bloomberg has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new requirements look relatively benign,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anthony Ip, a credit analyst at Citigroup Inc. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The majors may well be able to meet the new requirements organically without equity raisings, assets sales or changes to dividends.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ Bank shares rose as much as 4.2 percent, the most in more than eight months, and Commonwealth Bank added 3.4 percent. National Australia Bank rallied as much as 3.7 percent and Westpac climbed as much as 4 percent. That sent the S&amp;P/ASX index up by 0.8% The euro is dipping this morning, down 0.2% against the pound at 88.4p. That suggests that traders expect the European Central Bank to calm expectations that it might rein in its stimulus programme soon, at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING, believes the ECB have had a rethink after president Draghi gave an upbeat speech in late June. Those upbeat comments drove the euro up, and sparked a selloff in eurozone government bonds. Schroeder adds (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A strong euro has also raised expectations that they will not sound overly hawkish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness has boosted the Chinese yuan. Beijing just fixed its currency at the strongest level in nine months, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare woes continue to weigh on the greenback. This news clearly calls for a cute panda... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an end of term feeling in the markets today. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any traders have actually turned up with a Kerplunk set, but they could be forgiven for risking a quick game of Top Trumps across their trading terminals. In short, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much going on today. So with nothing to scare investors right now, global markets remain at their highest ever levels. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gauge of shares around the world has risen this morning, putting it on track for its fifth daily rise in a row. But although the summer lull is nearly upon us, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there quite yet, class. Investors need to prepare for a busy Thursday, when the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank both hold monetary policy meetings. They could move move the markets, if policymakers offer any hints that monetary policy will be tightened soon. In particular, the ECB could provide fresh guidance on when it will start to taper its bond purchase scheme. Any bullish comments from president Draghi could send the euro spiking. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: Any comments which are perceived are more hawkish then expected could result in further pressure on the US dollar. The dollar is also weaker against the yen and the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Asia, optimism over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, following this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures, has pushed shares higher. The US dollar is languishing around a 10-month low today, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to get healthcare changes though Congress. Investors are increasingly sceptical that that the president can implement tax reforms or push through a big infrastructure spending bill. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it... The Trump administration is also helping by appearing to undermine the US dollar at every available opportunity with what can only be described as either incompetence or sheer stupidity. Another failure to enact policy reforms this time on health care is raising serious questions as to whether this administration will deliver on any of the promises it made at the end of last year, with serious doubts now being expressed about tax and banking reform. It seems that even with a majority in both Houses the Republicans appear unable to even agree amongst themselves as to what is best for the US economy. It appears that the US government is giving the UK government a run for its money in the incompetence stakes. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help that neither country has a competent opposition to offset this. President Draghi will certainly have his work cut out in keeping a lid on the euro at this rate, as the market gears up for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB rate meeting, with a move to the $1.2000 level a distinct possibility on a break of $1.1620 and last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high. The agenda: It looks like a quiet day, but we do get new eurozone construction figures, US housing data, and new oil inventory figures this afternoon.... 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for May 1.30pm BST: US housing starts and building permits 3.30pm BST: US crude oil inventories",

Indeed, the ECB stressed that it would increase its asset purchase scheme, which currently stands at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn a month, if the inflation picture deteriorated further.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Marchel Alexandrovich</strong>, Chief European Economist at <strong>Jefferies</strong>, insists that nothing has really changed....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In reality, there are no big changes from the June press conference or the keynote speech from a few weeks ago.

In fact, Draghi seems to allow for the possibility that the decision on how to extend QE will not be announced in September, and the exact details may follow later \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 26 October, or even 14 December.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Megan Greene</strong> of <strong>Manulife Asset Management</strong> thinks Draghi played a good game:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/economistmeg/status/888031359092092928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Draghi bought himself tons of wiggle room in both directions (dovish and hawkish).

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW This is also interesting. ECB insiders have told Bloomberg that the much-anticipated decision on the future of its bond-purchase programme might not come until October. A cynic might suggest the ECB didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy seeing the euro rally against the pound and the US dollar (as that weakens inflation), and wanted to recalibrate the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 views..... Now this is interesting..... the ECB have just tweeted a video clip from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the section where Mario Draghi spells out that the ECB needs to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistent and patient, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the dovish message which the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank wants to get across :) Over in Athens, government officials have welcomed Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proclamation that Greece has made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious [fiscal] progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It comes as speculation grows that Greece is close to testing its fortunes in the bond markets. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The leftist-led government announced today that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely monitoring developments in markets \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [and] trends\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in preparation of a market return, possibly as early as next week. When it judged the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moment was appropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it would make the first move, it said. Athens has hired six international banks to oversee the bond sale in what would be its first market foray in three years. The government spokesman Dimitiris Tzanakopoulos has told the Guardian that the country wants to test the ground with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153test exits in order to be able at the end of the programme to finance our debt without official sector support.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout programme, a third financial package of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn euro, expires in August 2018. And in another key development, the IMF has indicated that it is ready to finally approve Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout package. A spokesman said the ultimate goal is to get Greece to return to markets, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153debt sustainability discussion only just starting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an alternative view... City research group Fathom has some late gloomy news; they reckon the chances of a UK recession over the next year is greater than 50%. They cite the slowdown in consumer spending in recent months, as inflation erodes wages. In a new report, they say: Defying widespread expectation of a recession, the UK economy weathered the Brexit storm better than the majority of forecasters, ourselves included, anticipated. That was thanks, in large part, to the strength of consumer spending. But that tide has since turned: the brief period of real wage growth is over; household finances are stretched; and June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive general election has reignited concerns about the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. With the key driver of UK GDP growth, the consumer, under assault, we believe that there is now a greater-than-evens chance of a technical recession in the UK over the next year. The pound has hit an eight month low against the euro. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for British holidaymakers planning a trip to Europe this summer. Sky News has more details: Sterling slipped close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.11 as the euro strengthened in reaction to remarks by European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi while the UK currency was again buffeted by fears over Brexit. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip - of as much as two cents - took it to its lowest level since November 2016. It will weaken the spending power of British families preparing to flock to Spanish beaches and French campsites when school holidays begin later this week. Ouch! Consumer confidence in the eurozone has fallen unexpectedly. The European Commissions gauge of consumer morale has dropped to minus 1.7, from minus 1.3 in June. Economists had expected it to rise to minus 1.1. I suspect Mario Draghi arrived at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference determined to say as little as possible. And he almost succeeded. Reporters seeking detailed answers on how the ECB might unwind its stimulus programme were met with a firm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discuss that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But one piece of news did slip out - Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge that the ECB will discuss the next stage in its QE programme \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin the autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That promise came with a warning that policymakers must remain prudent, patient and persistent -- which is Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of saying that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to tighten policy today. He insisted that inflation pressures are still weak, and warned that a premature tightening would threaten the whole eurozone recovery. Hardly the words of a full-blown hawk. But the prospect that the ECB might taper its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn/month bond-buying programme in September or October has tantalised investors, sending the euro close to a 16-month high. But that move could be premature, given Draghi insisted that inflation pressures remain subdued and that a substantial stimulus is still needed. What the experts say.... Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Draghi sounded dovish today: The key takeaway from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is that a September taper announcement looks increasingly unlikely as the ECB said that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial degree of accommodation is needed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to boost inflation, and that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme will run until the inflation rate picks up. Since core inflation remains at 1.1%, well below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target rate, this suggests that QE has further to go. Indeed, the ECB stressed that it would increase its asset purchase scheme, which currently stands at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn a month, if the inflation picture deteriorated further. Marchel Alexandrovich, Chief European Economist at Jefferies, insists that nothing has really changed.... In reality, there are no big changes from the June press conference or the keynote speech from a few weeks ago. And the overall message is that while the economy is recovering, inflation will only return to target as long as the ECB maintains its accommodative policy stance. But Draghi is also making sure that the markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get ahead of themselves and start pricing in QE adjustment before the ECB settles on the right policy path. In fact, Draghi seems to allow for the possibility that the decision on how to extend QE will not be announced in September, and the exact details may follow later \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 26 October, or even 14 December. Megan Greene of Manulife Asset Management thinks Draghi played a good game: But Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, says Draghi failed to keep the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value down. Draghi did his best this afternoon to cap the euro, failing quite spectacularly! During his press conference, the ECB President noted that officials were unanimous in not outlining a timeframe on tapering, stating the Central Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwas not there yet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Many would have seen this in a dovish light and possibly bearish for the single currency, but much the opposite appears to be taking place. And finally.... Q: are you worried that areas of the eurozone economy which have benefitted from your stimulus programme will struggle when it is taken away? That goes beyond our remit, Draghi replies. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference, a good 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. School is out for the summer! Q: Does September 7th count as the autumn? [ie, could a decision on tapering QE come at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting?] Haha, says Draghi. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly why we have kept our plans vague, and only agreed to discuss QE sometime in the autumn, he replies. Q: Does the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target need to be rethought, given the failure to hit it? Draghi points out that most top central banks aim for an inflation rate of around 2%. Six million jobs have been created since the stimulus programme was created - that shows how successful it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been. How credible would an institution be if it just changed an objective every time it struggled to reach it, he continues, before warning that it would be very destabilising to consider adjusting the inflation target now. Q: Might the ECB change its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapital key\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rules (which dictate how many bonds it can buy from each eurozone country)? We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed that, says Draghi (this is his theme for the day) Q: Will you have concrete options on the table for a possible QE exit in time for your next meeting, in September? Or would you only take the decision to task staff to do that work at September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting? And.... secondly, what are the chances that you have to change your QE programme again, to ensure there are enough bonds to buy? The answer to the second question is that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discuss it, and for the first question too, says Draghi tetchily. The euro has jumped while Draghi is speaking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 0.5% today at $1.155, having been a cent lower earlier. This may be triggered by Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment that the ECB will discuss how to proceed with its QE programme in the autumn..... Q: Have you asked staff to look at the technical details of QE after December (when the current programme expires)? No, says Draghi. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been discussed, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not been tasked. Q: Several ECB appointments have been overturned in the last year, and your own advisor is being challenged - so what can you do to improve hiring practices? We are grateful when mistakes are caught, says Draghi, before adding that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when these issues are discussed in the media. Q: Greece wants to return to the financial markets, so how confident are you that the ECB will include Greece in your QE programme, and buy its government bonds? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the Greek government to decide whether to tap the markets, says Draghi. He points out that Bank of Greece has expressed some concern about the plan, but also acknowledges that there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Greece. The governing council trusts the strength and the power of its monetary package in all its elements, says Draghi firmly. We still stay in the market for a long time, he adds. Is he channelling Darth Vader?! Q: You sound more dovish on inflation than in your speech in Sintra last month, so how do you see inflation rising to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target? Draghi insists that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little difference between today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, and the Sintra speech (when he said that inflationary pressures had replaced deflationary ones). It is going to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the factors holding down inflation to weaken, but it will happen, he pledges. Q: Is the ECB worried about triggering a taper tantrum, like the US Federal Reserve experienced, when it slows its bond-buying programme? Inflation is not where we want it to be, nor where it should be, Mario Draghi replies firmly. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why a substantial degree of accommodative monetary policy is still needed. He strikes an upbeat tone, saying that the eurozone is now enjoying a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recovery. We only have to wait for wages and prices to follow course. The last thing the Governing Council wants is an untimely tightening that slows down this process, or even jeopardises it. Onto questions. Q) Did the ECB discuss what changes it would make to its asset purchase scheme after December? We reviewed the economic and financial developments in the euro area, says Draghi. That included the improved economic recovery and the lack of any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convincing sign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a pick-up in core inflation. The broad message is that we must be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Persistent and patient, and prudent, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Draghi, reiterating points he made last month at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forum in Sintra. Draghi also revealed that the governing council was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unanimous in setting no precise date on when to discuss changes in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, our discussions should take place in the fall, or in the autumn as we are in Europe. Q) Are you concerned that the euro has strengthened since your speech in Sintra last month, and are those gains excessive? The repricing of the exchange rate has received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some attention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi replies smoothly. As usual, Draghi ends his statement by urging eurozone politicians to implement structural reforms. The risks to the growth outlook in the eurozone are broadly balanced, Draghi continues. But this growth has not yet translated into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstronger inflation dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says -- pointing out that headline inflation is dampened by weak energy prices. So, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantial degree of accommodation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is still needed, he declared -- a sign that the ECB isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready to turn off the stimulus taps yet. On the big picture, Draghi says that the global recovery should support trade, and boost eurozone exports. But underlying inflation will probably only rise gradually, meaning that headline inflation will probably remain at current levels in the coming months (it was just 1.3% in June.) Mario Draghi has arrived in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press room, accompanied by vice-president V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio. He begins by confirming that the governing council decided to keep the key interest rates unchanged, and expects them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time - and and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. He also confirms that the ECB expects to keep buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new assets each month until December, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aims. Draghi adds that the QE programme could be increased, in terms of size and/or duration, if needed. (he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically reading out the statement released earlier) A quick newsflash from America - the number of people signing on for jobless benefits has fallen to a nine-week low of 233,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 247,000 last week, and shows the US labor market is still robust. The euro has also dropped 0.3% against the pound, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.127, meaning one euro is worth 88.7p. Alexandra Russell-Oliver of currency trading firm Caxton says the euro could fall further once Mario Draghi speaks. But in the longer term, it is likely to gain value. She says: The press conference will be key as traders seek clues as to the timing of the winding down of stimulus. ECB President could strike a more cautious tone to avoid adding further fuel to the speculative fire, which may weaken the euro. Ultimately, the expected winding down of stimulus will likely continue to be supportive of the euro.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mario Draghi will explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions to the press pack in Frankfurt shortly. You can watch the press conference live, here: (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also embedded this at the top of the blog) Kathleen Brooks of City Index says anticipation is building on the trading floors.... The key takeaway from the press conference for us will be how Draghi justifies his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hawkish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talk in Sintra late last month when he mentioned the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and euro bulls ran with it. Considering there are still no signs of reflation and the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement is still as dovish and QE-supporting as ever, will Draghi backtrack? Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of investment game app invstr, says Mario Draghi is keen not to roil the markets today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the possibility of an unlikely interest rate hike is slowly growing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that Mario Draghi has opted to keep European Central Bank rates unchanged for now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite some evidence that monetary stimulus has been working, the fact that inflation in the eurozone slipped back to 1.3% in June suggests that a change now would be unwise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi will have also been mindful of the market overreaction to his speech in Sintra, which saw a surge in bond yields and the euro.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement is dovish, simply because the ECB hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed its position on QE. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski agrees: Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever points out that this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement is virtually identical to June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one (except this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting took place in Frankfurt, not Tallinn). Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the ECB will change policy in September The euro has dipped following the ECB announcement, down 0.3% at $1.148. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the governing council didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop its pledge to boost its stimulus programme in the future, if needed. Importantly, the European Central Bank has not decided to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 its stimulus scheme today. Instead, the central bank has repeated its pledge to keep buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new bonds each month until the end of this year. It is also sticking to its promise to extend the programme if needed - a dovish signal. The ECB says: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB has repeated its pledge to keep borrowing costs at their record low \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and well past the horizon when it stops buying new assets through its QE programme. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged, at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. That means that: The headline interest rates remains at its current record low of 0.0%. Eurozone banks will still be charged 0.4% to leave money at the ECB, rather than lending it. Eurozone banks will also be charged 0.25% to borrow from the ECB. More to follow.... We may have a winner... There are just 30 minutes to go until the European Central Bank announces this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision (followed by Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference 45 minutes later) Naeem Aslam of Think Markets predicts a cautious performance from the ECB president: The panic could only be if the ECB drops some unexpected surprise in the market and the chances of that are very low. We expect the ECB to be very subtle in their approach and the main agenda for them would be to reinforce their forward guidance. What we do want to hear from the ECB is that the policy members have discussed the topic of tapering. In the meantime, Alberto Gallo of Algebris Investment is playing the traditional game trying to guess Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tie colour (possibly a guide to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood...) More alarming figures from Greece have been released this morning, showing that the net worth of Greek households fell by a staggering 40% between 2009, when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt drama erupted, and 2014. Helena Smith reports from Athens The figures released by the Bank of Greece are further proof of just how much the disposable income of Greek households has shrunk since the start of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis. Bank researchers, releasing the findings, said the net worth of average households contracted from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac108,649 in 2009 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65,030 in 2014. There drop in poorer households was even more dramatic with some suffering a loss of 70.8% in net wealth over the same period. The leftist-led government has announced it will be taking measures to alleviate the hardships of those worse hit by the rigours of austerity - the price of three emergency bailout programmes for the debt stricken country since May 2010. With the Brexit clock ticking, Deutsche Bank has told its staff that it is preparing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU. That will means that some operations are shifted out of London and transferred to Frankfurt. Bloomberg has the details: Deutsche Bank is preparing for a hard Brexit and will probably book the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vast majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its assets in Frankfurt, Chief Executive Officer John Cryan tells employees in a videotaped message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an awful lot of detail to be ironed out and agreed; depending on what the rules and regulations turn out to be, we will try to minimize disruption for our clients and for our own people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cryan says in the video. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But inevitably roles will need to be either moved or at least added in Frankfurt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound jumped back over $1.30 when the retail sales figures hit the wires, but the rally didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have legs. Sterling is now back at $1.2960, down over half a cent today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains why: Although the bounce in sales last month was a welcome development, it still means that for the first half of the year retail sales will be relatively flat, and may only contribute 0.1% to Q2 GDP. This does not bode well for the UK growth outlook, which is one reason why the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction has been muted. Thus, unless we see retail sales rise consistently in the coming months, which could be a big ask as we get deeper into Brexit negotiations that may trigger consumer uncertainty, then second half growth could be hindered, limiting the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chance of a meaningful rally. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth remembering that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures are partly based on credit. The latest figures from the Bank of England showed that unsecured consumer credit , such as credit cards, jumped by 10.3% in the year to May, five times as fast as the growth rate of earnings. Dr Rebecca Harding, the CEO of Equant Analytics, thinks this is an important factor: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that UK consumer spending will remain subdued for many months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The volume of retail sales has been quite volatile from month to month over the first half of this year. There was a recovery in June from a disappointing May, perhaps supported by warmer weather. But, over the past three months, the level of retail spending adjusted for inflation is no higher than it was in the final quarter of last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending has stalled, after a period of strong growth - with retail sales volumes increasing by 4.4% a year in the three years 2014-16. Rising inflation, driven by a weak pound, has squeezed the purchasing power of consumers. We should expect this subdued pattern of retail sales and consumer growth to continue in the second half of this year and into early 2018. Despite June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival, UK retail sales have actually been flattish since the start of 2017. Kate Davies, Office for National Statistics Senior Statistician, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures show overall growth. A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales for the month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking at the quarterly data, the underlying trend as suggested by the three-month on three-month movement is one of growth, following a fall in quarter 1, suggesting a relatively flat first half of 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some useful charts too: Ana Boata, European Economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, fears that retailers face a challenging time: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High levels of competition, increasing market share moving to discounters and an online shopping frequency more than twice the European average have already made the UK retail one of the most challenging in the world. This is before the loss in households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power and the rise in import costs are added to the mix. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Net gearing ratios in the sector increased by more than 10pp to 66 per cent last year, while average profits (EBIT) slipped by 1.4pp to 5.6 per cent. In addition, the rise in import costs adds pressures on the already deteriorating profitability. Such signals of deterioration in financial health suggest greater pressure on cash flow and payment terms throughout the retail supply chain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pressure on consumers is impacting the sector as retail sales have slowed over the last several months. UK household savings are now at the lowest level in 50 years and are equivalent to a level registered in the US in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. This, plus falling regular earnings when adjusted for inflation, allude to an extremely challenging environment for retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking! UK retail sales grew faster than expected in June, as warmer weather sent Brits racing to the shops. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has just reported that the amount of stuff bought in the shops last month rose by 0.6%. The City had expected a 0.4% gain, following a 1.2% decline in May. It suggest that consumer spending is holding up, even though rising inflation is eating into household incomes. Her are the key points from the ONS: In the 3 months to June 2017, the quantity bought (volume) in the retail industry is estimated to have increased by 1.5%, with increases seen across all store types. The growth for Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2017 follows a decline of 1.4% in Quarter 1 (Jan Mar) 2017, meaning we are broadly at the same level as at the start of 2017. Compared with May 2017, the quantity bought increased by 0.6%, with non-food stores providing the main contribution. Feedback from retailers suggests that warmer weather in addition to the introduction of summer clothing helped boost clothing sales. Average store prices (including petrol stations) increased by 2.7% on the year following a rise of 3.2% in May 2017; the fall is a consequence of slowing fuel prices. Online sales (excluding automotive fuel) increased year-on-year by 15.9% and by 1.8% on the month, accounting for approximately 16.2% of all retail spending. The pound has lost ground in early trading, dropping 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2985. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping to push shares higher in London, where the FTSE 100 is up 31 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggle to get inflation up to its 2% targetL Still, perhaps a bit more stimulus will work.... In the City, shares in Sports Direct have jumped by 7% this morning, despite reporting a 60% slump in profits in the last year. Sports Direct suffered after failing to hedge itself sufficiently against the slump in the pound. But founder Mike \u00e2\u20ac\u0153power drinker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley insists that the business is improving. He told investors that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sports Direct is on course to become the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Selfridges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of sport by migrating to a new generation of stores to showcase the very best products from our third party brand partners. We have invested over \u00c2\u00a3300m in property over the last year, and I am pleased to report that early indications show that trading in our new flagship stores is exceeding expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The City should also be reassured to see that Sports Direct has appointed a new full time chief finance officer, filling a four-year (!) vacancy. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale predicts that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank press conference will be dominated by questions about how, and when, it will exit its stimulus programme. While acknowledging the strength of the economy, Draghi is likely to counter any ideas of an imminent and rapid path towards ending QE, instead urging patience with the still-subdued inflation outlook. We maintain our call for an announcement in September of a six-month extension of the APP into 2018 at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn/month, followed by data-dependent quarterly reductions. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says Mario Draghi will be desperate to avoid driving the euro higher today. The last thing the ECB wants is a strong Euro and tightened financial conditions for now. It is a complicated process to start normalizing policy without disrupting markets, so while Draghi wants to prepare investors for a gradual wind-down of asset purchases, he is likely to hint that the pace will be gradual and easing options will remain open. The trickiest part is how to deliver a confident message without leading to further selloffs in bonds and stocks and additional appreciation in the Euro. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services suspects the ECB will resist pressure to trim its stimulus programme today, but may get the ball rolling.... What may be announced at the meeting is that various ECB departments and committees will be given the task of exploring the best methodology, with a decision deferred until September, when it will also have an updated set of staff forecasts. Marc also expects president Draghi will return to the themes covered in that speech in Sintra last month, when he said the eurozone recovery was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening and broadening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given the market furore around Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflationary forces displacing deflationary forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he will surely want to clarify precisely what he meant, and most likely qualify those comments by suggesting that core CPI is far from displaying a sustainable uptrend that would see headline CPI heading towards the ECB target of close to 2.0%, even if the disinflationary threat has passed. And Mike Bird of the WSJ reports that anticipation is building up nicely... Please insert your own joke about surprise liquidity injections.... Haruhiko Kuroda has just denied that the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has lost credibility by pushing its inflation target back again today. The BoJ governor is giving a press conference now, and pointed out that other central banks have also pushed back their own inflation targets. Kuroda reiterated that the risks to inflation and economic growth are to the downside, and put some blame on companies for being too cautious to raise prices. And crucially, he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out increasing the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme, if needed. Overnight, the Bank of Japan has decided to maintain its huge stimulus programme - and admitted that it is struggling to get inflation up. Following its policy meeting, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank on Thursday cut its inflation forecasts for the next few years. It now admits it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit its 2% target until 2020, despite having thrown trillions of new yen into the money supply in recent years. This is a blow to governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical attempts to stimulate inflation by buying a staggering 80 trillion yen of bonds each year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around \u00c2\u00a3550bn) But the BoJ is pressing on with the stimulus programme, keeping overnight interest rates at minus 0.1%, and capping 10-year bond yields at about zero per cent. In a statement, the BoJ admitted that it is struggling to drive earnings higher, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent price developments have been relatively weak, as companies remained cautious in raising wages and prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risks to the economy and price outlook are skewed to the downside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is the SIXTH time that the BoJ has pushed back its inflation target, since Kuroda launched his huge asset-buying program in 2013. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. To taper, or not to taper? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the question on the lips of European Central Bank policymakers today as they hold their final monetary policy meeting before the summer holidays. With Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy strengthening, hawks on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council will be pushing their colleagues to consider trimming (or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctapering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) their stimulus programme. That programme is currently mopping up \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of bonds each month with newly minted money, and investors around the globe are desperate to know how, and when, the ECB might wind it down. BUT.... the ECB needs to tread cautiously, for fear of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper tantrum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Bond prices gyrated alarmingly last month when president Mario Draghi gave a confident speech which seemed to hint that policy would be tightened soon. Most economists expect the governing council to postpone any decision on tapering until their September meeting. But you never know.... Assuming the ECB don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any policy changes today, the big moment will be Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference at 1.30pm BST. Expect the euro to be volatile. Any hint of imminent tapering would send the currency soaring, while a dovish performance from Draghi could sink it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently trading at $1.152, close to an eight-month high. Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, when new retail sales figures for June are released. The City expects a small rise in spending, after sales fell unexpectedly in May. Consumer good giant Unilever, UK retailers Sports Direct and Mothercare, banknote maker De La Rue, and energy provider SSE are all reporting results today. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for June 10am BST: Eurozone deficit figures for Q1 2017 12.45pm BST: ECB interest rate decision announced 1.30pm: ECB holds press conference 1.30pm: US weekly jobless figures 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence figures for July",

                "bodyText":"Another day of thrills and spills is over in the City, and 1% has been wiped off the value of the biggest firms lister in London: Greek bonds rallied today after news of the new debt sale and buyback hit the wires. This has been welcomed by politicians in Athens, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Senior members in the governing Syriza expressed satisfaction at reaction of markets to the news of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prospective foray. Marking the 43rd anniversary of the restoration of democracy to Greece following the collapse of military rule, prime minister Alexis Tsipras highlighted the optimism saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[it] coincides with the decisive restitution of economic stability and the recovery of the country. Now it is the responsibility of all of us to not repeat the mistakes of the past but to build a new Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a great day in the City for shares. The FTSE 100 index is down 86 points, or 1.1% at 7365 points, with most stocks losing ground. The news that the International Monetary Fund had downgraded Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecast this morning weighed on the market. Consumer-focused companies, such as Next, were among the fallers. Exporters also suffered from the recent recovery in the pound, which gained 0.25% to $1.3026 today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE was consistently the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse performer this Monday, dropping nearly 90 points to plunge back below 7400. There were multiple reasons for the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline, from the IMF cutting the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 growth forecasts, to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound and notable losses from the likes of easyJet, Next and Reckitt Benckiser. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to issue fresh bonds for the first time in three years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest from Athens: Another newsflash from America, but this one is less encouraging. The number of home sales slumped by 1.8% in June, suggesting the housing market may be cooling. The annual rate of existing home sales dropped to 5.52m, down from 5.62m in June, and lower than Wall Street expected. Newsflash! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is growing at its fastest pace since January US companies are expanding in July, thanks to a boom in new orders that is driving employment up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest healthcheck on US manufacturing and service sector companies, just released. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash US composite output index has hit 54.2 in July, up from 53.9 in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a six-month high; any reading over 50 shows growth. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the figures show America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is gaining momentum, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not exactly racing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The overall rate of expansion remains modest rather than impressive. The surveys are historically consistent with annualized GDP growth of approximately 2%, but the signs are that growth could accelerate further in coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most encouraging was an upturn in new order inflows to the second-highest seen over the past two years, which helped push the rate of job creation to the highest so far this year, indicative of non-farm payrolls growing at a rate of around 200,000. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The principal weak spot in the economy remained exports, with foreign goods orders dropping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit only marginally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the first time since last September, often blamed on the strength of th Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence believes this bond sale is meant to give Alexis Tsipras some respite from political pressures back home. He writes: The government of Prime Minister Alexi Tsipras is pushing ahead with a bond issue. This is part of an attempt to gain some breathing space amid domestic political problems. The government would like to raise around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4bn; the bond is a switch and tender offer for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn euro-bond issued by the Samaras government in 2014, which matures in April 2019. Athens will also issue new euro-denominated fixed rate notes due in 2022 for cash. The related tender process will take place on 25 July. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syriza party have fallen behind in the polls, with the right-leaning New Democracy opening up a substantial lead.... Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new foray back into the financial markets will play a big role in setting the mood ahead of its expiry of its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout next year. If it attracts strong interest from investors it will play a crucial role in quashing suggestions that the debt-stricken country requires a new credit line, or fourth bailout, at that time to keep default at bay. Instead, those who think a clean exit possible will be strengthened. That was quick! Yanis Varoufakis has hit back at Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism over his tenure as finance minister. In a letter to the Guardian, Varoufakis says: Either I was the right choice to spearhead the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the troika of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders because my plans were convincing, or my plans were not convincing and, thus, I was the wrong choice as his first finance minister. Arguing, as Mr Tsipras does, that I was both the right choice for the initial confrontation and that my plan B was so vague it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the trouble of even talking about is disingenuous, albeit insightful, for it reveals the impossibility of maintaining a radical critique of his predecessors while adopting the Tina (There Is No Alternative) doctrine. More here: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister set the scene for this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sale by telling the Guardian that the worst of the debt crisis was now over. In an interview with my colleague Helena Smith published today, Alexis Tsipras declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can now say with certainty that the economy is on the up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Slowly, slowly, what nobody believed could happen, will happen. We will extract the country from the crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and in the end that will be judged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This interview has caused waves in Greece, where almost the entire media have reproducing excerpts -- including Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concession that he made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since wining power in January 2015. Other highlights include the leftist leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal of his former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Plan B, the contingency programme the self-declared \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erratic Marxist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had prepared in the event of debt-stricken Greece being ejected from the euro. Tsipras broke his silence about Varoufakis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scheme, labelling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weak and ineffective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps the moment will come when certain truths are told ... when we got to the point of reading what he presented as his plan B it was so vague, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the trouble of even talking about,.... It was simply weak and ineffective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In terms of reaction watch this space! This chart shows how Greek bond yields have receded from their crisis-era heights, as confidence has slowly returned. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to buy back some of its existing five-year bonds is good news for investors. Anyone who bought the debt last year, when they traded below their face value, can now sell them back for a profit: The Greek finance ministry has set a goal of a 4.2% interest rate on the bond, reports Helena Smith in Athens. But banking sources believe that will be hard to achieve and say an interest rate of between 4.3% to 4.5% is much more likely. Valuation will take place Tuesday 25th July, our sources add. The test exit is crucial to Greece not only testing markets, from which it has been essentially exiled since the start of its great economic crisis, but weaning itself off borrowed bailout funds. Why is Greece launching a new bond sale now? One reason is that Greek bonds have been strengthening in recent weeks, showing that investors believe the risk of default has fallen. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Alice Gledhill explains: The \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4bn 4.75% 2019 bonds have been trading at a record low yield, bid below 3.5% according to Thomson Reuters prices, making it an opportune time for the country to issue its first deal since 2014.

Six banks have been hired to bring new five-year bonds to the markets, two years after Greece nearly plunged out of the eurozone altogether. Reuters has the details: The Hellenic Republic, rated Caa2/B-/CCC/CCCH, has mandated BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC as joint lead managers for a five-year euro bond, according to a lead. The issue is subject to market conditions and the results of a concurrent switch and tender offer. Greece will be speaking to investors this afternoon, so we should get more details about how much it hopes to borrow, and on what terms. If the sale it successful, it could help Greece to exit its long cycle of austerity and rescue packages. Late last Friday, S&amp;P upgraded its outlook on Greek government debt from stable to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, partly thanks to hopes that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors could finally grant it debt relief. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move comes two weeks after we reported in this blog that the Greek government was planning to return to the markets this summer. The interest rates on Greek bonds has fallen away from their levels at the height of the crisis, fuelling hopes that it could fund itself without the help of painful bailouts. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade growth forecasts have caused a stir in Westminster this morning. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has just issued a statement, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the IMF is yet another blow for the Government and its continued austerity agenda that is holding our country back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It further reveals that this government has no real plan for Brexit and no real plan to deal with the problem of earnings not keeping up with prices, which is undermining growth and risking living standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only a Labour government will end austerity and provide the vital programme of investment to boost growth in our economy, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, which our country desperately needs. And this is from Heidi Alexander MP, leading supporter of Open Britain: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures underline how the uncertainty and loss of confidence caused by the Brexit vote is hampering our economy. If the Government persists with its plan for a hard and destructive Brexit, our growth figures are likely to get even worse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leaving the largest trading bloc in the world for an inferior deal will not be offset by the illusory promise of quick new trade deals with other countries around the world. The result will be less trade that leaves us all poorer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To support our economy and protect jobs, the best deal for Britain will be for us to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, thus continuing to enjoy totally free trade with the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest market on our doorstep.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Have you ever popped a new bag of crisps open, only to find it contains more air than deliciously fried potato? Or found yourself curiously peckish after wolfing down your favourite chocolate bar? If so, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen victim to shrinkflation - the practice where manufacturers quietly cut their product sizes without changing the price. In a new report, the Office for National Statistics shows that more than 2,500 products have shrunk in size over the past five years but prices have stayed the same. Food and drink are particularly vulnerable, perhaps because they are vulnerable to fluctuating commodity costs. The ONS says we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame it on Brexit, though; this phenomenon has existed for a long time. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report explains: Weight changes occur most often in food products rather than any other item category. There are also consistently more reductions across both the food category and non-food items. However, despite some media speculation, there has not been a change in trend since the EU referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our data shows that shrinkflation has been used in practice consistently across the past 5 years. Consumer journalist Harry Wallop has been tweeting some particularly egregious examples: However, the ONS reckons shrinkflation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually undermine its inflation data, as it tracks these changes and adjusts its data accordingly. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts highlight the dangers posed by the Brexit talks, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecast for the UK cut from 2% to 1.7% for the year, this means there is again a focus on the debate about the effect of Brexit on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business. While the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade has been based on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctepid performance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the ultimate impact of Brexit continues to remain unclear. The key factor which threatens to derail the economy and significantly reduce market confidence is the potential for either the Brexit talks collapsing or reaching stalemate. At the moment, there appears to be negligible progress on the talks and the IMF certainly would have factored the risk of talks stalling in reducing their economic growth forecast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy reminder of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF forecast changes: A wave of anxiety is sweeping through Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 index has shed 64 points or 0.9% to 7388. EasyJet is one of the big fallers, down 3%, after rival budget airline Ryanair announced plans for price cuts this summer. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: The FTSE has suffered a rude awakening to the new week, with the gains of last week clearly left in the rear-view mirror. One of the biggest drags we have seen has come from the airline sector, with Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of a potential air fare war in the coming months leading to sharp falls for easyJet and IAG, the owner of airlines including British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. This morning the IMF cut its growth forecast for the UK for the first time since the EU referendum over a year ago. Chief amongst its concerns is the tepid economic performance seen in the first quarter of 2017, with the enactment of Article 50 coinciding with a deterioration in both business and consumer confidence. European markets are also in the red. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 0.5%, dragged by car companies such as Volkswagen and Daimler. That follows reports that the German auto industry colluded in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret technology cartel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the past 20 years. UK businesses should heed the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening, says Markus Kuger, Senior Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade reflects the undercurrent of political and economic uncertainty in the UK, as the impact of Brexit on the economy remains unclear. The first quarter of the year saw a mediocre economic performance and Dun &amp; Bradstreet rates the level of risk in the UK as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The slow progress of Brexit negotiations is creating considerable unpredictability for businesses operating in and with the UK. This has only been intensified by the results of the general election in June, as the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow parliamentary majority is further complicating the process of leaving the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The best advice for businesses is to closely monitor the economic climate and the progress of EU negotiations, and use the latest data and analytics to assess risk and identify potential opportunities. As Brexit negotiations progress organisations should get a clearer picture of the future, but until then careful management of relationships with suppliers, customers, prospects and partners will be key to navigating through these uncertain times.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new growth forecasts are getting plenty of coverage this morning. The Financial Times reports that the Fund expects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadest synchronised upswing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a decade. Better growth in China, the euro zone and Japan is making up for a slower-than-expected US economy and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stalled economic promises as well as a faltering UK, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. In its latest update, the IMF left its April forecasts for 3.5 per cent global growth this year and 3.6 per cent next year unchanged. But the lack of change in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline growth masked what the IMF said was a rotation in the sources of growth. Sky News flag up that the UK has been downgraded, while Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery looks to be gathering pace: The International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% for 2017. The organisation said a weaker than expected performance meant it was revising expectations from the 2% it predicted in April. The US also had its economic forecast downgraded to 2.1% from 2.3%. It comes in contrast to major European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, where growth exceeded expectations. Germany has been revised up by 0.2 points to 1.8%, France by 0.1 points to 1.5%, while Italy and Spain have both been revised up by 0.5 points to 1.3% and 3.1% respectively. Reuters sums up the global picture: The International Monetary Fund kept its growth forecasts for the world economy unchanged for this year and next, although it revised up growth expectations for the eurozone and China. In an updated World Economic Outlook published on Monday, the IMF said global gross domestic product would grow 3.5 percent in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018, unchanged from estimates issued in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While risks around the global growth forecast appear broadly balanced in the near term, they remain skewed to the downside over the medium term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the IMF said in updated forecasts released in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. But...forecasts are made to be missed. Steve Hawkes of The Sun reminds us that the IMF predicted Britain would plunge into recession if it voted to leave the EU..... Ranko Berich of Monex Europe is refreshingly sceptical about the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crystal ball..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone PMI reports: Following one of the best quarters in the past six years, a slowdown in the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pace of expansion was to be expected. Yet, economies in the region continue to grow strongly, and the details of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey point to a continuation of this trend in the coming months. Encouragingly, the recent strength of the Euro does not appear to be cited as a concern at this point with new export order growth in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods producing sector accelerating slightly in July. If sustained, the Euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appreciation may represent a headwind. However, at this stage, we believe it is not enough to derail the recovery in the region and we would expect the ECB to prevent further appreciation if it comes to a point where it jeopardizes the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic momentum. That appreciation has continued this morning, with the euro hitting a two-year high. Breaking: Companies across the eurozone are continuing to expand robustly, although growth has dipped to a six-month low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest healthcheck on the euro area, including this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures from France and Germany. Manufacturing firms led the way, with strong order book growth, rising backlogs and healthy job creation during this month. However... the figures are a little weaker than in the spring. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests Europe is still growing strongly (echoing the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat comments this morning). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The July fall in the PMI indicates that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent growth spurt lost momentum for a second successive month, but still remained impressive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey data are historically consistent with GDP rising at a quarterly rate of 0.6%, cooling slightly from a pace of over 0.7% signalled for the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The slowing pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys and the accompanying easing of price pressures adds to the belief that ECB policymakers will be in no rush to taper policy, and will leave all options open until the central bank sees a clearer picture of the sustainability of the upturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to know for sure whether the economy has merely hit a speed bump or whether the upturn is already starting to fade. The evidence so far points to the former, with the economy hitting bottlenecks due to the speed of the recent upturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forward-looking indicators such as new order inflows remain elevated, suggesting robust growth will be sustained in coming months. Job creation is consequently booming as companies seek to expand capacity in line with growing demand. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash PMIs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have just been released, and they suggest private sector growth has hit a six-month low. Manufacturing and service sector companies in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy reported that activity rose at a slower rate this month. This pulled the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFlash Germany Composite Output Index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down to 55.1 in July, down from 56.4 in June. That suggests Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is growing that the slowest rate since January, after a very strong start to 2017. So what changed this month? Well, Germany companies report that growth in manufacturing output and total new orders slowed this month, even though there is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from customers in both Europe and Asia. Trevor Balchin, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, believes Germany is still enjoying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong underlying growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The easing seen in July follows the strongest quarter in six years, and manufacturing continued to expand at a historically sharp rate. New export order growth in the goods- producing sector accelerated slightly and suppliers remained under substantial pressure. Boom! France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories are enjoying their best month since 2011, thanks to a surge in new orders. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest French PMI report from Markit, just released. Markit found that manufacturing output accelerated to its fastest rate in 75 months, jumping to 55.4 in July from 54.8 in June. Service sector growth slowed a little, sending the services PMI down to 55.9 from 56.9. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates that the French economy is still growing strongly. French companies reported that new business picked up strongly this month, creating larger backlogs of work and encouraging them to take on more staff. Annabel Fiddes, Economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Steep increases in output and employment were key takeaways from the latest release, with manufacturing firms noting the quickest rise in staff numbers for nearly 17 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Further increases in total new orders and backlogs suggest that companies will continue to ramp up output and add to payrolls going forward, and marks a solid start to the second half of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite cutting its UK and US growth forecasts, the IMF still thinks the global recovery is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfirming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it revised up its growth expectations for the eurozone to 1.9% this year, up from 1.7% in April. For China, the IMF expects stronger growth of 6.7% in 2017, up 0.1 percentage point. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecast this year has also been raised, from 1.2% to 1.3%. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Fund says: Growth has been revised up for Japan and especially the euro area, where positive surprises to activity in late 2016 and early 2017 point to solid momentum. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth projections have also been revised up, reflecting a strong first quarter of 2017 and expectations of continued fiscal support. Inflation in advanced economies remains subdued and generally below targets; it has also been declining in several emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and Russia.... Growth projections for 2017 have been revised up for many euro area countries, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, where growth for the first quarter of 2017 was generally above expectations. This, together with positive growth revisions for the last quarter of 2016 and high-frequency indicators for the second quarter of 2017, indicate stronger momentum in domestic demand than previously anticipated. This infographic has more details: The IMF has also cut its growth forecast for the US, having concluded that Donald Trump will struggle to deliver the infrastructure plan he promised. Growth this year has been cut from 2.3% to 2.1%, while 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast has been slashed from 2.5% to 2.1%. It says: While the markdown in the 2017 forecast reflects in part the weak growth outturn in the first quarter of the year, the major factor behind the growth revision, especially for 2018, is the assumption that fiscal policy will be less expansionary than previously assumed, given the uncertainty about the timing and nature of U.S. fiscal policy changes. Market expectations of fiscal stimulus have also receded. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry has responded to the news that the International Monetary Fund have cut their UK growth forecasts this year. A Treasury spokesperson insisted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the fundamentals of our economy are strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that the ongoing Brexit talks are crucial: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This forecast underscores exactly why our plans to increase productivity and ensure we get the very best deal with the EU are vitally important.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A new week brings new concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecasts for UK growth this year, citing recent evidence that the economy is weakening. The IMF now expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP to only expand by 1.7% this year, down from 2% growth forecast in April. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, it suggests that Brexit uncertainty may be hurting the UK. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, pointed to a marked change in early 2017. He said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecast had been lowered based on its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tepid performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far this year, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ultimate impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom remains unclear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF still expect the UK to grow by 1.5% in 2018, but said one key risk facing the global economy was that the Brexit talks would end in failure. But the Fund is rather more optimistic about Europe. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has been revised up by 0.2 points to 1.8%, France by 0.1 points to 1.5%, while Italy and Spain have both been revised up by 0.5 points to 1.3% and 3.1% respectively. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full take: Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy this morning, with the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surveys from data firm Markit. They are expected to show that private sector companies in Germany and France continued to grow strongly this month, after posting their fastest growth since 2011 earlier this year. Royal Bank of Canada say: The day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main data release are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMIs for the euro area, France and Germany. These are the readings for July so will provide an important indication of how the euro area economy has begun Q3. The June readings pointed to a slight loss of momentum at the end of the second quarter but that was coming off their highest level in six years in April and May and, at 56.4, the average composite reading for the quarter was still pointing to activity picking up from Q1. The fall between May and June was attributable to the service sector; by contrast the manufacturing PMI remained comfortably above its long-run average. With other indicators of domestic activity remaining robust we see some scope for the services PMI to recover a little this month and expect it to rise to 55.6 with the manufacturing reading remaining unchanged from its recent elevated level at 57.4. The agenda: 8am BST: French manufacturing and service sector PMI for July 8.30am BST: German manufacturing and service sector PMI for July 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing and service sector PMI for July 2.45pm BST: US manufacturing and service sector PMI for July 3pm: UK home sales for June",

That, in turn, was the result of reform and austerity on the part of the Greek government and signs of an economic recovery.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, McKeown reminds us that we have been here before. That 2014 bond sale was followed by the drama of 2015, when the left-wing Syriza government clashed with creditors and nearly took Greece out of the euro area.</p> <p>Things look somewhat more promising this time around, she continues - Syriza has largely caved in to its creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands and the economy is growing again.</p> <p>But a new government might fall out with Brussels, the ECB and the IMF - creating another crisis. </p> <p>And even if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, the Greek economy remains fragile - and another loan may be needed...</p> <p><strong>McKeown says:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Banks are in a very precarious state, with deposits yet to return and non-performing loans a serious burden. And crucially, the public debt mountain remains huge, at about 180% of GDP. The Greek government might therefore struggle to finance itself even at current market borrowing costs, which remain significantly higher than the average of 1.5% interest that it now pays on its largely officially-held debt. Unless euro-zone creditors agree to much deeper debt relief than that which is now on the table, it seems fairly likely that Greece will require a fourth bailout when the current one expires next August. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:58:13.947Z\">at 4.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59775d02e4b0b17230f38a77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:08:03.415Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jul/25/greece-bond-sale-tsipras-moscovici-uk-industry-business-live?page=with:block-5976fc2ae4b0be0b850d4f3e#block-5976fc2ae4b0be0b850d4f3e\">interrupted his trip to Athens</a> to welcome the bond sale results:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862780635017216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ 2 Greek return to the markets welcomed by financial investors: this is good news &amp; another positive signal of trust in the Greek economy.</p>&mdash; Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862780635017216\">July 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862888407666694\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/2 Let&#39;s prepare the full return to markets in summer 2018! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>&mdash; Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/889862888407666694\">July 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59775d44e4b052d29bd8f81a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:02:16.133Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has hailed the success of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond auction.</p> <h2>Reuters has the details:</h2> <p>Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a beginning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a first sign of confidence in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.</p> <p>He said Greece remained focused on August 2018 to exit its worst crisis in decades. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153From now on, we are focused on August 2018,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos said in a televised statement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that Greek people have suffered a lot, more than they deserved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a second and a third (market foray), to approach August 2018 with confidence and emerge from the bailouts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T15:06:50.807Z\">at 4.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59775799e4b052d29bd8f7f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-25T14:48:53.380Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GREECE PULLS OFF FIRST BOND SALE SINCE 2014</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official!

                "bodyText":"The news that Greece has put its toe back into the financial markets, and not seen it bitten off, helped cheer investors in Europe today. All the main stock markets rallied, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 ending 57 points (0.8%) higher. The euro also gained ground today, hitting a new two-year high against the US dollar at $1.17. Naeem Aslam of Think Market thinks the euro may head higher. The biggest news for the European markets which improved the sentiment among investors was Greece returning to the bond markets. The borrowing cost was much lower purely because the risk level is not the same where it used to be. The Greek news also provided fresh tail wind for the euro which broke its 2015 resistance. Now the route is clear and the target which everyone is looking and talking about is $1.20 against the dollar. A few robust economic readings and some hawkish comments from the ECB would simply do the job. The DAX index particularly performed well today as the result for business confidence surged to a record highs for three months straight. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Journalist Paul Waldie of the Globe and Mail tweets: Dimitri Sofianopoulos, capital markets partner at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auction is a boost for Athens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful return to the capital markets sends a clear signal that the country is finally turning a corner following its recent bailout programme. The level of investor appetite in the bonds will give Greece further confidence in its future finances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics takes a more sceptical approach to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale. She says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into the bond market went \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Greece borrowed at a cheaper rate than in 2014. The sale was well timed, she explains: The return to markets was timed to take advantage of the drop in borrowing costs following the resumption of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout earlier this month. That, in turn, was the result of reform and austerity on the part of the Greek government and signs of an economic recovery. However, McKeown reminds us that we have been here before. That 2014 bond sale was followed by the drama of 2015, when the left-wing Syriza government clashed with creditors and nearly took Greece out of the euro area. Things look somewhat more promising this time around, she continues - Syriza has largely caved in to its creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands and the economy is growing again. But a new government might fall out with Brussels, the ECB and the IMF - creating another crisis. And even if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, the Greek economy remains fragile - and another loan may be needed... McKeown says: Banks are in a very precarious state, with deposits yet to return and non-performing loans a serious burden. And crucially, the public debt mountain remains huge, at about 180% of GDP. The Greek government might therefore struggle to finance itself even at current market borrowing costs, which remain significantly higher than the average of 1.5% interest that it now pays on its largely officially-held debt. Unless euro-zone creditors agree to much deeper debt relief than that which is now on the table, it seems fairly likely that Greece will require a fourth bailout when the current one expires next August. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has interrupted his trip to Athens to welcome the bond sale results: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has hailed the success of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond auction. Reuters has the details: Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a beginning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a first sign of confidence in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. He said Greece remained focused on August 2018 to exit its worst crisis in decades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From now on, we are focused on August 2018,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos said in a televised statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that Greek people have suffered a lot, more than they deserved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a second and a third (market foray), to approach August 2018 with confidence and emerge from the bailouts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! Greece has made a successful return to the financial markets. Athens has sold \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn worth of its new five-year bond, at a yield (or interest rate) or 4.625%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than the 4.95% that Greece last sold five-year bonds for, in 2014. Government officials say that 200 bids were received, a sign that confidence is returning (or that the relatively high yield acted like catnip to investors....) A government official says the sale was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute success\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It reaffirms the positive trajectory of the Greek economy which is making steady steps to exiting crisis and bailout programmes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is already talk of further sales in the months ahead. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout programme expires in summer 2018. Athens is desperate to avoid a fourth rescue deal, so is hoping that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal could be the first step towards gaining market access. But... Greece still has a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 180%, and insists that its official creditors (who hold most of its bonds) must grant it significant debt relief. Boom! US consumer confidence has hit its second highest level since 2000. The monthly measure of American morale, from the Conference Board, has jumped to 121.1 this month from 117.3 in the previous month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a four-month high, and beats Wall Street expectations of 116.5. Separately, US house prices jumped by 5.7% per year in May, according to the latest S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 5.8% in April, but still faster than earnings growth. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit another record high in early trading: Back to Greece....and the latest word is that it has repriced today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale again! The yield (interest rate) on the five-year debt has been trimmed to 4.625%, down from the original goal of 4.875% (which was cut to 4.75% this morning). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that investor are backing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer - as Athens can then cherry-pick the best offers with the lowest yields. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, has welcomed BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision: Just in: BMW has decided to build its fully electric version of the Mini in the UK, ending worries that Brexit drive the project overseas. The German carmaker has announced that the new new battery-electric, three-door hatch will be built at its Cowley plant, on the edge of Oxford, from 2019. The decision follows months of speculation that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impending exit from the EU would deter BMW from investing in the UK. Frank Bachmann, managing director of Plant Oxford, told the Oxford Mail that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is good news for everybody on the team at Plant Oxford and this addition to the model line-up marks an important next step in the evolution of Mini. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the main manufacturer of the Mini three-door, with production expertise built up over many years, it makes sense for us to build this all-electric model. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know that everyone on the plant is looking forward to the project that lies ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Mini will always have a special place in the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart, of course, partly thanks to antics like this... A video clip of Alexis Tsipras meeting commissioner Pierre Moscovici in Athens has now arrived. It shows Tsipras telling Moscovici that this is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special day, the day that Greece is coming back to the markets in a successful way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all hunky dorey in Greece today, reports Helena. Firefighters, demanding renewal of short-term contracts, have been out on the streets protesting this morning. The protestors, some in full rescue gear, demonstrated in front of the Greek parliament in Syntagma square demanding that some 1,320 workers be immediately re-hired. Fire-fighters have been among those affected by the hiring freeze imposed by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors in exchange for emergency bailout funding. If that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad enough .... to the consternation of Greece tourist confederation, striking cultural ministry officials have announced they will close ALL archaeological sites when they walk off the job this weekend. The news has prompted the confederation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head, Yiannis Retsos, to write a letter to the cultural minister, Lydia Koniordou, imploring her to intervene. The 48-hour closure of sites that belong to world heritage will be a huge blow for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation at the height of the tourist season, he argues. Retsos wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cultural treasures, are part of world heritage and one of our competitive tourist advantages. Archaeological sites and museums in Attica and Athens are one of the most basic reasons for the decision to make the journey. For many travellers, visiting the sites is a life goal since they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the opportunity to make such a journey again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicholas Wall, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, says everyone involved in the Greek debt crisis will be crossing their fingers and hoping for a good result today: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, left behind \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccollision economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a long time ago, and has apparently decided that the best strategy for re-election in 2019 is to exit the bailout programme. For this, he needs economic growth, access to markets and cooperation with European partners. A successful Greek exit from the aid programme would also be a boon to European policymakers, who have long faced criticism about their approach to the Greek crisis and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to ask their taxpayers for more cash when this bailout package expires next summer. In this environment, it seems to be in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest for this bond sale to go well. Analysts at Barclays have predicted that Greece will soon receive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief, and (finally) be included in the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying stimulus scheme. In a client note about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale, they say: The IMF Board approved last week in principle a precautionary Stand-by programme (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6bn), to become effective once specific and credible assurances on debt relief are received from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European partners to restore debt sustainability. Public debt in Greece continues to be deemed unsustainable by the IMF without sizeable further debt relief. We do not expect debt relief measures to be delivered by Europe before the German elections (24 September). We also think that specific and credible assurances on debt relief measures are also a necessary condition for the ECB to include GGBs [Greek government bonds] into the PSPP programme, which is our baseline for 2018. The orders are still coming in.... The apparent jump in UK factory output in the last quarter has been welcomed by City experts. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says it could ease concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. However, the EU negotiations remain critical to the manufacturing sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After expectations for UK growth were revised down by the IMF yesterday, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey data for the manufacturing sector offers some light relief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite dipping from 16 to 10, the orders balance is sitting at its second highest level in three years and the sector appears to be expanding at a healthy pace. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, all aspects of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, particularly manufacturing, will rely heavily on the success of Brexit negotiations. Until we have any clarity on how the UK may fit in, if at all, to the single market, it is difficult to be overly bullish on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer of the EY Item Club is encouraged that the price pressures faced by manufacturers are easing. But Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics is sceptical, pointing out that the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey has been more optimistic than the official data this year. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have just posted their strongest quarter of growth since 1995! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest healthcheck on the sector from the CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses. According to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey, production among UK manufacturers grew at the fastest pace since January 1995 in the three months to July. The survey of 397 manufacturers also found that employee headcount increased at the fastest rate for three years, and firms expect to keep hiring over the next few months. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also optimistic about export prospects over the next year, although new order growth has slowed. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, believes that the slump in the pound since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum is helping UK industry compete overseas. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Output growth among UK manufacturers is the highest we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen since the mid \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc90s, prompting the strongest hiring spree we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the last three years. Cost pressures are easing and firms are upbeat about the outlook for export orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see the benefits from the decline in sterling for UK exporters feeding through. But the flipside is the broader hit to consumer spending power across the economy from stronger inflation, which is likely to have fuelled the slowdown in the economy in Q1 and is expected to pull down growth in Q2.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are the key findings from the report: 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 13% were less optimistic, giving a balance of +5%. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead grew (+13%) at a solid pace 43% of firms said the volume of output over the past three months was up and 12% said it was down, giving a balance of +31%, the highest since January 1995 (+33%) 35% of businesses reported an increase in total orders, and 21% a decrease, giving a balance of +14% Domestic orders (+19%), expanded at a broadly similar pace to the previous quarter, with export orders growth remaining strong, despite slowing (+17%) 32% of manufacturers said employee numbers were up, and 13% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of +18% - the highest since July 2014 (+26%) Average unit costs grew at a more subdued pace (+20%). Growth in average domestic prices (+21%) and average export prices (+24%) was broadly unchanged Stock building of raw materials (+20%) was the strongest since April 1977 (+22%), whilst stocks of work-in-progress rose (+16%) Last night the Greek prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office issued a statement explaining why the government had moved ahead with the sale. It attributed the timing to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a series of positive developments for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and called the market foray an important strategic step in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quest to regain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153viable and stable access\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to international markets. Several factors prompted today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s test run in the markets, including Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to upgrade Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to Caa2 last month, and the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to participate in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout programme, provided adequate debt relief is pledged by EU governments Ending two years of speculation over whether it should join the programme, the Washington-based body approved what was described as a $1.6bn standby loan arrangement, or credit line, for Athens last Thursday. EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has now begun talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports: The visiting commissioner was greeted by a beaming Tsipras at Megaron Maximou, the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residence, where the discussions are now taking place. Senior members of Tsipras leftist Syriza party are describing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mood of jubilation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One insider told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interest in the bond sale is very high, there is a sense of real optimism. If it goes as well as we hope we can start talking of the beginning of the end of darkness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial journalist Owen Sanderson of GlobalCapital has made an important point about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale: This explains why Greece is offering to buy back its old five-year bonds, at a profit. To get that profit, investors need to sign up for the new bonds too: Newsflash! Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale seems to be going well. Reuters is reporting that more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn of bids have been received for Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new five-year debt. And this means Greece may get a better deal! It has changed its guidance, and is now aiming to sell these bonds at a yield of 4.75%, down from 4.875% earlier today. A lower yield means smaller debt repayments, and is a larger vote of confidence from the markets... Shares in posh tonic maker Fever-Tree has surged by 9% to a new record high after hiking its profit forecasts again. Fever-Tree shares are now changing hands at \u00c2\u00a318.94, having floated at 134p in November 2014. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable rise, which turned its co-founders into multi-millionaires. Back in the City of London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 57 points, erasing most of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Mining shares are leading the rally, with BHP Billiton and Antofagasta up 3.2% and Anglo American jumping by 6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to a rise in commodity prices, as the US dollar weakens ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s American interest rate decision. Joshue Mahony of IG explains: As we approach tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion to the July FOMC meeting, there is likely to be an increased degree of hesitancy for traders, with the FX markets in particular seeing recent trends turn to consolidation given the clear event risk ahead. The FTSE is being helped by gains in the commodity sector, with the likes of Anglo American, BHP Billiton, and Antofagasta amongst the firms near the top of the leader board. The dollar weakness story of late is certainly a help for commodity prices, with copper and gold in particular gaining ground this week. Finally, Pierre Moscovici is asked about the collapse in support for the socialist party in France, for which he was a former finance minister. There is a need for social democracy in Europe, he replies, but we need to have ideas that are attractive, credible, reformist and pro-European. There is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no future for the left out of the pro-European scope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he declares. He then tells his audience that it is vital for Brussels to speak with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all parts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Greek political spectrum. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with both prime minister Alexis Tsipras and opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a friend of Greece, with friends in all political parties, Moscovici insists, adding: What matters first and foremost is the future of this great country, inside the eurozone, inside Europe whoever runs it. I think Pierre Moscovici may have been watching the Tour De France. He tells the press conference in Athens that Greece needs to successfully conclude its bailout, to build on its recent success. As he puts it: Confidence in Greece is really coming back, but we need to continue the good work. We need to be on the bicycle, and keep on pedalling. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case for Europe as a whole. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go that way, then the bicycle falls. Moscovici is also asked about debt relief, a long-held demand for Athens. He says that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors must respect the measures agreed at the latest eurogroup meeting (they agreed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrecalibrate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile, extending the maturity of some bonds) European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is giving a press conference in Athens now. Moscovici says Greece is at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turning point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, thanks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several important and very positive developments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since his last visit in February. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signal, he continues, adding that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that Greece will successfully end its bailout programme in 2018. But he also sticks to the Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 script, saying Athens must stick to its reform efforts, and implement the latest austerity measure demanded by its creditors. The press conference is being streamed online, here. Newsflash: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-year bond sale has begun. And we can now see that Athens has priced this debt sale at a yield of 4.875%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below the the interest rate it paid in 2014, allowing prime minister Tsipras to argue that Greece is indeed on the road to normality. Bond yields move inversely to prices, so a higher yield means a bond is seen as riskier. And this price reflects the fact that Greece is still in a bailout, with no certainty that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a fourth rescue deal eventually. In comparison, Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-year bonds are currently trading at a yield of 1.1% while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are trading at just 0.75%. Even so, one City analyst thinks this pricing doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully reflect Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s riskiness: Pierre Moscovici has also met with Greek opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy party are leading the opinion polls. According to this tweet, they discussed how to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcensure the success\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme. After that, Moscovici popped in to see central bank chief Yannis Stournaras for a quick discussion about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. Stournaras was Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister back in 2014, when it held its last bond sale. At the time, Stournaras hailed that sale as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catalytic undertaking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after Athens was swamped with demand from investors. However, many were left with burned fingers after Syriza stormed to power in an election in January 2015.... European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting Athens today to hold talks with top political figures, and discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. He has already met with president Prokopios Pavlopoulos, who reminded Moscovici that Greece is determined to get debt relief. The Athens-Macedonian News Agency has the details: We will meet our commitments and when the time comes the partners will do what they have to do on the debt issue, Greek President Prokopios Pavlopoulos said on Tuesday in a meeting with EU Commissioner for Economic and Finance Affairs Pierre Moscovici who is paying a visit to Athens. On his part, Moscovici said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want Greece to return to normality and stay on course. You can count on us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some financial experts have given Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond sale a thumbs-up. Lutz Roehmeyer of Landesbank Berlin Investment says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect timing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roehmeyer is planning to take part in the deal, and believes that things are looking up for Greece: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is after getting bailout money, after getting the go ahead for a debt reduction next year, after IMF said it is likely to join the bailout finally, after S&amp;P rating action and still before ECB ends QE and started raising rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mohit Kumar, head of interest rates strategy at Credit Agricole, has also backed the sale. Kumar explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Psychologically, yields are below levels when they last came to the market. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to issue because if ECB starts tapering post summer, peripherals would come under pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg has more details. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece is taking a significant step towards exiting its long debt crisis today, as it makes its first return to the financial markets since 2014. Athens is attempting to raise fresh funds by issuing new five-year bonds to international investors. The deal is the Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first attempt to break its reliance on bailout loans since it accepted a third rescue package two years ago. Six (count \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem!) investment banks have been signed up to coordinate the sale, so it should go smoothly. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout runs for another year, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually need to tap the markets. But psychologically, this deal is really important as Athens drives to put the worst of its debt crisis behind it. The key is how much demand Greece finds for its debt, and what price investors are prepared to pay..... As we wrote yesterday, Greece is also offering to buy back the five-year bonds it issued in 2014. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is facing political pressure at home, where his Syriza party is trailing in the polls, so he needs this deal to fly. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said last night that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision is a significant step, part of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy to regain viable and steady access to international markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I suspect Tsipras will also be hoping to sell his bonds at an interest rate below 4.95% - the level which his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, sold his five-year bonds in 2014. Also coming up today Yesterday was a bad one for European traders, with London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shedding 75 points (or 1%). Things should be better today, with the Footsie expected to rise this morning. Technology shares could come under pressure, after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet posted a 28% drop in net profits last night.

European indices ended in the red, even as Wall Street hit new peaks ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting. There is little expectation of any excitement from the Fed, however. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: This afternoon sees investors focus on the latest appearance from Yellen and co, at what promises to be a relatively uneventful meeting by historical standards. With the Fed Funds rate showing a 0% chance of a rate rise, and little chance of a balance sheet reduction being announced today, it is the linguistics which really matter. With no press conference from Yellen to contend with, markets will be keeping a close eye out for any mention within the accompanying statement of a potential September balance sheet reduction, alongside any reference to recent inflation disappointment.

PA explains: Royal Bank of Scotland is likely to avoid the compulsory sale of its Williams &amp; Glyn branches by doling out \u00c2\u00a3835m to help boost competition among UK banks It follows a joint review by the European Commission (EC) and HM Treasury, which have put forward the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternative remedies package\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will help fulfil RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state aid obligations following its Government bailout at the height of the financial crisis. The package includes plans for a \u00c2\u00a3425m fund aimed at competitors across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking and fintech sector, as well as a \u00c2\u00a3350m pot meant to help challenger banks convince small and medium sized business - which were previously Williams &amp; Glyn customers - to switch accounts and loans from RBS. RBS will shell out an another \u00c2\u00a360m to cover additional costs, which will help cover the proposal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implementation. The proposal, which still requires approval by the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College of Commissioners, will save RBS from hiving off the near-300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches, having struggled to find a buyer ahead of its deadline which was set for the end of 2017. A decision by the College of Commissioners that could cement the terms of the proposal is expected in the second half of the year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the jump in the oil price following the US crude stock figures: Oil prices rose to near eight-week highs on Wednesday, with Brent crude futures at over $50 a barrel, as a fall in U.S. inventories bolstered expectations that the long-oversupplied market was moving toward balance... U.S. crude stocks fell last week as refineries hiked output and imports dropped, while gasoline stocks decreased and distillate inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell 7.2 million barrels in the week ending July 21, more than the expected decrease of 2.6 million barrels. The decline was the fourth consecutive drop, giving support to the market. This added to hopes a long-awaited rebalancing was underway in the oil market. Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would limit oil exports to 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, down nearly 1 million bpd from a year earlier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report has strengthened the bullish sentiment already prevailing in the market, although the longevity of the move remains in doubt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Gas Analytics in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude and gasoline stockpiles remain above their five-year averages, which will cap price gains.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drawdown was a combination of higher exports from the United States, marginal decline in oil output and a rise in the refinery utilization rate, he said... But analysts said the current oil price rally could encourage more production, particularly from the United States. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Relieved bulls should be careful what they wish for. Any price rebound will only embolden U.S. shale producers at a time when rumours have started to emerge that the U.S. shale boom is slowing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd PVM oil analyst Stephen Brennock said in a note. Oil prices, already on the rise on signs that recent output cuts could be having an effect, have gained more ground after a bigger than expected weekly fall in US crude stocks. Crude inventories fell by 7.21m last week to 483.42m barrels, much higher than the forecast 2.6m decline, according to the Energy Information Administration. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.02m barrels compared to the expected 0.6m barrel drop. So Brent crude, up around 0.18% at $50.29 a barrel ahead of the US figures, jumped 1.5% to $50.94. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Just as this afternoon looked like it was going to settle into some traditional pre-Fed dreariness the Dow Jones surged to a fresh all-time high off the back of a decent set of earnings. Boeing ended-up being the stock to spark the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lift-off, the jet maker surging more than 8% after beating EPS estimates and raising its full year guidance. This helped the US index rise by 110 or so points after the bell, taking it above 21700 for the first time in its history (for those keeping track, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly 3300 points gained since Trump won the election last November). And that, of course, is not all for the US markets, with July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting still to come. Though the central bank has done a lot to reduce rate hike expectations to effectively zero for this month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the CME FedWatch tool has the chances of a move at just 3.1% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors will be keen to see whether Yellen and co. tee up an autumn or winter increase. US home sales came slightly below forecast last month. June single family home sales rose 0.8% to 0.610m units, compared to expectations of a figure of 0.615m. The May figure was revised down from 0.610m to 0.605m. The median sale price fell 3.4% to $310,800. A raft of positive company results, including Boeing and AT&amp;T, has pushed Wall Street to new record levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new peak of 21,711 shortly after the market opened, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.22% and the S&amp;P 500 0.12% to record levels. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been speaking to Sky about the UK economy: There is a degree of uncertainty aound the UK economy in particular because businesses and consumers are looking for clarity about what our future relationship with the European Union will be. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we attach importance to as early as possible agreeing what the interim arrangements will look like as we leave the European Union in March 2019 and move to a long term different kind of arrangement with the EU. The earlier we can get agreement on transitional arragnements the greater clarity business and consumers will have. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely the first port of call..in removing some of this uncertainty. I think the right way to go forward is to preserve some headroom within our fiscal rules so that if the economy starts to slow we have the ability to respond and support it, but to be very clear that our intention is to get back to living within our means.... to balance the budget by 2025 and make steady progress to doing that. Graham Toy, chief executive officer of the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers, is relatively upbeat about the GDP figures, all things considered, but is worried about rising consumer credit. He says: The economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t firing on all cylinders but neither is it out for the count. In fact, faced with such political uncertainty, the economy is proving to be remarkably resilient. The one concern is that the service sector continues to prop up this growth, fuelled by consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ready access to credit. The upbeat performance of the services sector has helped to offset falls in industrial output and construction. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning shot over spiralling consumer credit could well end up damaging this relatively rosy outlook in the coming months. While the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to rising consumer debt is understandable, the economy - as well as consumer and business confidence - would benefit from a controlled approach to bringing consumer spending under control. Sterling has taken today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth report in its stride. The pound is up 0.3% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1208, and 0.2% higher against the US dollar at $1.305 - broadly unchanged since the GDP data hit the wires. Shares are up too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 32 points to 7466. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too surprising, given the City had expected growth of 0.3% in Q2. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says. The pound didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show any positive reaction in the immediate aftermath of the data release as the number was bang in line with the expectations. Yet equally, the sellers had little desire to show up. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is currently running some way below its potential, according to this chart from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR Director Jagjit Chadha says growth may remain sluggish through 2017. The economy will probably continue to perform at sub-par levels and this importantly this implies only a minor improvement in income per head this year, which is a better measure of welfare than GDP alone. Indeed there are signs that for many households consumption will be crimped as the year progresses with a fall in real disposable income and credit availability drying up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance compares to its rivals. The UK is the second major nation to report second-quarter growth figures after China, which grew by an annual rate of 6.9% [roughly a quarterly rate of 1.7%]. French GDP is being released on Friday morning, and expected to grow by around 0.5%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017 after what government statisticians called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notable slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the first half of the year. The expansion in the three months to June followed 0.2% growth in the first quarter and was in line with City expectations for the eagerly awaited first estimate of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent performance. Official data for gross domestic product showed that of the three big sectors of the economy, only services were bigger at the end of June than in March, posting growth of 0.5% over the quarter. Industrial production, which includes manufacturing, fell by 0.4%, while construction was down by 0.9%. Darren Morgan, head of national accounts at the Office for National Statistics, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year. While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... More here: This chart underlines how the service sector has driven UK growth for years. And this one shows how retail and motion pictures provided the biggest spur to growth..... Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing, it would be growing rather faster without the disruption and uncertainty created by Brexit. So says Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg bank: Since the Lehman recession, the UK has sat comfortably at the top of the G7 growth league. But whereas growth has accelerated significantly so far this year in continental Europe and many emerging markets, the UK is missing out. While the downside risks from the Brexit vote have not yet played out in a major way, the uncertainty stemming from Brexit is leading to caution in all areas of spending and policy that have long-term implications. The UK would probably be growing at 2.5% or above this year were it not for Brexit, with strong gains in real wages and more business investment. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. Experienced City analyst George Magnus warns that Britain is vulnerable if the global economy falters: Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, predicts that the weak growth means the Bank of England will leave interest rates at record lows next month: We expect the Bank to keep policy unchanged until we have greater clarity on what is happening to underlying inflationary pressures in the labour market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Hepworth, investment director at Swiss investment group GAM, says the outlook for the UK is murkier than some people expect: Growth would have been expected to be negatively impacted by the political shocks which came part way through the quarter with the unexpected General Election result and the associated currency weakness affecting the domestic inflation picture. The Office for National Statistics noted that the UK experienced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a notable slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the first half of the year, reflective of the continuing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. This follows on from the IMF earlier this week cutting its 2017 growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% from 2%. The outlook isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as rosy as some suggest and affirms our cautious view on UK assets, particularly domestic equities and sterling. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained sluggish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the last three months. Worryingly, she expects this to continue for a while....and is urging the government to negotiate a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal to help companies after the UK leaves the EU. Newton-Smith says: We expect growth to remain lukewarm over the next couple of years, so providing businesses with certainty and stability has never been more important. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A limited transition period as we leave the EU where the UK stays in the single market and a customs union until a final deal is in force, would help create a bridge to a new trading arrangement. It would give businesses the confidence they need to invest, expand and create jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This table shows how the UK service sector drove growth in the last quarter, while industrial production and construction shrank: On a per-capita basis, UK GDP rose by only 0.1% in the last quarter. In other words, if you adjust for population changes, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy barely grew at all. Political reaction to the GDP figures is coming in now. Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, points out that the economy is still growing.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our economy has grown continuously for four and a half years, delivering record levels of employment. We can be proud of that; but we are not complacent. We need to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards for people across the country. That is why we are committed to investing in infrastructure, technology and skills to deliver the best possible base for strong future growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, is alarmed that UK growth since January is the weakest since 2012. McDonnell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The truth is that the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 austerity cuts have undermined working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards and weakened the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only a Labour Government has a strategic plan of investment to boost growth, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule; which will help build a high wage, high skill economy that works for the many not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says the overall picture of the UK economy this year is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grim\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd compared to 2016. And that means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little room for the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates. Berich says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite frothy optimism in sector survey data, manufacturing failed to make a positive contribution to GDP growth, but if the latest surveys are to be believed this may change in the second half of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main takeaways from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures are that the UK economy continues to live and die by the consumer, and the business investment pickup hoped for by the Bank of England has not yet materialised. The BoE has been making some hawkish noises lately, but data like these mean the MPC would need to be very confident indeed about investment picking up in the immediate future to hike rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s film industry has played a significant role in the modest growth in GDP in the last three months. An ONS spokesman said boost to film production was the biggest factor, though he was unable to give details of specific films that had contributed to the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output in recent months. Underlying the continued attraction of the big screen, he said the success of cinema ticket sales for Wonder Woman and the latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise also played a part. Recent tax credit changes have also made the UK a more attractive prospect for production companies. As this chart shows, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motion picture and publishing sector has significantly outpaced the European Union average since 2014: On the upside, this is the 18th quarter of growth in a row. But on the downside, Britain has now recorded its weakest six months of growth since 2012. Growth is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly becoming harder to come by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. Curtin adds: The competitive pound has boosted exports, as has increasing global demand. However, weakening consumer spending power is a real concern. The lack of real-terms wage inflation also continues to drag, as does low productivity. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, companies still do not have clarity on the nature of Brexit, which is impeding long-term investment decisions. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scant evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has rebalanced during the last three months. While the service sector grew by 0.5%, manufacturing output actually contracted by 0.5% during the quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly due to a fall in production of motor vehicles. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now 9% above its pre-downturn peak, says the ONS. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has experienced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 a notable slowdown in the first half of this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says ONS Head of National Accounts Darren Morgan said: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because GDP only grew by 0.2% in January-to-March, and then by 0.3% in April-to-June - both below the long-term growth trend. Morgan explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that the UK economy has expanded by 1.7% over the last 12 months, down from 2% three months ago. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector drove the economy in the last quarter, with output rising by 0.5%. But, as feared, industrial output shrank by 0.4% and construction contracted by 0.9%. BREAKING: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.2% in the first quarter, and in line with City forecasts. More to follow... The tension is building.... The pound is creeping higher as City traders get ready for the growth figures in 20 minutes time. Sterling has gained 0.3% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little higher against the US dollar, at $1.303. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect the pound to rally if GDP is stronger than expected, and slide if the data is disappointing. Andy Bruce of Reuters confirms that most economists expect a modest increase in UK growth: If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, that will show that Britain has suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a clear loss of momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year, say Marc Ostwald of ASM Investor Services. He adds: Overall the UK economy looks it is moving to the bottom of the G7 growth league table, though it should be added that it is currently not headed for recession. If you really want know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in an economy, GDP is a rather blunt tool. It tries to measure the total value of all of the goods made, and services provided, in an economy, to show whether it grew or shrank. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t track unpaid work, show whether growth came at the cost of environmental damage, who benefitted from this economic activity, or whether it made economic inequality better or worse. Nearly fifty years ago, US senator Robert Kennedy eloquently summed up the problems with GDP. In a speech at the University of Kansas, Kennedy explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and its counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rifle and Speck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Many City economist have warned that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK growth figures may show little improvement on the first quarter of this year. Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kristoffer Kj\u00c3\u00a6r Lomholt says: We estimate the economy expanded by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, which is not much stronger than the 0.2% q/q growth rate in Q1 (the weakest among the EU member states). The main reason is that private consumption has slowed, as the weaker pound is eroding consumer purchasing power. Royal Bank of Canada have cut their growth forecast from 0.4% to 0.3%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: After considering the pattern of activity in construction and industrial production in April and May, and the headwinds for the consumer that have been constraining elements of service sector growth, we now consider that it would take an unlikely combination of positive news across all sectors in June to get to growth of 0.4% q/q overall. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to EY Item Club, also expects growth of around 0.3%: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks odds-on that whatever growth the UK managed to eke out in the second quarter will have been solely due to the services sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This does appear to have seen some pick-up in activity after a particularly weak first-quarter performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial production and, especially, construction output both fell month-on-month in April and May, and were clearly on course for contraction over the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite decent overall manufacturing surveys for June, we suspect industrial production could have contracted by around 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter while construction output may have fallen by around 1.7% quarter-on-quarter. Good morning! We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to discover how well, or badly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in the last three months. New GDP data, due at 9.30am, will give the first official insight into UK growth in the second quarter of 2017. It will show whether the economy bounced back from its slowdown at the start of the year, or is still stuck in a soft patch. And the figures may reinforce fears that the economy has lost momentum this year. The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top number crunchers predict that the economy expanded by between 0.2% and 0.4% in April-to-June, with a consensus of +0.3% growth. Industrial production and construction are expected to have struggled. That would be little better than in Q1, when GDP rose by just 0.2%. That made Britain the slowest-growing G7 economy, as consumer-facing industries shrank and household spending was hit by rising prices. Many economists fear that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fundamentals are deteriorating, as Brexit uncertainty hits business investment and the weak pound pushing up inflation. But more optimistically, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has already racked up 17 quarters of growth in a row. That should become 18 quarters today (unless something very nasty happened....) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you the GDP data at 9.30am, followed by instant reaction and analysis through the day, plus any other major economic and financial events. The agenda: 9.30am BST: First estimate of UK growth in Q2 2017 3pm BST: US new home sales figures 7pm BST: US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on American interest rates and stimulus programme",

                "bodyText":"With this, we are closing the blog for today. Good-bye and thank you for all your great comments. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has got off to flying start: US stocks have risen to fresh record highs boosted by a flurry of strong company results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 70 points, or 0.4%, to 21778.96 while the S&amp;P 500 advanced nearly 4 points, or 0.15%, to 2481.73. and the Nasdaq climbed 33 points, or 0.5%, to 6455.67. Here in London, the FTSE 100 index is still in negative territory, down nearly 13 points at 7439.65, a 0.2% drop. Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after US durable goods data showed a better than expected 6.5% gain in orders in June, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at online broker UFX.com. A downbeat assessment on current inflation levels at yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed Reserve meeting had cast further uncertainty over the next interest rate, although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers suggest the US economy remains in good health.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The greenback could claw back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses against major European counterparts. Attention now turns to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-important GDP data. The US economy must continue to meet expectations if Janet Yellen is to confirm an interest rate hike in September. Phillip Hammond has found a new Bank of England deputy governor to replace the disgraced Charlotte Hogg from within his own Treasury ranks. The chancellor has appointed the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic adviser, Sir David Ramsden to replace Hogg, who resigned earlier this year after failing to disclose that her brother was a senior executive at Barclays \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bank she would have regulated. Ramsden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full title will be deputy governor of markets and banking. Hogg was also chief operating officer, but that post is going to someone else. The Bank of England will make a separate announcement about that post later today. Ramsden has a long list of responsibilities in his new role, the Treasury said, including : specific responsibility for managing the balance sheet, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange reserves, and the gathering of market intelligence relevant to policy decisions. Sir Dave, as he is known, will also be a member of the monetary policy committee, the financial policy committee, the prudential regulation committee and the court of the Bank of England. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil consumption could peak as early as the late 2020s as electric cars become more popular, says Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden. But he added that oil would still be needed for several more decades, arguing that it will remain the main fuel used in planes, ships and heavy trucks. He told reporters after Shell, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest oil company reported a sharp rise in quarterly profits: Even if the UK, France and the western world in general will all go to 100% electric vehicles, that would be great, but that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough... We still have less advanced economies that cannot do that switch. He even admitted that he would get an electric car the next time he buys a new vehicle, in an interview with Bloomberg. The International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog, does not expect oil demand to peak before 2040. Shell, which has been producing oil since 1907, and its rivals are increasingly switching to less-polluting natural gas. France has decided to nationalise the STX France shipyard, marking president Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first major industrial policy decision, Reuters is reporting, citing Le Monde. The French government has been in an ownership standoff with Italy over the shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, north-western France. Reuters says: As France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most pro-business leader in decades, few would have predicted the former investment banker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first big move in the corporate sector to be a nationalisation. However, his action fits with the interventionist style of other postwar French leaders. It also crosses into the strategically sensitive defence sector where many national governments prefer to wield influence over ownership. The Economy Ministry would not comment on the report when asked by Reuters, but said it would hold a news conference on the subject at 3:00 pm (1300 GMT). Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had given the Italians until Thursday to accept an offer for 50/50 ownership of the shipyard, brandishing the threat of a temporary nationalisation to buy time to find another solution if the offer were rebuffed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The aim is not to nationalise Saint-Nazaire, but we have to temporarily.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The warm summer weather added a sizzle to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets this month: retail sales growth hit a three-month high as shoppers updated their summer wardrobes and bought more groceries, according to a monthly survey from the CBI employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 group. Its retail sales balance rose to 22 in July from 12 in June, marking the highest reading since April. Expectations for next month were the strongest since last December, but the CBI warned it might not last. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: While retailers expect a similar pace of growth next month, the factors underpinning their sales growth are more shaky. Although employment is strong, real incomes are falling in the wake of higher inflation, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to feed slower consumer spending growth ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick market round-up. The FTSE 100 index has slipped into negative territory, trading down some 2 points at 7450.24. AstraZeneca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are weighing on the index, as is the stronger pound, which is rising against the dollar after a more cautious statement from the US Federal Reserve last night suggested the next interest rate hike may be some way off, and sent the greenback sliding. Sterling has risen as high as $1.3157, its highest level since mid-September \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good news for holidaymakers heading to the US. It has eased back to $1.3141, but is still about 1% higher than before the Fed statement. However, the euro has also rallied against the dollar and sterling is still close to eight-week lows on expectations that the European Central Bank will tighten policy later this year. It is trading at 89.21 pence per euro. AstraZeneca is the biggest faller with a 16.1% loss to \u00c2\u00a342.87 after news of a key lung cancer drug trial failure, and the stock is on track for its worst day ever. Lloyds Banking Group is also among the biggest losers after reporting another \u00c2\u00a31bn charge for PPI claims. Its shares are down 2.3% at 67.49p. Drinks giant Diageo is the biggest riser, with the shares up 6.5% at \u00c2\u00a324.20. The maker of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff raised its profitability target and unveiled a share buyback programme. Sky has also reported results this morning. Our media correspondent Mark Sweney reports: Sky is to hire 300 new technology staff to keep pace with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon as the broadcaster suffered a drop in full year profits and an increase in the rate of customers defecting to rivals. Here is our full story on Lloyds. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is fielding numerous questions about whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaving to join Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Teva. With a sigh, he said The head of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets watchdog just said that the UK will scrap the scandal-hit Libor interest rate benchmark from the end of 2021, when a substitute index should be in place. Libor is based on banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 submissions of interest rates they believe they would be charged for borrowing money. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech in London that work must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153begin in earnest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on shifting to an alternative index, saying that aiming for the end of 2021 would ensure a smooth transition. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is speaking on a conference call to journalists after the failure of a key lung cancer drug trial sent the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down more than 15%, to \u00c2\u00a343.24. The stock is heading for its worst day ever. Soriot, whilst saying that the company never comments on market speculation and rumours, has tried to squash the speculation triggered by a recent media report that he could jump ship and defect to Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Teva, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest generics drugmaker. He said: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m impressed with the progress we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m proud to be the CEO of this company and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking forward to continuing on our journey ahead... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m committed to delivering our strategy of returning to growth. Travel company Thomas Cook as announced that it will start selling holidays in Tunisia again soon, after the UK changed its travel advice yesterday. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser told journalists: The foreign office came to the conclusion that it is again safe to travel. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any programme for the winter so we are setting up a really good quality offer for Tunisia and this is going to take some time. I suppose that we are gong to start during the winter season, but more towards the spring.

Pretax profits dropped to \u00c2\u00a33.8m in the six months to June, from \u00c2\u00a310.5m a year earlier. Chief executive Nic Budden said: Our performance has been resilient in the context of a London property market that has been further impacted by unprecedented economic and political uncertainty.

Shares in AstraZeneca have crashed more than 16%, after the drugmaker suffered a major setback with the failure of an key lung cancer trial. The shares plunged as low as \u00c2\u00a342.71, wiping about \u00c2\u00a310bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value. The long-awaited initial results from the Mystic study found that a combination of two injectable immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, failed to help patients. Chief medical officer Sean Bohen described the results as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but said the trial would continue to assess overall survival. The news came as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest pharmaceuticals firm reported an 8% fall in revenues in the second quarter to $5.05bn at constant currencies, while core earnings per share rose 6% to 87 cents. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a look at the company results. Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds has set aside another \u00c2\u00a3700m to meet PPI claims, taking the PPI charge in its first half to \u00c2\u00a31bn.

Lloyds is reporting its first results since the government sold the last chunk of its shareholding in the lender in May, after rescuing during the financial crisis with a \u00c2\u00a320.3bn bailout. Its chief executive Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Horta Os\u00c3\u00b3rio has just told journalists on a call: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no intention of going anywhere,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trying to squash speculation that he could be on the way out. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has hit $1.3146, its highest level since last September against the dollar, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Federal Reserve statement. The dollar is sliding after the Fed adopted a more cautious tone on the inflation outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u201c boosting expectations that the next interest rate hike may be delayed until next year. The Fed kept rates unchanged last night and said it expected to start paring back its huge bond holdings \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cementing expectations this will start in September. But while it expects the economy to keep strengthening, it noted that inflation had declined. The Fed statement sent the dollar to 13-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The euro hit $1.1777, its highest level since early 2015. There is a raft of company results today, while the economic agenda is light. In Germany, consumer confidence reached a 16-year high, according to the GfK market research group. Its indicator rose to 10.8 going into August from 10.6 in July.

                "bodyText":"After a flurry of growth reports today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming clear that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has underperformed its rivals in the last quarter. Two days ago, we learned that the UK expanded by merely 0.3% in April-June, following a modest expansion of 0.2% in January-March. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data has shown that other advanced countries did rather better. Namely: France: Grew by 0.5% in Q1 and Q2 US: Grew by over 0.6% in Q2, and 0.3% in Q1 Spain: Grew by 0.9% in Q2, and 0.8% in Q1 Sweden: Grew by a rollicking 1.7% in Q2, and 0.6% in Q1 Ireland is likely to post impressive GDP figures, following the growth upgrades from its central bank today (details here). Canada is also enjoying a good quarter, judging by the surge in growth during June (details here). Many of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP reports showed that trade made a positive contribution to growth in the last quarter; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good sign for the global economy. Britain, though, is being held back by rising inflation and concerns over Brexit. Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says Britain is lagging behind other leading economies. While growth in Q2 has recovered somewhat from its anaemic performance in the first three months of the year, there is still a high level of political and economic uncertainty. Based on our data and analysis, we are maintaining our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk outlook for the UK until there is more clarity on how Brexit and the fallout from the general election will impact businesses operating in the UK market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our advice to businesses is to continue to monitor economic indicators and how Brexit negotiations develop over the coming months. Furthermore, we are maintaining our baseline scenario of a gradually slowing economy over the next two years. Leaving the EU will undoubtedly pose challenges, especially for companies whose supply chains involve sourcing from or selling to the continent. Although the weak pound is currently providing support for some sectors, such as manufacturing and tourism, it is far from certain that this stimulus will be enough to counterbalance the adverse Brexit effects over the medium to long term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political editor, Faisal Islam, reckons this slowdown is forcing the UK government to adjust its Brexit strategy: And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to stop for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting, and I hope you have a great weekend. GW European stock markets have closed in the red tonight. The FTSE 100 shed 74 points, or 1%, partly due to the slump in tobacco shares. The French and German markets also suffered losses, amid worries that the strong euro will hurt profits. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Investors in the UK market have a high threshold for being impressed by company earnings, but they are quick to punish you if the result doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t measure up. It is almost like dealers are looking for excuses not to go long the FTSE 100. Stock markets in Continental Europe have been losing ground since between May and June, and indices like the DAX and CAC 40 can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to shake off the bearish sentiment surrounding them. The strength of the euro is hindering eurozone equity benchmarks, and the market chatter that the European Central Bank will rein in their very aggressive bond buying scheme is also adding to their problems. Wall Street is also down, hit by the healthcare vote debacle - and not helped by reports that North Korea has fired a missile which landed in Japanese waters. Looking back at GDP, Canada has blown past expectations by reporting 0.6% growth in May alone. That suggests its growth during the second quarter will be strong. Back in the markets, shares into tobacco companies are tumbling after US authorities announced a new clampdown on the industry. The Food and Drug Administration is planning to curb the number of deaths caused by tobacco. One of the ideas is to cut the amount of nicotine in combustible cigarettes to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-addictive levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to save millions of lives, says FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City investors reacted swiftly to the plan, driving British American Tobacco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down by over 10% (it makes Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans). Other major tobacco firms, including Imperial Brands and Philip Morris, are also sliding -- a sign that the FDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan could have a profound effect on their businesses. Back in Greece, Hollywood A-listers are giving the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tourist sector a boost. A steady stream of celebrities are cropping up among the record 30 million choosing the country for holidays this summer. After Australian star Hugh Jakeman spending time on the Cycladic isle of Antiparos (where Tom Hanks regularly summers and has a home), Angelina Jolie and Keanu Reeves have followed suite holidaying this week on the Ionian island of Paxos. Jolie had promised to return to Greece when in her role as ambassador of the UN refugee agency she met prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens last year. The record number of tourists are expected to help the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects following its return to markets on Monday. But .....with visitor numbers growing the economic crime police have also been swooping on islands in a bid to crack down on tax evasion by stores and restaurants. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent public revenues body has announced it will undertake an urgent audit of a sample 2.500 hotels country-wide amid widespread speculation that, at the height of the tourist season, they are not declaring all overnight stays. Auditors have been ordered to cross-check declared income with tax remittances filed to the state. Restaurants are also thought to be in the firing line as the leftist-led government seeks to crack down on big time tax evaders. Well-known eateries on popular isles such as Mykonos and Paros are said to earn as much as one million euros a month which they fail to declare. At least some of the revenue, from catering for weddings and other socialite events, is never seen in Greece as it is deposited straight into UK bank accounts.... Oxford Economic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gregory Daco has tweeted some useful charts, showing how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate picked up in the last quarter.... ...and how consumer spending and exports helped drive the recovery. Associated Press have a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US growth report. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The U.S. economy revved up this spring after a weak start to the year, fuelled by a surge in consumer spending. But the growth spurt still fell short of the optimistic goals President Donald Trump hopes to achieve through tax cuts and regulatory relief. The Commerce Department said Friday that growth in the gross domestic product, the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total output of goods and services, expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than double the revised 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter. The improvement was powered in large part by robust consumer appetite for items such as clothing and furniture. The 2.6% GDP gain came in close to economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers continue to drive the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, but firmer business investment is also a plus,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weaker housing construction was the only significant drag on growth in the quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump campaigned on a pledge to boost growth to rates of 4% or better. So far, his economic program has not advanced in Congress. More here: Another detail from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report: Despite accelerating in the last quarter, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) achieving the growth rates targeted by Donald Trump. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy has improved following a slow start to the year, in spite of a lack of fiscal stimulus so far from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. A strong performance in export and industrial sectors has been buoyed by weaker dollar, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a steady increase in earnings too. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still some way from the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3%+ growth target, but the good news is this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t priced in by the market, so any additional tax relief or infrastructure spending could support markets into year end. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite improving growth, wage inflation remains somewhat elusive, but the labour market remains reasonably strong, and we anticipate the Fed will proceed as planned with its slow and steady programme of interest rate normalisation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Ross of the Renmin University of China shows how growth is close to its long-term average: Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is benefitting from consumer spending and business investment: The 2.6% annualised gain in real GDP in the second quarter was driven by a rebound in real consumption growth, and suggests that GDP is still on track for growth of around 2.2% for 2017 as a whole. This should convince the Fed that, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, the real economy remains in good shape. Real consumption increased by 2.8% annualised, up from 1.9% in the first quarter. Furthermore, business investment posted a healthy 5.2% annualised gain, although residential investment declined by nearly 7%. The weakness in the latter is unlikely to last. Meanwhile, after subtracting a massive 1.5% points from growth in the first quarter, inventories were a negligible drag in the second. The annual revisions didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change much, with growth in the previous two quarters revised down slightly, and growth for 2016 as a whole nudged down to 1.5%, from 1.6%. Heather Long of the Washington Post says the acceleration in US growth in the last quarter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exceptional. She points out that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy usually accelerates in April-June.... Jason Furman, one of President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy advisors, says the economy has grown at its trend level this year. Patrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management is encouraged the businesses kept investing. US companies helped the American economy grow in the last quarter, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report. Business spending on equipment rose by 8.2% in the last three months, the fastest since the third quarter of 2015. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts more than doubled, while investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 4.9% pace. Trade added 0.18 percentage point to growth, but investment on homebuilding shrank by 6.8%. Breaking: The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.6% in the second quarter of 2017, more than twice as fast as in Q1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of 0.65% quarter-on-quarter growth; double Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% growth rate,and quicker than France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% growth too. American GDP was driven by consumer spending, which grew by 2.8%. Net trade also contributed to growth, with exports up 4.1% and imports up only 2.1%. This is a significant acceleration compared to the first quarter, where growth has been revised down to 1.2% annualised growth (or 0.3% quarter-on-quarter). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very slightly below the consensus forecast, of 2.7% annualise growth. More to follow.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the biggest event of the day - the first estimate of US GDP in the second quarter of the year. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest minds agree that the growth rate probably rebounded after slowing in Q1, although they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree by how much.... These figures are all annualised, so divide by four to get the true quarterly growth rate.... The figures land at 1.30pm BST, or 8.30am in Washington.... The Economist Intelligence Unit have hailed Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye-catchingly fast growth: Economic issues are also on the agenda in Greece today, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been hailing its return to growth earlier this year. Helena Smith our correspondent in Athens, reports: Addressing the second in a series of regional growth conferences in the central town of Lamia, the leftist leader declared that economic recovery was now the equivalent of thrice-bailed out Greece regaining its national sovereignty. He told an audience of local business leaders, politicians and regional officials that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The goal of growth is connected to the very existence of our nation, our national sovereignty, the prosperity of our people, our children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras said that Greece is finally heading out of seven long dark years, after returning to the financial markets on Monday with its first bond sale since 2014. The government hopes to repeat that test run soon, as it prepared to exit its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout programme in August 2018. The prime minister had made a similar pledge in an exclusive interview with the Guardian on Monday in which he described Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regaining of economic sovereignty as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153priority.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason why stock markets are edgy today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Amazon. The e-commerce giant missed earnings forecasts last night, sending its shares down 3% in after-hours trading. Although Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales beat expectations, profits were lower than expected as the company spent more on infrastructure like warehouses and data centres. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth, and its habit of expanding into ever-new areas, comes at a price.... This meant that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lost the crown of being the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man, just a few hours after wrestling it from Bill Gates. I suspect his time will come again... Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has hiked its growth forecasts for this year, but warned that Brexit is a significant threat. The Central Bank of Ireland now expects GDP to surge by 4.5% this year, up from the 3.5% it expected back in April. It also raised its 2018 growth forecasts to 3.6%, from 3.2%. Central Bank Chief Economist Gabriel Fagan explained that Ireland is benefitting from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Revised projections for growth this year and in 2018 reflect both stronger momentum in the domestic economy and improved prospects for external demand, especially from our European trading partners,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a small and open economy, Ireland continues to face economic risks externally. And despite there being little new information emerging to date, it is clear that the economic impact of Brexit on Ireland is set to be negative and material. At home, we must continue to prudently monitor the risk of overheating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full economic impact depends on exactly what form of Brexit Britain ends up with. If it exits the customs union and the single market, then robust border controls would probably be reinstalled between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, there are reports today that Dublin is pushing for border controls to be shifted to the coastline. That idea has already been attacked by Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unionist politicians - including the DUP, who are propping up the UK government in Westminster... European stock markets have responded to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid growth reports by, er, falling to their lowest level in three months. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is the worst performer, down 1.4%, with Germany and the UK not too far behind. This is partly due to the strength of the euro, which has rallied to a 2.5 year high this week. Traders are also nervous after watching the US Senate shoot down Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Obamacare. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Market explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equities are in the red mid-morning, sentiment dented by fresh dollar weakness as even a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcskinny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US healthcare repeal bill fails in the Senate, delivering more unwelcome pound and euro strength. Breaking! Economic confidence across the eurozone has inched up to its highest level in a decade. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest in a stream of upbeat data, which underline how Europe is putting its debt crisis behind it. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment index, just released, has hit 111.2 for July, up from 111.1 in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since the financial crisis began a decade ago. Construction firms and service sector companies reported the biggest improvement in sentiment, while consumer confidence dipped. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the UK wrestles with its lowest levels of consumer confidence since the Brexit vote, things are far rosier on the continent. The latest reading suggests that spending is at healthy levels in the eurozone despite the heightened political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the first quarter of the year proving to be a challenge for the eurozone following UK and French general elections, spirits haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been dampened in the aftermath and consumers refuse to be unfazed by tricky economic conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With steady employment figures continuing to have a positive bearing on consumer confidence and showing no signs of letting up, Michel Barnier will feel he holds the chips while looking across the table at David Davis, as Brexit talks rumble on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone growth figures have helped to push the euro a little higher against the US dollar. The euro is back over $1.17 this morning, a gain of 0.2%. The dollar, though, is also suffering from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest failure to dismantle Obamacare. After a dramatic late-night vote, the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skinny repeal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bill was rejected by the Senate, by 51 votes to 49. Crucially, veteran lawmaker John McCain was one of three Republicans to vote against the measure, which would have left millions more Americans without healthcare cover. This makes it even less likely that Trump can achieve a major infrastructure spending programme, or tax reforms (cuts). Kit Juckes of Societe General explains: The man of the moment this morning is John McCain who voted no and so the Senate failed to repeal Obamacare by a single vote. Another hurdle for President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare reform, another hurdle backing the funds for tax reform, another hurdle in the way of higher Treasury yields and a so nothing good for the dollar in that announcement. Update: Although McCain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote was both dramatic and decisive, Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have led the battle against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare plans. More here: Silvia Walter of Swiss Life Asset Managers is impressed by Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery: Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Torbj\u00c3\u00b6rn Isaksson of Nordea Markets. He reckons the Swedish economy continues to perform very well, mainly due to strong domestic demand. Isaksson adds: GDP rose by a full 1.7% q/q and as much as 4.0% y/y. Our call was 1.1% q/q while the Riksbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast was 0.7% q/q. Moreover, the first quarter was revised upwards by 0.2% points to 0.6% q/q. The main surprises are fixed investments and inventories. Residential construction continues to be a very important growth driver (scary!), but also other investments seem to have picked up and more than forecast. Inventories weighed on growth but much less than we had in mind. Wowzers! Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by a blistering 1.7% in the last quarter. That smashes analyst forecasts of 1% growth, and means Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has expanded by an impressive 4% over the last year. Sweden appears to be benefitting from its current loose monetary policy - interest rates are negative, to encourage banks to lend..... Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.8% in the last quarter, thanks to a boost in trade. New figures show that exports jumped by 2.4% in April to June, up from 2.0% in January to March. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has finally reached its pre-crisis peak, thanks to the 0.9% growth recorded in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important moment, but it has come at a cost. As El Pais points out, Spain still employs 1.9 million fewer people than in 2008. Newsflash: Spain has recorded another strong quarter of growth, beating both the UK and France. Spanish GDP rose by 0.9% in the last three months, new figures from statistics body INE show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three times as fast Britain managed during the quarter, and nearly double France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.8% in the first quarter of 2017, and means Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row (or nearly four years). On an annual basis, Spanish GDP grew by 3.1%. More to follow.... Ouch. Shares in BT have fallen by 1.7% at the start of trading after posting a 40% drop in profits. My colleague Mark Sweney explains why.... BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits slumped more than 40% in the first quarter of its new financial year after it was forced to pay out \u00c2\u00a3225m to two shareholders following the accounting scandal at its Italian operation. Deutsche Telekom and Orange became shareholders in BT after the company struck a \u00c2\u00a312.5bn cash and shares deal to buy mobile company EE in 2015. As part of that deal the two companies were issued a warranty as a protection against a slump in BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. DT and Orange triggered a claim under the warranty after BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value plunged by almost \u00c2\u00a38bn, after the company revealed the extent of a \u00c2\u00a3530m accounting scandal at its Italian operation. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price remains more than 20% lower that it was a year ago. The news that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by a healthy 0.5% last quarter should reassure investors, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Over in Europe, the French GDP data brought more light for the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The problem child of the Eurozone is no longer a problem child, in fact, it has grown up and living up to the expectations. Bloomberg journalist Mark Deen reckons the French economy has entered a purple patch: Over in the City, Barclays has told shareholders its setting aside another \u00c2\u00a3700m to cover the cost of the PPI scandal (in which customers were sold insurance they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need, or ask for). Barclays has also posted a net loss of \u00c2\u00a31.2bn for the last six months, having losing \u00c2\u00a32.2bn through the sale of its Africa business. More on that shortly.... Diego Iscaro, senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight, thinks France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in decent shape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP rose by 0.5% q/q during the second quarter of 2017, according to seasonally-adjusted figures released by the INSEE. The economy had grown by the same magnitude during the first three months of the year. Net foreign trade was the main driver of growth during the second quarter, adding 0.8 percentage point to the total change in demand, as exports rebounded strongly. Domestic demand, excluding stocks, also made a positive contribution. Internal demand was boosted by a new increase in investment spending (although it decelerated compared to the first quarter) and a modest acceleration in private consumption. The figures show France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy posting solid growth during the second quarter and support our view that GDP is likely to grow by around 1.6% in 2017. This would be the strongest performance in six years. We expect growth to remain healthy during the second half of the year, boosted by gradually improving labour market situation, muted inflation and solid external demand. Confidence indices suggest that firms and households are also more upbeat about the economic outlook, which should also help to support domestic demand. Investment spending should also be supported by favourable credit conditions and improving demand levels during the second half of 2017. The French economic recovery seems to be well stablished, but there are still risks on the horizon. Although hopes for the implementation of reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly on the fiscal and labour market fronts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are high, the risk of the government not delivering as expected is not negligible, despite its large majority in the National Assembly. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures should cheer France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new leader, says Mehreen Khan of the FT. She writes: The official figures will be a boon for president Macron who has vowed to overhaul the French economy after years of lagging behind its major eurozone rival, Germany. Unemployment in France is now at its lowest since the eurozone crisis, inflation has been tamed, and business surveys are revealing the best confidence levels in a decade. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics agrees that France did well in the last quarter.... Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fergal O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien flags up that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now grown for a year. This chart shows how net trade boosted French growth in the last quarter. Breaking: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2017. That matches economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts, and outpaces Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% growth in the last three months. It means that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now grown steadily for the last year, and by 0.5% per quarter for the last nine months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty solid performance. The French economy was helped by a surge in exports - they rose by 3.1% in April to June, while imports only rose by 0.2%. Consumer spending rose too, to 0.3% from 0.1% in Q1. However, business investment slowed to 0.5% from 2.1% in January to March. On an annual basis, French GDP grew by 1.8% - again, slightly faster than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.7% year-on-year growth. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get two key pieces of economic data this morning - new growth figures from France and America. Together, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll help us to see how the global economy performed in the second quarter of this year. Economists expect that both countries grew fairly solidly, with French GDP tipped to rise by 0.5% and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by around 0.7% (or 2.7% on an annualised basis). We also find out how Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in May. Update: Spanish growth figures are also coming this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also another busy morning for financial news. Barclays bank, telecoms group BT, airline operator IAG and online estate agent Rightmove are among those reporting results. The agenda: 6.30am BST: French GDP for the second quarter of 2017 8am BST: Spanish GDP for the second quarter of 2017 10am BST: Eurozone consumer confidence 1pm BST: German inflation for July 1.30pm BST: US GDP for the second quarter of 2017 1.30pm BST: Canadian GDP for May",

                "bodyText":"On a relatively quiet day for company and economic news, the weakness of the dollar was a dominant theme once more. The latest going-on in the White House - including the change of chief of staff following the healthcare bill failure - have helped undermine the US currency, with investors questioning how much of his promised tax reforms and spending plans will actually see the light of day. Added to that was the nervousness surrounding the latest missile tests by North Korea. So with the euro and pound benefitting from the greenback\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness, European markets mainly ended the day lower. But the recent run of positive US company results, and hopes for the same from Apple on Tuesday, helped pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to new peaks. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 3.63 points or 0.05% to 7372.00 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.37% to 12,118.25 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.73% lower at 5093.77 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 0.26% ahead at 21,486.91 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.32% at 10,502.2 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.95% to 812.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 84 points or 0.39%, close to its intraday peak. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More on the strike at the Bank of England, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response: The Bank has been informed that industrial action called by Unite will commence at midnight tonight for three days. The Union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce. The Bank has plans in place so that all essential business will continue to operate as normal during this period. The Bank has been in talks with Unite up to and including today and remains ready to continue those talks at any time. The weak dollar has also seen the euro gain ground against the US currency: Sterling has hit a new 10 month high against the dollar, as the US currency continues to struggle with the uncertainties caused by the actions and comments from the president. The pound is currently up 0.35% at $1.3178, having earlier hit $1.32 for the first time since 16 September. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling jumped to fresh 10-month highs as the end of month 4pm fix sent cable higher. The pound exploded higher to $1.31999, having the briefest of flirts with the $1.32 handle before easing back. The move came as the dollar heads for its worst month since January. Cable is now trading at its highest since mid-September 2016 on this sustained bout of dollar weakness. Clearly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all to do with Donald Trump saying it was too strong and the market having confidence in him\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6more likely it is the exact opposite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c concerns about the chaos in Washington and a complete lack of faith in the administration delivering any kind of meaningful economic or fiscal reforms. There is also growing doubt that the US Federal Reserve will be in a position to raise interest rates again in the immediate future. After its earlier gains on Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, the oil price is now on the slide. Opec crude output rose by 90,000 barrels a day this month to a high for the year, according to Reuters, as supplies from Libya continued to recover. So, ahead of a meeting next week between Opec and non-Opec producers, Brent crude is now down 0.4% at $52.28 a barrel, having earlier reached a peak for the day of $52.92. Back with the UK consumer credit figures, and TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has called for the government to take action: Wages are still lower than before financial crisis, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wonder that families are being forced deeper and deeper into debt. If working people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see extra cash in their pocket, borrowing will continue to spiral. Setting aside mortgages, household debt is likely to hit an all-time high this year. The government needs to boost investment to get wages rising again. They should start by ending public sector pay restrictions and putting the minimum wage up to \u00c2\u00a310 as soon as possible. Meanwhile Elliott Silk, Head of Commercial at Sanlam UK, said: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions to curtail the growth of unsecured loans has had some impact, but more action is needed. While consumer credit accounts for a fraction of household debt, people are much more likely to default on unsecured loans. A lot of this has to do with understanding the area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is a lack of financial education on the national curriculum, which means young people often come out of education na\u00c3\u00afve to the negative consequences of unsecured loans and personal debt. Companies also have a large part to play in the financial wellbeing of their employees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise, they too will feel the negative impact that financial stress can have on employee performance. The Press Association is reporting some bad news for Bank of England governor Mark Carney ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting: US markets continue to be buoyant, despite a relatively quiet day in terms of economic and corporate news. But there is a lot coming up this week for investors to get their teeth into, which could well provide some volatility. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that much to drive the index higher this Monday, with investors perhaps enjoying the calm before the storm of data and earnings brought by the first few days of August. Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit and ISM manufacturing PMIs are joined by Fed-favourite inflation gauge the core PCE price index and, most crucially, Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest earnings update. Wednesday then has the ADP employment change reading, before Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s double dose of services PMIs and, finally, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm jobs report. In other words, plenty to challenge the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent rise. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing activity index has climbed from 15 in June to 16.8 in July, much better than the expected fall to 13. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose 11 points to 22.8, indicating output grew at a faster pace than in June, said the Dallas Fed. But the positive data, there were more mixed responses from respondents: Business is good, not great. We are busy. The foreign competition for new equipment is extremely competitive and our company is not able to match their selling prices. Things are going poorly in the economy. We have no projects, and business is slow. We are experiencing the summertime blues. Business is very dull July to date. Washington, D.C., is still a significant contingent factor for a better or worse outlook. Prospects for better are dimming. The increases in business are small but measurable. We have been trying to add employees over the last six months, with no qualified candidates available. I cannot explain it, but we are slower than we have ever been at this time and it seems like we are not the only ones. Next on the agenda are the latest US housing figures, which have come in better than expected. Pending home sales bounced back in June after three months of decline. The National Association of Realtors said that its index of contracts to buy previously owned homes jumped1.5% to a reading of 110.2. This was higher than the 0.7% rise that analysts had been forecasting. But the market remains limited by the number of houses available to buy. Lawrence Yun, the NAR chief economist said: The first half of 2017 ended with a nearly identical number of contract signings as one year ago, even as the economy added 2.2 million net new jobs. Market conditions in many areas continue to be fast paced, with few properties to choose from, which is forcing buyers to act almost immediately on an available home that fits their criteria. Low supply is an ongoing issue holding back activity. Housing inventory declined last month and is a staggering 7.1 percent lower than a year ago. The fall in the Chicago PMI follows five straight months of rises, and is the lowest level for three months. Jamie Satchi, economist at MNI Indicators which helps compile the report, said: MNI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July Chicago Business Barometer should be viewed in the context of the underlying, upward trend in business sentiment witnessed since early 2016. Key indicators, despite reversing their June reading, remain above their respective averages set over the last twelve months, and point towards robust confidence among U.S firms. Still with the US and there is a smidgen of data due. First comes the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which has come in lower than expected, down from 65.7 in June to 58.9 in July. Optimism about US company earnings has helped push Wall Street higher once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intraday peak of 21,885, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are both on the rise in early trading. So far around 73% of major companies reporting results have beaten expectations, and Apple is the next big name to come under the spotlight, with its results due after the market closes on Tuesday. Thurday sees the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate and monetary policy decisions, and ING Bank has been looking at the possibilities. And they have felt moved to drag in Game of Thrones for some reason: In another important development, UK consumer borrowing is back above \u00c2\u00a3200bn for the first time since the financial crash. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest Bank of England figures, released this morning. Unsecured consumer credit, which includes credit cards, car loans and overdrafts, grew by 10% in the year to June, to \u00c2\u00a3200.9bn. It was the first time the outstanding debt had gone above \u00c2\u00a3200bn since the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008. The pace of growth in consumer credit did ease off slightly in June, going up by \u00c2\u00a31.5bn on the month after \u00c2\u00a31.8bn in May. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics said the 10% rise on the year would still be concerning for the Bank. Gregory says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will clearly do nothing to allay policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears that unsecured credit is growing too quickly. But this at least suggests that households remain confident enough in their financial position to increase borrowing to help smooth consumption, as their real incomes are temporarily squeezed by higher inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has sounded the alarm over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer credit market. It has downgraded the outlook on bonds backed by credit card customers, buy-to-let mortgages and car loans, and warned that some British borrowers will struggle to repay their debt as the economy weakens, and inflation eats into their salaries. In a new report Greg Davies, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistant vice president, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Household debt is high and still growing, leaving consumers vulnerable to an economic downturn, while higher inflation, weaker wage growth and levels of indebtedness leaves those in lower-income brackets the most exposed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An additional challenge is that households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capacity to draw on savings to maintain consumption and/or service their consumer debts has significantly diminished.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a result, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has downgraded the collateral outlooks on most \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcUK structured finance sectors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to negative. It believes they will perform negatively over the next 12 to 18 months. Structured finance is the process of taking a large number of individual loans, packaging them into a single security, and selling it to investors. In theory, this allows investors to get a guaranteed income stream, but with the danger of losses if the underlying loans underperform (as happened spectacularly in the subprime crisis of 2008). These are the areas which Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is worried about: Non-prime residential mortgages bonds: These borrowers are paying higher interest rates, and have smaller savings pots to absorb any shocks, says Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Bonds backed by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buy-to-let (BTL) sector: Bondholders could suffer losses if house prices fall, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the high proportion of interest-only underlying loans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Automobile asset-backed securities: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delinquencies are likely to rise slightly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the economy deteriorates. It singles out the boom in Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) plans, which have allowed customers with poor credit histories to buy new cars. Credit card asset-backed securities: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects delinquencies and defaults on these bonds to rise, especially if unemployment increases. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning comes just a few hours after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Conduct Authority announced it would review the booming car loan market, amid worries that consumer debt is getting out of hand. Newsflash: Officials from the Bank of England and the Unite union have sat down at conciliation firm ACAS. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a final attempt to stop a three-day walkout at the Bank, starting tomorrow, over a 1% pay offer to Unite staff. The threat of US sanctions on Venezuela has alarmed investors, sending them racing to ditch bonds issued by Caracas. The price of long-term Venezuelan dollar bonds fell almost one cent, according to Reuters data. Bonds issued by state oil firm Petr\u00c3\u00b3leos de Venezuela also took a tumble. It buys US light crude oil, and mixes it with its own crude to create a product for export - so any sanctions would hurt the company. Meanwhile, the European Union has added its voice to the chorus of concerns over Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote: Marc Br\u00c3\u00bctsch, chief economist at Swiss Life, says the drop in eurozone unemployment shows that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is strengthening: Ken Odeluga of City Index says the data has cheered investors. But Craig Erlam of OANDA points out that the eurozone has plenty of room for improvement: Unemployment at 9.1% is still extremely high and when you break that down by country, it becomes much higher again in some places. Core inflation is also only at 1.3% which is still well below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target and with the currency appreciating strongly this year, downward pressures here will continue to build. The central bank should therefore tread very carefully when it comes to removing stimulus, as I expect it will. In another encouraging sign, youth unemployment across the eurozone has fallen by 400,000 over the last year. There are now 2.588 million young people out of work in the euro area, or 18.7% of the youth population, down from 21% in June 2016. The lowest youth unemployment rate is in Germany (6.7%), while the highest were recorded in Greece (45.5% in April 2017), Spain (39.2%) and Italy (35.4%). Boom! Unemployment across the eurozone has fallen to a new eight-year low. The euro area jobless rate has dropped to 9.1% in June, down from 9.2% in May. This level was last seen in February 2009, after the financial crisis drove Europe into recession. It indicates that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is continuing to strengthen, on the back of solid growth figures from France and Spain last week. Unemployment in the wider European Union was stable at 7.7%, the lowest since December 2008. Despite this recovery, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate is still much higher than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.5% or the US, where it is just 4.4%. There are also stark regional differences, between Northern and Southern Europe: Eurostat has more details: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in June 2017 were recorded in the Czech Republic (2,9%), Germany (3.8%) and Malta (4.1%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (21.7% in April 2017) and Spain (17.1%). Separate data shows that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained at 1.3% in July, some way below the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just below 2%. Newsflash: Back in the UK, the number of mortgages being approved has dipped to a nine-month low. A total of 64,684 new home loans were agreed in June, new figures from the Bank of England show, down from 65,109 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since September 2016. The figures also show that the public continued to rack up credit. Net consumer credit rose by \u00c2\u00a31.458bn in June from \u00c2\u00a31.769bn in May. That means consumer credit is growing by around 10% per year. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted the key charts: As this chart shows, Venezuela is the third-largest exporter of oil into the US market: Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances have been badly hurt by the fall in the oil price a couple of years ago. That loss of revenue has fuelled the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political and economic crisis, as RBC Capital Markets explain: Many petro states have seen their finances severely strained by the oil price slump. However, no country has experienced as fast and furious fall as Venezuela has, and it now appears poised to earn the dubious distinction of being the first to fully fail. The statistics are staggering. By the end of the 2017, the Venezuelan economy will likely have shrunk by 30% in three years. The IMF forecasts that inflation will average 720% this year and top 2,000% in 2018. Half of the population is living in extreme poverty and health officials are even starting to warn of famine if current trends continue, according to the International Crisis Group. Three months of daily demonstrations and strikes have left more than a hundred dead and thousands injured. Thousands more are languishing in jail. Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new assembly will give President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters \u00e2\u20ac\u0153near-total\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd control of the levers of power, say Associated Press. AP also report that opposition parties don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that over 40% of the public voted: Council president Tibisay Lucena announced just before midnight that turnout in Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote was 41.53 percent, or 8,089,320 people. The count was met with mockery and anger from members of the opposition, who said they believed between 2 million and 3 million people voted. One well-respected independent analysis said 3.6 million appeared to have voted. The electoral council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote counts in the past have traditionally been seen as reliable and generally accurate, but Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement appeared certain to escalate the polarization and political conflict paralyzing the country. UK foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan has tweeted that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the events in Venezuela: My colleague Sibylla Brodzinsky has written about the deadly clashes on the streets of Venezuela during Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting. Many voters decided against taking part in an election the opposition said would turn the country into a full-fledged dictatorship. As many as 14 people died in the protests, according to opposition leader Henrique Capriles, and the prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office confirmed at least six people were killed by gunfire, including one national guardsman. Seven policemen were wounded in an explosion in the opposition stronghold neighbourhood of Altamira. However, the leader of the ruling socialist party, Jorge Rodriguez, said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not one death related to the voting process today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, underscoring the contrasting versions of the day presented by the two clashing sides. This chart shows how the Venezuela crisis has driven oil to a two-month high: The oil price is rallying this morning, following reports that the US government could hit Venezuela with sanctions. Brent crude has jumped to $52.85 per barrel, its highest level since late May, and US crude is back over the $50/barrel mark. The surge comes after US officials expressed anger over a controversial election held in Venezuela last weekend to choose delegates for its assembly, and to rewrite its constitution. Critics claimed that the vote was designed to shore up president Nicolas Maduro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. It was marred by violent clashes between opposition supporters and troops, with at least three people killed over the weekend. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, has already warned Maduro that the result isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acceptable. US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert also warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela, including those who participate in the National Constituent Assembly as a result of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flawed election,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We encourage governments in the hemisphere and around the world to take strong action to hold accountable those who undermine democracy, deny human rights,bear responsibility for violence and repression, or engage in corrupt practices. And a formal US response is expected soon, with officials briefing that they could impose sanctions on Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital oil sector this week. Reuters has more details: The measures, which could be announced as early as Monday, are not expected to include a ban on Venezuelan oil shipments to the United States -- one of the harshest options -- but could block sale of lighter U.S. crude that Venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports, the officials told Reuters. More reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with new figures showing how much new credit was lapped up by consumer last month, and how many people took out mortgages. With concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy mounting, City investors will scrutinise the data for signs that cash-strapped households are taking too many risks. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the City predictions: Mortgage approvals for June are set to remain steady at 65k, while net lending is expected to slow down a touch from the numbers seen in May, as declining consumer confidence and rising inflation squeezes wages, not to mention the uncertainty created by the June election result. The main event of the morning, though, could be the latest eurozone inflation and jobs report. They could show that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is continues, with unemployment tipped to hit a new post-crisis low of 9.2% in June. Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysts warn that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market still has black spots: The pace of improvement is still gradual, due in particular to the continued sluggish performance of the French and Italian labour markets, meaning that the considerable degree of labour market slack that exists in the euro area continues to be absorbed only slowly. Eurozone inflation, meanwhile, is expected to remain at 1.3% in July -- not high enough to worry the European Central Bank unduly. Also, the Bank of England will make a final attempt to avert its first strike in half a century. The central bank will meet with union officials today, with a three-day walkout over pay due to start tomorrow: The agenda 9.30am BST: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals for June 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for June 10am BST: Eurozone inflation data for July 3pm BST: US pending home sales",
