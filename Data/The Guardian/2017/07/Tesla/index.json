It\u2019s sufficiently long to be taken seriously and give the industry time to adjust.\u201d</p> <p>He said that by 2040 carmakers would have switched over to battery-powered vehicles regardless of the government\u2019s announcement. But in the short term, he said ministers needed to do more to ease that switch.</p> <p>\u201cI think where they [carmakers] probably have a point is the government isn\u2019t doing enough to incentivise people to switch over to electric cars and hybrids in the short term,\u201d said Bailey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32439e8c86f51fbf45f2ffec40cb8f694faa5634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32439e8c86f51fbf45f2ffec40cb8f694faa5634/114_0_3026_1816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An electric car charging point: motorists are offered a \u00a34,500 government grant on fully electric cars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An electric car charging point: motorists are offered a \u00a34,500 government grant on fully electric cars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Motorists are offered a \u00a34,500 government grant off the price of fully electric cars (down from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/01/electric-car-grant-uk\">\u00a35,000 when the scheme launched in 2011</a>) and \u00a32,500 for plug-in hybrids, which can run a short distance on a battery before switching to a conventional engine. </p> <p>Bailey said the scheme should stay until the 2020s. Research by <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/electric-vehicles-to-be-35-of-global-new-car-sales-by-2040/\">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a> suggests that will be the decade when there is a tipping point as the total cost of owning an electric car \u2013 including refuelling and maintenance, as well as buying the vehicle \u2013 becomes cheaper than combustion engine vehicles without subsidies.<br></p> <p>BMW, which on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/25/bmw-pledges-build-new-e-mini-uk-car-plant-cowley\">announced it would make its fully electric mini in Oxford</a>, said it was on track to sell 100,000 fully and partially electric vehicles around the world this year, up from 62,000 in 2016. \u201cWe see electric powertrains as the future for our industry,\u201d a spokesman said. Nissan said it welcomed the move by ministers.</p> <p>However, one luxury carmaker branded the government\u2019s plans \u201cabsurd\u201d because some drivers need to travel long distances. The average range of a new electric car is 100-150 miles, although some of <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/models\">Tesla\u2019s cars</a> can now run for more than 300 miles between charges.</p> <p>Andy Palmer, chief executive of Aston Martin, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daea4433-9819-3ec5-afa8-f68f4f4b9c57\">told the Financial Times</a>: \u201cIf the government is going to legislate then they have to assist as well, otherwise they will destroy part of the industry.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford of Britain, told the Guardian: \u201cOur product plans very much support that kind of timeline. A 23-year period is a good notice period.\u201d </p> <p>But he said despite the UK and France announcing a phase-out of new petrol and diesels by 2040, there was \u201cnot a global movement at this point in time\u201d to ban them.</p> <p>The British car industry said it could only hit the 2040 deadline if consumers wanted electric cars. \u201c[Demand is] still at a very low level as consumers have concerns over affordability, range and charging points,\u201d said Hawes.</p> <p>According to a survey of 2,134 drivers, only 2% of people are thinking of buying a pure electric model as their next car. The main reason given for not considering one was cost, followed by concerns over range and the time needed for recharging. </p> <p>The survey, for insurance firm Aviva, also showed that, after VW\u2019s emission scandal and amid concerns over pollution, drivers are turning away from diesel: 68% said their next car would be petrol, with only 21% choosing diesel. New car sales are currently split roughly half and half between petrol and diesel.</p> <p>This year so far, fully electric cars accounted for 0.5% of all new registrations, plug-in hybrids accounted for 1% and hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, 2.6%. </p> <p>While only 37,000 of the 26m cars on British roads now are pure electric, they are growing at an astonishing rate: <a href=\"https://www.smmt.co.uk/2017/07/june-2017-ev-registrations/\">SMMT figures for last month show they were up 46% on June 2016</a>.</p> <p>Some carmakers will do better than others out of the transition the government wants.

                "bodyText":"Britain\u2019s car industry has warned that the government\u2019s proposed ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 risks damaging the industry and stalling sales of new cars. Mike Hawes, chief of executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders trade body, said that carmakers were working with ministers on the switch to electric cars but called for the government to use carrots rather than sticks. \u201cOutright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector, which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, so the industry instead wants a positive approach, which gives consumers incentives to purchase these cars. \u201cWe could undermine the UK\u2019s successful automotive sector if we don\u2019t allow enough time for the industry to adjust,\u201d he said. However, experts said two decades was plenty of time for carmakers to evolve away from the internal combustion engine. Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: \u201cI think that\u2019s more than enough time. It\u2019s sufficiently long to be taken seriously and give the industry time to adjust.\u201d He said that by 2040 carmakers would have switched over to battery-powered vehicles regardless of the government\u2019s announcement. But in the short term, he said ministers needed to do more to ease that switch. \u201cI think where they [carmakers] probably have a point is the government isn\u2019t doing enough to incentivise people to switch over to electric cars and hybrids in the short term,\u201d said Bailey. Motorists are offered a \u00a34,500 government grant off the price of fully electric cars (down from \u00a35,000 when the scheme launched in 2011) and \u00a32,500 for plug-in hybrids, which can run a short distance on a battery before switching to a conventional engine. Bailey said the scheme should stay until the 2020s. Research by Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggests that will be the decade when there is a tipping point as the total cost of owning an electric car \u2013 including refuelling and maintenance, as well as buying the vehicle \u2013 becomes cheaper than combustion engine vehicles without subsidies. BMW, which on Tuesday announced it would make its fully electric mini in Oxford, said it was on track to sell 100,000 fully and partially electric vehicles around the world this year, up from 62,000 in 2016. \u201cWe see electric powertrains as the future for our industry,\u201d a spokesman said. Nissan said it welcomed the move by ministers. However, one luxury carmaker branded the government\u2019s plans \u201cabsurd\u201d because some drivers need to travel long distances. The average range of a new electric car is 100-150 miles, although some of Tesla\u2019s cars can now run for more than 300 miles between charges. Andy Palmer, chief executive of Aston Martin, told the Financial Times: \u201cIf the government is going to legislate then they have to assist as well, otherwise they will destroy part of the industry.\u201d Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford of Britain, told the Guardian: \u201cOur product plans very much support that kind of timeline. A 23-year period is a good notice period.\u201d But he said despite the UK and France announcing a phase-out of new petrol and diesels by 2040, there was \u201cnot a global movement at this point in time\u201d to ban them. The British car industry said it could only hit the 2040 deadline if consumers wanted electric cars. \u201c[Demand is] still at a very low level as consumers have concerns over affordability, range and charging points,\u201d said Hawes. According to a survey of 2,134 drivers, only 2% of people are thinking of buying a pure electric model as their next car. The main reason given for not considering one was cost, followed by concerns over range and the time needed for recharging. The survey, for insurance firm Aviva, also showed that, after VW\u2019s emission scandal and amid concerns over pollution, drivers are turning away from diesel: 68% said their next car would be petrol, with only 21% choosing diesel. New car sales are currently split roughly half and half between petrol and diesel. This year so far, fully electric cars accounted for 0.5% of all new registrations, plug-in hybrids accounted for 1% and hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, 2.6%. While only 37,000 of the 26m cars on British roads now are pure electric, they are growing at an astonishing rate: SMMT figures for last month show they were up 46% on June 2016. Some carmakers will do better than others out of the transition the government wants. Bailey said that Renault-Nissan, BMW and Volvo, which recently said it would only launch electrified new cars from 2019 onwards, had already gone a \u201clong way\u201d towards a battery-powered future. Ford, by comparison, had been \u201cvery slow\u201d, he said. Ultimately, it was too early to say who would win out, he said. \u201cWho survives and who prospers? We just don\u2019t know at this point.\u201d Ben Lane, director of the site Next Green Car, said VW was also emerging as a leader on electric cars as a result of the emissions scandal over its diesel models. \u201cAt the bottom of the list is Ford.

Prof Andrew Parkes of Coventry University said the signal the government had sent \u201ccreates a huge opportunity for the UK to lead in the design and development of a new generation of zero-emission and autonomous vehicles\u201d. Chris Gubbey, chief executive of the London Electric Vehicle Company, which is making the new, electrified black cab at a \u00a3325m factory in Coventry, said Britain already had an \u201cexciting, dynamic\u201d electric car sector \u2013 and so would benefit from the switchover.",
