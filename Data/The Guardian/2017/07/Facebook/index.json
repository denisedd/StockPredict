                "body":"<p>ITV is banking on hits including Love Island and returning drama Victoria to attract viewers as it faces the worst year for UK TV advertising in almost a decade.</p> <p>The broadcaster said TV advertising slumped 8% to \u00a3769m in the first half of the year \u2013 the worst fall since the final quarter of 2008 \u2013 and blamed marketers for holding back budgets due to \u201congoing economic and political uncertainty\u201d. ITV\u2019s pre-tax profits slumped 16% to \u00a3259m in the first six months of 2017.</p> <p>June was a particularly difficult month, with advertising revenue plummeting 18% year on year against a tough comparison with the same month in 2016, when ITV had European Championship football coverage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/26/itv-chairman-says-it-will-never-reveal-how-much-it-pays-its-stars\">ITV chairman says it will never reveal how much it pays its stars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>ITV said it expected to perform better in the third quarter, with TV ad revenue improving to a 4% decline. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The broadcaster praised the performance of Love Island \u2013 which set viewing records for ITV2 and drove its share of advertising viewed by 16- to 34-year-olds, who are leaving traditional TV in droves, by 15%.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>ITV\u2019s chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/11/peter-bazalgette-big-brother-challenge\">responsible for bringing Big Brother to the UK</a>, said the show had its own identity as escape TV as the public faces increasingly tough economic times.</p> <p>\u201cLove Island is Love Island,\u201d said Bazalgette, who admitted he was one of the 2.6 million viewers of Monday night\u2019s final. \u201cIt is a really delightful show. I think it hits the mood of the times. It is romantic, positive, upbeat. Love Island demonstrates that young viewers engage in great TV content.\u201d</p> <p> The show has spawned catchphrases such as \u201c100% my type on paper\u201d, which Primark has struck a deal to use as a slogan on clothing, and more than 75,000 of the personalisable water bottles given to the contestants have been sold. The show, which ran from early June, will help the broadcaster\u2019s performance in the second half of the year.</p> <p>ITV said the second half of the year would prove to be better with a \u201cbuild-up of programme stock\u201d, including Victoria and Cold Feet, set to bolster its advertising performance.</p> <p>The broadcaster saw a healthy 4% bump in share price in early trading as analysts, who had factored in the poor first half performance, were buoyed by more positive outlook for the second half of the year.</p> <p>Analysts expect ITV\u2019s ad revenue to be down about 6% for the full year, which will be its worst annual performance since a 9.4% fall in 2009. However, the broadcaster said it expected to outperform the wider UK TV ad market.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe are in a very different environment to then [2009],\u201d said finance chief Ian Griffith, who is running ITV as chief operating officer until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/17/carolyn-mccall-itv-chief-executive-easyjet-adam-crozier\">the arrival of Carolyn McCall to replace Adam Crozier as chief executive in January</a>. \u201cWe are a much more scaled and resilient business.

                "bodyText":"ITV is banking on hits including Love Island and returning drama Victoria to attract viewers as it faces the worst year for UK TV advertising in almost a decade. The broadcaster said TV advertising slumped 8% to \u00a3769m in the first half of the year \u2013 the worst fall since the final quarter of 2008 \u2013 and blamed marketers for holding back budgets due to \u201congoing economic and political uncertainty\u201d. ITV\u2019s pre-tax profits slumped 16% to \u00a3259m in the first six months of 2017. June was a particularly difficult month, with advertising revenue plummeting 18% year on year against a tough comparison with the same month in 2016, when ITV had European Championship football coverage. ITV said it expected to perform better in the third quarter, with TV ad revenue improving to a 4% decline. The broadcaster praised the performance of Love Island \u2013 which set viewing records for ITV2 and drove its share of advertising viewed by 16- to 34-year-olds, who are leaving traditional TV in droves, by 15%. ITV\u2019s chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, responsible for bringing Big Brother to the UK, said the show had its own identity as escape TV as the public faces increasingly tough economic times. \u201cLove Island is Love Island,\u201d said Bazalgette, who admitted he was one of the 2.6 million viewers of Monday night\u2019s final. \u201cIt is a really delightful show. I think it hits the mood of the times. It is romantic, positive, upbeat. Love Island demonstrates that young viewers engage in great TV content.\u201d The show has spawned catchphrases such as \u201c100% my type on paper\u201d, which Primark has struck a deal to use as a slogan on clothing, and more than 75,000 of the personalisable water bottles given to the contestants have been sold. The show, which ran from early June, will help the broadcaster\u2019s performance in the second half of the year. ITV said the second half of the year would prove to be better with a \u201cbuild-up of programme stock\u201d, including Victoria and Cold Feet, set to bolster its advertising performance. The broadcaster saw a healthy 4% bump in share price in early trading as analysts, who had factored in the poor first half performance, were buoyed by more positive outlook for the second half of the year. Analysts expect ITV\u2019s ad revenue to be down about 6% for the full year, which will be its worst annual performance since a 9.4% fall in 2009. However, the broadcaster said it expected to outperform the wider UK TV ad market. \u201cWe are in a very different environment to then [2009],\u201d said finance chief Ian Griffith, who is running ITV as chief operating officer until the arrival of Carolyn McCall to replace Adam Crozier as chief executive in January. \u201cWe are a much more scaled and resilient business. We are very different compared to the last time the market had to face a downturn in advertising.\u201d Bazalgette said he expects McCall, who joins from easyJet on 8 January, to lead a \u201crefresh\u201d at ITV. However, he added that the broadcaster would stick to its current strategy of diversifying away from a reliance on advertising by expanding its TV production business, ITV Studios, and building online revenues. \u201cEvery strategy of every company benefits from being refreshed and that is the job we will be doing with Carolyn McCall in the new year,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, we do wish to be an integrated producer broadcaster, we do wish to rebalance the company and we do wish to continue to strengthen our studios business.\u201d Griffith said he had not seen a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in ad spend from Google or Facebook into TV following widespread concerns about ads running online next to inappropriate content such as extremist material and fake news. Asked about the threat of Netflix, which last week announced strong growth breaking the 100 million global subscriber mark, Bazalgette classified it as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d. ITV competes with services such as Netflix for viewers but also produces and sells it shows through ITV Studios, maker of shows including The Voice, Come Dine With Me and Coronation Street. \u201cITV family [of channels] has a 21% share of viewing in the UK, Netflix [if it was measured] would have a 4% share,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the share [size] of one of the healthier digital channels.\u201d ITV also said that it intends to press ahead with trying to force Virgin Media to pay to carry its channels, after an arcane law that protects cable platforms from having to pay copyright or retransmission fees to public service broadcasters is repealed on 31 July. Analysts optimistically hope that ITV can make tens of million of pounds charging retransmission fees not just to Virgin Media, but also other rivals. \u201cFrom [31 July] we look forward to negotiating for proper value on all channels,\u201d said Bazalgette.",
