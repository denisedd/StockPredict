We recognise that in some of these cases we have not provided our best standard of customer service and have taken too long to rectify customer issues, for which we apologise.\u201d</p> <p>Bovis, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, added that a \u201climited number of customers were offered an incentive to complete before the year end and all homes were habitable with the requisite CML industry certification, with a timetable for outstanding finishing works to be carried out in the new year.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>The firm insisted that no one was forced to move in before Christmas and that the homes only needed some finishing touches. \u201cCustomers were clearly free to decide their preferred course of action.

                "bodyText":"Bovis Homes has been accused of pressuring customers to move into unfinished houses before Christmas by offering them cash incentives, a week before it issued a profit warning. Several Bovis customers said they had been offered cheques of \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000, or other incentives, if they completed on their house purchases before 23 December. Members of the Bovis Homes Victims Group on Facebook, which also has a YouTube channel, have swelled to 650, with 244 people joining in the last two months. Marc Holden, one of the group\u2019s administrators, said: \u201cWe were getting a lot of people joining the group just before Christmas who were posting about being \u2018encouraged\u2019 to complete by 23 December, some were being offered money and other incentives.\u201d He said a group of at least 30 disgruntled Bovis customers would stage a protest at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Tunbridge Wells on 2 May. A company spokesman said: \u201cBovis Homes is fully aware of the customer group and their complaints, and we take these issues very seriously. We recognise that in some of these cases we have not provided our best standard of customer service and have taken too long to rectify customer issues, for which we apologise.\u201d Bovis, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, added that a \u201climited number of customers were offered an incentive to complete before the year end and all homes were habitable with the requisite CML industry certification, with a timetable for outstanding finishing works to be carried out in the new year.\u201d The firm insisted that no one was forced to move in before Christmas and that the homes only needed some finishing touches. \u201cCustomers were clearly free to decide their preferred course of action. The group often offers a range of incentives at sale and completion in line with industry practice,\u201d the spokesman said. The housebuilder\u2019s chief executive David Ritchie quit on Monday, less than a week after the group issued its profit warning. It warned last Wednesday that it would complete about 180 fewer homes than expected in 2016, blaming operational issues. This will affect profits \u2013 Bovis now expects to make an annual pre-tax profit of \u00a3160m to \u00a3170m, compared with analysts\u2019 forecasts of about \u00a3183m. One couple was offered a post-completion cheque of \u00a32,000 if they could legally complete on their property by 23 December, according to an email seen by the Guardian. Comments from other customers suggest the homes lacked more than just finishing touches. Chad Clifton said he and his wife were \u201cforced\u201d to complete on their four-bedroom house in Brockworth, Gloucestershire on 23 December and found the fridge had not been fitted yet and that the hallway was unfinished, out of a list of 115 defects. They were offered \u00a3350 and a free move. \u201cWe were told we didn\u2019t have much choice \u2013 if the house is ready we have to complete on 23r December.\u201d None of the defects have been fixed yet but Clifton said the couple \u201clove the house\u201d and that the customer service had improved vastly after his wife sent a scathing letter to Bovis\u2019s head office. Another Bovis customer said he and his wife had been offered \u00a33,000 if they completed on 23 December, but declined the offer because of numerous problems (such as the wrong kitchen being fitted) at the \u00a3320,000 three-bedroom property in Inkberrow, Worcestershire. The couple are still waiting for the problems to be rectified and to complete on the purchase. He said they had not been offered any compensation despite the stress caused, time taken off work and the cost of extending storage.

We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u2019s conference will be rising inequality, which the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\"> WEF has warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\">is the biggest problem facing the world. </a>The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, had led the west to \u201ca tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d.</p> <p>The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u201cCombating rising insecurity and inequality\u201d, to be introduced by the WEF\u2019s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u201cvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u201d. </p> <p>The extra Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re staff include \u201cspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u201d, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. </p> <p>The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u2019s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u201cThere are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u201cWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIce sculptures are always part of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/ilo-warns-of-rise-in-social-unrest-and-migration-as-inequality-widens\">ILO warns of rise in social unrest and migration as inequality widens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. </p> <p>\u201cI assume [the staff] get good tips,\u201d Kleber said, but \u201cmost of them are not coming for the money \u2013 they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u2026 Of course it\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u2019s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th US president.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2016/01/22/jack_ma_davos_party.php\">Cameron was photographed partying</a> tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events.</p> <p>Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. </p> <p>To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/strategic-partners\">Strategic Partners</a> of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. </p> <p>Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Annual_Report_2015-2016.pdf\">its annual report</a>. </p> <p>The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u2019s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u2019s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/economics-blog/2017/jan/11/are-americans-more-ready-to-accept-inequality-donald-trump\">Are Americans more ready to accept inequality?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u2019s parties as \u201cendless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u201d. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u2019s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u2019s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World.</p> <p>Many of this year\u2019s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/china-xi-jinping-world-economic-forum-davos-donald-trump\">China\u2019s two richest men</a>, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00fcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them.</p> <p>Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. </p> <p>The increase in private jet flights \u2013 which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u2013 comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2017\">annual global risks report</a> the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before.</p> <p>Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00a37,860. \u201cClients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos.

Kleber said the extra staff have been flown in from partner hotels across the world to help out during the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re\u2019s busiest week of the year, but because the whole of Davos is packed out with forum visitors there isn\u2019t much space to accommodate the additional workers. \u201cWe have a staff house, but at this time of the year it is getting cosy,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe do have some different places with four or five people in one room. We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u201d Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u2019s conference will be rising inequality, which the WEF has warned is the biggest problem facing the world. The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, had led the west to \u201ca tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d. The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u201cCombating rising insecurity and inequality\u201d, to be introduced by the WEF\u2019s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u201cvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u201d. The extra Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re staff include \u201cspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u201d, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u2019s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver. Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u201cThere are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u201d he said. The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u201cWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIce sculptures are always part of it.\u201d Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. \u201cI assume [the staff] get good tips,\u201d Kleber said, but \u201cmost of them are not coming for the money \u2013 they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u2026 Of course it\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he added. Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u2019s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th US president. Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, Cameron was photographed partying tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events. Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become Strategic Partners of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to its annual report. The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u2019s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u2019s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u2019s parties as \u201cendless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u201d. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u2019s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u2019s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World. Many of this year\u2019s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, China\u2019s two richest men, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00fcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them. Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. The increase in private jet flights \u2013 which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u2013 comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its annual global risks report the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before. Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00a37,860. \u201cClients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos. The parties there have become a place to be. Davos is now on \u2018the circuit\u2019 along with the Superbowl, the Champions League final and the Monaco Grand Prix.\u201d The rich and powerful at Davos Christine Lagarde The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a firm fixture at the WEF, and will participate in at least three panels at this year\u2019s conference including \u201cSqueezed and Angry: How to fix the middle-class crisis\u201d, and another on how to \u201cchallenge stereotypes and institutional inertia to achieve gender parity within our lifetimes\u201d, as well as being keynote speaker on the wider challenges facing the economy this year. Lagarde, formerly a French minister, was recently found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u2019 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence. The court decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support. Theresa May The UK prime minister will be at Davos for the first time this year. May is not listed to appear on any panels, and the No 10 press office declined to provide any details of May\u2019s itinerary. David Cameron used his speech at Davos last year to reassure global business leaders that Britain would stay in the European Union. Cameron said he wanted to \u201cconfront this issue, I want to deal with it\u201d. \u201cMy aim is absolutely clear: I want to secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union,\u201d he said. Shakira The Grammy award-winning Colombian singer-songwriter will be at Davos in her role as a global ambassador for Unicef. She follows in the footsteps of other celebrities, including Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am, who have spoken at Davos to promote their charitable interests. Shakira will be promoting her Pies Descalzos / Barefoot Foundation, which helps provide education to poor and vulnerable children. Matt Damon The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting actor will be at Davos to talk about his continuing efforts to provide clean water to developing countries. Damon, who founded charity Water.org, will speak at a session hosted by CNBC. In 2014, Damon told Davos that having travelled in developing countries he \u201cstarted to get a real appreciation for the magnitude of the water crisis\u201d. Xi Jinping The Chinese president will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to Davos. He is the first Chinese president to attend the WEF, and his visit is a statement of intent that China wants to assume a global leadership role as other world powers struggle with domestic tumult. Joe Biden The outgoing US vice-president will be at Davos, which runs until Friday \u2013 the same day as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Biden, who will travel to Switzerland on Air Force 2, will \u201cdeliver remarks on the cancer moonshot and deliver an address on foreign policy\u201d, the White House said. Sheryl Sandberg The chief operating officer of Facebook, who has amassed a $1.3bn fortune from the social network according to Forbes, will speak at a panel about how older world leaders can harness the optimism of youth. The panel also includes: Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard; Last King of Scotland actor Forest Whitaker, and Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia. Sir Martin Sorrell Britain\u2019s best-paid boss \u2013 who collected \u00a370.5m from his advertising company WPP last year \u2013 will speak at a panel entitled \u201cSize Matters: The Future of Big Business\u201d. They will discuss how \u201cfewer than 10% of the world\u2019s public companies account for 80% of all profits. What does operating at this scale mean for competition, collaboration and innovation?\u201d Eric Schmidt The chairman of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is a regular at Davos, although he is not lined up to speak at any panels this year. Schmidt, 61, is the world\u2019s 36th richest man with a $11bn fortune, according to Forbes. Jack Ma The founder of Chinese internet group Alibaba is China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Last year he hosted a lavish party attended by David Cameron, Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey. Jamie Oliver The British celebrity chef-turned businessman will be interviewed by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington about \u201cdriving a healthy and sustainable food revolution\u201d. Oliver, who is worth $400m according to the Sunday Times rich list, was recently forced to close six of his Italian restaurants after tough trading and the \u201cpressures and unknowns\u201d following the Brexit vote. Khalid al-Falih Saudia Arabia\u2019s energy minister will be in demand as a key voice on Opec after the oil-producing countries recently agreed to cut output sending oil prices soaring. Al-Falih, who is also chairman of state oil and gas giant Saudi Aramco, has been put in charge of leading Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 \u2013 the country\u2019s plan to diversify away from oil dependency.",

Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.

The others are Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.

The pound is currently down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2304 and 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1521. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trading on the FTSE was muted the day after suffering its biggest loss in six months. The British pound, drifting lower in a correction of its biggest daily gain since 2008, helped the UK equity benchmark to modest gains.</p> <p>We view the move in the British pound following Prime Minister\u2019s speech as a game-changer and as such don\u2019t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100.

Nina Skero, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now stands at 74.5%.</p> <p>The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher than in December 2015.</p> <p>With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending by reducing head counts.</p> <p>On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by inflation.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12a7e6083aaa417a392190b443e07f9dddc22a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12a7e6083aaa417a392190b443e07f9dddc22a5e/598_201_4714_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global Warming Images/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy.

As with the inflation data yesterday, this development won\u2019t ease the MPC\u2019s concerns about the anticipated period of above-target CPI.</p> <p>In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 31.9/wk...</p> <p>As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is that the headwinds we have identified don\u2019t materialise as quickly as expected at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining impressive at the end of 2016. That is likely to lead the Bank of England to revise up its GDP forecast at the February <em>Inflation Report</em> but the scale of any such optimistic revisions should be tempered given the context of less encouraging news on the quantity of labour being used in the economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-587f4354e4b0f0efb00f52ae\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-18T10:37:58.266Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sadiq Khan to fight 'hard Brexit' at Davos</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>London mayor Sadiq Khan is in Davos today, as part of his push to protect the capital, and its financial centre, from harm from Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.</p> <p>He\u2019s holding various meeting, and will also address business leaders tonight at a Morgan Stanley dinner.</p> <p><strong>According to his office, he will say:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cSecuring privileged access to the single market must be the top priority for the negotiations.

                "bodyText":"The official Davos sessions are now over for the day, although there are plenty of working dinners taking place (most off the record, alas). In the hall, it\u2019s Dalian Night - with trays of delicious Chinese food* for the throng, washed down with wine or Tsingtao beer. *stir-fried beef, cabbage and celery, oodles of noodles, with Lychees and Tapioka-coconut pudding and mango to follow. So that\u2019s all from us for today, unless any major news breaks out. Back tomorrow for Theresa May\u2019s special address to Davos, and a lot more.... GW It wouldn\u2019t be Davos without a dose of eurozone angst; and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, has provided it. Dimon told Bloomberg TV tonight that the euro area could break up unless politicians address the populist anger that has built up. He said: \u201cWhat went wrong is going wrong for everybody, not just going wrong for Britain, but in some ways it looks like they\u2019re kind of doubling down. [Unless leaders address underlying concerns] you\u2019re going to have the same political things about immigration, the laws of the country, how much power goes to Brussels.\u201d The United States may flip at the end of this week from being a climate leader, to being the leading climate change denier, says Thomas Friedman, the author chairing the climate change session. How will Trump\u2019s election, and the changes in Europe, affect the climate agenda? Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, is optimistic that Brexit won\u2019t change the climate agenda I believe the Brits are going to continue being active on this, and that my sister party the Conservatives will hold firm to an agenda against emissions. But the United States could be a different story once Trump is in charge. The Paris Agreement is in place, it\u2019s a long process to get out of it. But of course, not implementing it is a possibility for a new administration. The bottom line is that those who believe in the climate change fight must keep putting the effort in, Solberg continues. People who continue to deny will fall back, and lose out in the future. And we shouldn\u2019t forget that America has never been in the front line of the fight against climate change. As Friedman wryly points out, it\u2019s a little worrying that there are Neo-nazi parties in Europe who believe in climate change, while one of America\u2019s two major political parties doesn\u2019t. Former US vice-president Al Gore is speaking about climate change now, saying there are only three questions remaining on the climate crisis: Must we change? Can we change? Will we change? Gore than takes a swipe at Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying: On the first question, must we change, most people in the world are now convinced; but we are reminded by some recent elections and appointments that not everyone is there. It\u2019s just been confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year in recorded history, Gore continues, for the third year running. And he adds that the public are seeing the consequences: Every night on the television news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelations. People are connecting the dots and coming to the realisation that the answer to that first question is yes. On \u2018can we change?\u2019, Gore says the cost of renewable energy is coming down as dramatically as computer chips. And on \u2018will we change?\u2019, Gore says the Paris Agreement is \u201cthe most inspiring and greatest accomplishment since the whole negotiating process began\u201d. It has sent a signal to business, individuals, civil society - that signal has been received and had a dramatic change. The link between the pound and the FTSE 100 continues to hold. A dip in sterling - partly on profit taking after Tuesday\u2019s gains in the wake of UK prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech - has given a lift to the leading index. The FTSE 100 - which is full of overseas earners who benefit when the pound is weaker - closed up 27.23 points or 0.38% at 7247.61. The pound is currently down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2304 and 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1521. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Trading on the FTSE was muted the day after suffering its biggest loss in six months. The British pound, drifting lower in a correction of its biggest daily gain since 2008, helped the UK equity benchmark to modest gains. We view the move in the British pound following Prime Minister\u2019s speech as a game-changer and as such don\u2019t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100. UK multinationals, like Burberry, still stand to benefit from a weak pound. The shift in sentiment in the pound means that gains could now be more concentrated in specific companies and industries, rather than the entire UK stock market. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.51% to 11,599.39 while France\u2019s Cac has closed 0.13% higher at 4853.40. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 20 points or 0.1% lower. Just 21% of delegates at WEF this year are female, despite years of pressure (companies can send an extra delegate as long as one member of the party is a woman). IMF chief Christine Lagarde has highlighted the scale of the problem. We just ran into Liam Fox, the UK\u2019s secretary of state for international trade, as he arrived at WEF. Fox says he\u2019s at Davos make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. He\u2019s also here to support Theresa May, who gives a special address to Davos on Thursday morning. Sitting alongside Pierre Moscovici, economist Joseph Stiglitz says that if Europe can\u2019t build the institutions to make the euro work it should admit that it has failed. Unless there is such a mechanism, he says, Europe should \u201cface reality, say this has been an interesting experiment but currencies come and go.\u201d Stiglitz says Europe should not give up on integration, but should simply go about it in a different way. The euro, he says, has \u201cundermined solidarity\u201d. The answer to Europe\u2019s problems is to have more Europe, not less, Moscovici adds (isn\u2019t it always?!). \u201cWe need more convergence, more policy tools, a budget and a minster of finance for the EU. We must invest more.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for the economy, is speaking at a session on The European Disunion. He admits that people are not happy. \u201cPeople suffer from too weak growth, too high unemployment and too much debt. There\u2019s economic anger and cultural anger.\u201d But he insists that the \u201cEU is solid and a unique model\u201d. The three things Europe needs are economic efficiency, to protect its citizens, and to be more democratic and accountability. Guy Standing, professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)  has been telling Davos that the time has come for a universal income for all citizens. Standing says he has been making the case for a basic income to be paid to everyone regardless of whether they are rich or poor for many years but the idea has recently started to get attention because of the fears of job losses from automation. \u201cA basic income is not a panacea but it is part of the new redistribution we should be building for the 21st Century.\u201d Standing says there are three arguments for a basic income: social justice, freeing people from those wielding arbitrary power, and the provision of basic security.He says a basic income is easily affordable and could be paid for by taking the proceeds of \u201crentier capitalism. \u201cThe returns to property and intellectual property and natural resources are going to a minority and we must do something about that.\u201d Standing bemoans the fact that Britain did not use its oil revenues during the North Sea boom to set up a sovereign wealth fund. \u201cHad Britain set up a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, it could be paying out more than a basic income\u201d, he said. In one of those \u2018only at Davos\u2019 moments, 17 Pok\u00e9mon Go \u201cPok\u00e9stops\u201d have been set up around the ski resort to (possibly) raise awareness of inequality. It\u2019s the brainchild of film director Richard Curtis\u2019s development agency, called Project Everyone. Stops include worthy causes like \u201cZero Hunger\u201d and \u201cGood Health.\u201d According to Business Insider, Olympic medal-winning sprinter Michael Johnson and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver have been spotted playing the game. Curtis is hoping that others follow suit, saying: \u201cI\u2019m hoping a surprising number might think it is quite an amusing thing to do. I\u2019ve noticed the Davos audience are quite willing to laugh at even quite weak jokes, because they\u2019re looking for entertainment!\u201d Just be careful on those icy pavements... Away from Davos for a moment once more, and US consumer prices rose in December, up 2.1% year on year mainly due to higher fuel prices as crude recovered more ground from its recent lows. That was the biggest year on year gain since the middle of 2014 and rose from a figure of 1.7% in November, although it was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. The month on month figure showed a rise of 0.3% in the consumer price index, compared to 0.2% in November. With price pressures increasing - especially if Donald Trump follows through with his promises to boost spending - the chances of a US rate hike are also rising. When the Federal Reserve increased rates in December, it predicted three more rises this year. James Knightley, senior economist at ING Bank, said: Both headline and core inflation are rising faster than 2% year on year, helping to build the case for further Fed rate hikes. US consumer price inflation came in exactly in line for December with the headline rate rising 0.3% month on month leading to an annual inflation rate of 2.1% versus 1.7% in November. The core (ex food and energy) rose 0.2% month on month leaving the annual rate at 2.2% versus 2.1% previously. This is the first time that both headline and core US inflation is rising at 2% or more since the second quarter of 2014. Fuel prices were the main culprit with energy prices rising 1.5% month on month and transportation costs increasing 1% month on month. Most other components rose 0.2% or 0.3% but there was some softness in food (flat on the month) and apparel (-0.7% month on month). With headline inflation likely to move up towards 2.5% in the second half of the year and President Trump promising pro-growth and pro-job policies in what already is a fairly strong story, it means further Federal Reserve rate hikes are not far away. We expect the next one in March with a further move higher in the third quarter of 2017. Europe needs to spend more on defence to protect the Transatlantic Alliance, says Germany\u2019s defence minister. Ursula von der Leyen told a panel that: Europe has to take a fair share of the burden. It\u2019s not at that point that now, so we have to invest more in defence. We want a strong European pillar within Nato, she continues, and the ability to tackle more problems in Africa. Nato\u2019s future bas been cast into doubt by Donald Trump; von der Leyen see a bright future, though. I\u2019m very confident that this wonderful and precious friendship will last long. Von der Leyen says the Alliance between the US and Europe goes beyond military issues; it is based on a long period of friendship and trust, and shared values: We are fighting for something \u2014 for democracy, for the open society, the rule of law. Frederick Pempe, CEO of The Atlantic Council, agrees, saying that he\u2019s caution against seeing the \u2018death knell\u2019 of the Transatlantic Alliance. Currently, the US spends $600bn per year on military spending, while European countries spend $300bn. Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg is also on this panel about \u2018positive narratives\u2019. She explains how it\u2019s important that people have a \u2018common understanding\u2019 of the past, to help create a shared identity. That\u2019s not helped, of course, by the flood of fake news and online misinformation we\u2019ve seen recently on places like, well, Facebook..... If you look at the history of mankind, you see that societal change and progress is a messy thing, Meg Whitman continues. Her message to leaders at Davos is to \u201cbe the change you want to create\u201d. Sometimes these problems are so overwhelming that if you carve out something that matters to you, that you can make a big difference to, that can push the ball down the field. Technology has pulled 100s of millions of people out of poverty, it has connected a lot of people, it has modernised agriculture and medicine. But it\u2019s also creating economic dislocation, the HP boss continues. It\u2019s up to leaders in this room, particularly in the technology field, to think \u2018how do we help manage the transition of people who have been disrupted by robotics or automation\u2019 -- which by the way is a far bigger cause of job losses in the US than economic globalisation. That includes retraining workforces, pooling hiring across companies, to create opportunities for people where they are. Despite the gloom in the global economy, is there a \u2018positive narrative\u2019 out there? On a panel session in the main hall (livefeed here), documentary maker Sharmeen Obaid- Chinoy says technology is giving people more control. People want to take ownership of their stories, especially young people. There are a lot of anxieties. Violence against women in many parts of the world has gone up, but so has access to technology and women are now more aware of their rights. Young people are now beginning to break free. Their anxieties focus on if they\u2019ll have the same opportunities as their grandparents. Will they be told what do by the leaders in their countries, or will they break through? I see less anxiety in the places I work, and more hope. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, says that there needs to be a better discussion about the impact that technology has on jobs. Meg Whitman of HP is blunter, saying that \u201csome of the chickens have come home to roost\u201d. That includes: Declining trust in institutions Economic dislocation leading to the refugee crisis Economic dislocation caused by technology. And technology will only have a bigger impact, she warns, as AI, robotics and 3D printing all develop. So \u201cwe need to create a new narrative\u201d, Whitman adds, based on the right thing for the economy, and giving more hope to people who have been dislocated by technology. Here\u2019s a video clip of Joe Biden telling the global elite at Davos to pull their weight. Mike Gregoire, the chief executive of software giant CA Technologies, has criticised the idea that simply taxing the 1% richest more will solve our economic problems. Speaking to me at Davos, he says the key is to invest more in science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, to help people in the new economy (a theme Joe Biden touched on in his speech too). Gregoire says: The lack of both business and governments, and I say both, focusing on retraining people in STEM education for the jobs of the future, rather than trying to protect a job of the past, needs a lot more work. The notion of this 1% - it\u2019s a very convenient argument. The math doesn\u2019t work. If you want to talk about taxpayers - I\u2019m a 60% taxpayer, and my company is a 30% taxpayer. If you charge every company and every person, you can\u2019t tax them enough that it would make a difference if you haven\u2019t attacked the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that the economy is changing, and the value curve is changing, and the skill sets are changing, and that\u2019s what we should focus our attention on. Gregoire adds that modern manufacturing is much cleaner than in the past, has fewer people and it\u2019s highly automated - and that automation will increase. So what are you doing to prepare people for that economy, rather than the economy of the past? CA supports several organisations that promote STEM skills, including Tech Girls Rock. Gregoire is also a board member of Npower, which helps minorities develop the skills to get a tech job. Gregoire explains why this is important: We\u2019re talking about a whole generation of folks who could add value to our economy, and they just don\u2019t have the skills because they haven\u2019t been trained to be able to participate. That\u2019s something we can all help lean into. Here\u2019s foreign policy expert David Rothkopf on Biden\u2019s farewell speech. While Joe Biden was criticising Russia, his predecessor Al Gore was speaking at the Davos Arctic Camp - set up by climate scientists to focus attention on global warning. We should hear more from Gore later today (he\u2019s on a climate panel at 6pm Davos time) Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s top-level panel on the middle class crisis. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has called for urgent action to tackle a middle-class crisis as she warned that inequality, distrust and a lack of hope were fuelling growing political populism. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Lagarde said she had first highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been ignored. \u201cI hope people will listen now,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.6 billion people. \u201cWith lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s the full story: Away from Davos briefly and some more reaction to the UK jobs numbers. Some analysts, while acknowleding the latest figures are generally positive, wonder if the momentum can continue. Nina Skero, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now stands at 74.5%. The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher than in December 2015. With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending by reducing head counts. On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by inflation. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said: The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015. Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data yesterday, this development won\u2019t ease the MPC\u2019s concerns about the anticipated period of above-target CPI. In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 31.9/wk... As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is that the headwinds we have identified don\u2019t materialise as quickly as expected at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining impressive at the end of 2016. That is likely to lead the Bank of England to revise up its GDP forecast at the February Inflation Report but the scale of any such optimistic revisions should be tempered given the context of less encouraging news on the quantity of labour being used in the economy. London mayor Sadiq Khan is in Davos today, as part of his push to protect the capital, and its financial centre, from harm from Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He\u2019s holding various meeting, and will also address business leaders tonight at a Morgan Stanley dinner. According to his office, he will say: \u201cSecuring privileged access to the single market must be the top priority for the negotiations. It\u2019s critical for London. Nothing else will do. It can\u2019t be brushed aside \u2013 as it was yesterday. \u201cA hard-line approach to Brexit \u2026\u2026. could rip Britain apart. \u201cAnd if we continue on this path - towards a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 \u2013 we risk having to explain to future generations why we knowingly put their economy, their prosperity and their place on the world stage in such peril.\u201d Biden left the stage to a rousing standing ovation - but I suspect it won\u2019t be last time we see him at Davos: The FT\u2019s Katie Martin has a good take on Joe Biden\u2019s sting criticism of Russia, in his final speech as vice-president. US vice president Joe Biden has pointed the finger of blame specifically at Russia for seeking to \u201cwhittle away at the edges of the European project.\u201d The country, he said, is \u201ctesting the fault lines between western nations.\u201d Mr Biden described himself as a committed supporter of globalisation, while issuing a plea to defend the \u201cliberal international order\u201d and the close ties between the US and Europe that he describes as key to securing prosperity and security. \u201cImpulses to hunker down, to build walls, are precisely the wrong answer,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s the full story: Biden ends his final speech as US vice-president with a rousing call for Europe and the US to \u201clead the fight\u201d to defend the values that created today\u2019s world. That means: A fight for democracy, a fight to reject isolationism and protectionism\u201d. Quite a way to bow out of office. Biden then turns to geopolitics, and singles out Russia. Under president Putin, Russia has been testing the fault lines in other nations, says Biden. It is trying to return to a world of \u2018spheres of influences\u2019, even sending \u2018little green men\u2019 across borders to stir up separatism in Ukraine. And he insists that Nato\u2019s \u2018sacred\u2019 commitment to defend each other from attacks can never be questioned (a nudge towards Donald Trump, who has suggested the alliance is obsolete) Looking into his audience of global leaders in Davos, Biden says a \u201cprogressive tax system\u201d where everyone pays a fair share will help address the crisis. And he appeals to their better nature, saying: I told a group of you last night - the top 1%\u2019s not carrying their weight You\u2019re not bad guys, you\u2019re good guys. If you speak to the public and ask if they\u2019d rather have free college education, or a raise - they\u2019d take the free college education, Biden continues. Biden also says that people also need \u201ccontinuing education\u201d through their lives to help them adjust to technology change, and we must ensure basic protections for workers. Millions of people around the world have benefitted from globalisation and new technology, Biden continues. But in other places, factories are closing and jobs are being lost. Taken together, these forces are effectively hollowing out the middle-class, the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in Western nations. We cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor should we try. But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people\u2019s basic sense of dignity. Biden is speaking about how the liberal world order pioneered by the US and Europe after world war 2 delivered unprecedented growth and security; but it is now at threat. He explains how his father had explained that a job was about more than just a pay cheque; it was also about self respect and worth. And he talks about how workers are losing out: In my country, there used to be a basic bargain since the mid-20th century, agreed by both parties.... If you contributed to the success of the enterprise that you were engaged, you got to share the success and the profits. Biden begins by telling that there is \u201cpalpable uncertainty about the state of the world.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t mean the transfer of power in America this week. In two days there will be a new president of the United States...  calls out one delegate. No, Biden replies. The challenges we face, and the choices we must make as an international community doesn\u2019t hinge exclusively on Washington\u2019s leadership. Whether we reinforce the ties that bind us or whether we unravel under the current pressure. These choices must be made by very single nation. Davos delegates have flooding into the main hall here to watch the set-piece event of the morning, vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s final speech in office. Biden gets a warm, standing ovation as he arrives on stage. And he gets a second round of applause as he introduces himself as \u201cvice-president for the next 48 hours, and after that I\u2019ll be able to say what I really think\u201d. You can watch it live here: The number of people in work in the UK dipped slightly in the three months to November compared to the previous quarter, but average weekly earnings came in higher than expected and the claimant count for December fell by more than forecast. The jobless rate for the three months held at an 11 year low of 4.8%, in line with forecasts, and unemployment fell from 1.65m to 1.6m. But the number of people in work fell by 9,000 to just over 31.8m. This is the second report in a row to show a dip in the number of people in work, perhaps suggesting a slight degree of reluctance among employers in the wake of the Brexit vote. Average weekly earnings including bonuses rose from 2.6% to 2.8% compared to expectations of a figure of 2.6%. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 10,100 in December after rising by 1,300 in the previous month. Analysts had expected a rise of 5,000 in the claimant figures. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets UK, said: We had another set of promising economic data today which has shown that average earnings have increased and unemployment claims have fallen. It was important that the average earning index picks up pace to keep up with inflation. The inflation data released earlier has already brought headache for the MPC members and it is not a good news for consumers because their purchase power is going to see a dramatic impact. Households will have to dig deeper in their pockets and if their earnings do not match inflation, we have a problem. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: Overall, with employment levels still close to record levels and unemployment continuing to fall, the latest indicators confirm that the UK jobs market remains a major bright spot for the UK economy. While labour market conditions could soften over the next year as economic growth slows, the high degree of flexibility in the jobs market will help limit the extent of any uptick in unemployment. Although there was a welcome pick-up in average earnings growth, the gap between wage and price growth is narrowing. If this continues as we expect, real household incomes will be squeezed further, stifling consumer spending, which is a key driver of UK economic growth. Elsewhere in Davos, delegates have been discussing the gender divide, and how fighting stereotypes can fix it: Do any of the global elite do their own laundry, I wonder... Another takeaway from that session: Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan concludes the session on the middle class crisis with a three-point plan. 1) We need to take populists seriously, he argues, and not just paint them as the bad guys. Often they are the good guys, with genuine concerns about the future. 2) There is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d or short cut to fixing the economic problems fuelling populism. The solutions are complicated 3) Policymakers must deliver a vision of a better future; something that is lacking in Europe right now. Lagarde insists there is still time for \u201ccourageous\u201d politicians to reconnect with the people. They must create policies that address concerns such, as what future their children face and what safety net will be in place. There is hope, and I don\u2019t think we should be resigned to taking the situation as it is. Lagarde argues that globalisation needs to take \u201ca new turn\u201d, and we need more analytical work how jobs are being lost to new technologies. She says: To turn our back to globalisation, to helping development, is entirely the wrong approach. She also cites Oxfam\u2019s warning that the 8th richest people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the population. More from Larry Summers: Hedge fund chief Ray Dalio warns that the age of globalisation may be over, as provincialism and nationalism rise. Larry Summers, though, points out that Dalio won\u2019t suffer -- he\u2019ll manage to position himself in the markets whatever happens. The people who will be the victims of populist policies are the lower income and middle class people in whose name the policy is offered. Italy\u2019s finance minister points out that many Europeans blame the leaders in Brussels, or the central bankers in Frankfurt, for the situation today. Larry Summers, though, disputes whether concerns over income inequality really explain the crisis in the middle classes. The US has just elected the world\u2019s biggest example of conspicuous consumption, he says That is a bizarre manifestation of a concern over inequality. Many people think \u201ctoo much is being done for the poor, rather than that too little is being done for the poor\u201d. Summers argues that the surge in support for populism is due to issues like \u201cnational unity and strength\u201d, not just envy over wealth. Lagarde reveals that she felt a backlash from economists, including in the IMF, after she warned about rising inequality in 2013. Policymakers need to get the signal now, and really think about how to address the public discontent. That means fiscal and structural reforms, and effective monetary policies, but it also includes redistributing wealth better, the IMF chief says: It needs to be granular, it needs to be regional, it needs to be focused on what will people get out of it. It probably includes more redistibution than we have in place at the moment. Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio says populism is now the biggest issue in the global economy, overtaking central banks. Harvard professor Larry Summers says that populism is on the rise because many people in the middle classes of advanced economies feel their governments aren\u2019t fighting for them. They feel the governments are fighting for people in developing countries, for people who have recently come into their countries, for minority groups who used to suffer discrimination, but not the people \u201cin the centre of the country\u201d. They feel they are not being heard, and they\u2019ve expressed that in the Brexit vote, the Italian referendum and in the US election. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan agrees with Christine Lagarde that the middle classes are in crisis. It is hard to find a country where there isn\u2019t dissatisfaction with the situation today, says Padoan. He cites changes in wealth and income distribution - and about people\u2019s expectations. The middle class is disillusion about the future, disappointed about the figure of their children, and unhappy about the benefits they\u2019re receiving from the state. The session gets under way - here\u2019s a live feed: Christine Lagarde speaks first, and agrees that the middle classes in advanced economies are now in crisis. The middle class is both growing and shrinking, she points out.. Globally, it\u2019s grown from 7% of the global population to 13%. But in America, it\u2019s shrunk from 60-ish% to 50-ish% -- with more money accumulating at the top. That is combined with signs of lack of trust, lack of hope, disenchantment with the vision of the future. With lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies. Speaking of things that make people angry... Here\u2019s the pitch for the first big session of the morning: Squeezed and Angry: How to Fix the Middle-Class Crisis The middle class is squeezed and aggrieved. Once the lynchpin of developed economies, it\u2019s now threatened by job losses and stagnant wages, paving the way for the rise of populism. In emerging markets, middle class growth rates are stalling. Have middle class problems been forgotten? What can be done? IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Founder, Chairman and Co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, discuss what\u2019s needed to restore growth in the middle class and confidence in the future. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Today, some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people will be discussing why the rest of the population are increasingly angry and disillusioned with the state of the world. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will ponder how to fix the middle class crisis, alongside Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Harvard professor Larry Summers. Plus, (this is Davos after all) a billionaire! Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, will also chip in. Hopefully we\u2019ll get some decent ideas on how to boost employment prospects and income growth. After yesterday\u2019s focus on globalisation, potential trade wars and president Trump, today will also focus on climate change. A group of scientists has set up an Arctic base camp in Davos, to highlight the dangers of climate change and the warming ice caps. And we salute them for sleeping out in tents last night -- when it was minus 16 degrees C. Europe is also on the agenda, with panel sessions on Brexit, the European Union, and the Transatlantic Alliance. There\u2019s also going to be a scrum to see Joe Biden address delegates, on his final overseas trip as vice-president. Here\u2019s some of the key events today: 9am Davos time/8am GMT: Panel: How to fix the middle-class crisis 10am/9am GMT: Arctic basecamp press conference 10.30am/9.30am GMT: Special address by Joe Biden 1.45pm/12.45pm GMT: Is the Transatlantic Alliance at a tipping point? 2.45pm/1.45pm Fixing European disunion 5pm/4pm GMT: How to accelerate the fight against climate change, with Al Gore",

After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019.</p> <p>This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter...</p> <p>In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning.</p> <p>Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44</li> <li>Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89</li> <li>France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14</li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%.</p> <p>As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:17:23.303Z\">at 5.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f2c0e4b01065cf59861d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:15:30.626Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV.</p> <p><em>On bank jobs leaving London:</em></p> <p>Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that.</p> <p><em>On the customs union:</em></p> <p>Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK.</p> <p><em>On globalisation:</em></p> <p> I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone.</p> <p><em>On the pound\u2019s weakness:</em></p> <p>Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p><em>And on technology and jobs:</em></p> <p>Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. <br></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-19/may-tells-banks-she-values-them-as-they-pack-their-brexit-bags\">Bloomberg\u2019s write-up</a> of the interview.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:20:15.585Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f01ee4b00b8fc2ae2666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:59:15.534Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes people feel globalization has &quot;left them behind,&quot; Theresa May says <a href=\"https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN\">https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5NaC9Y37cx\">pic.twitter.com/5NaC9Y37cx</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880ece5e4b0f0efb00f5cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nickfletcher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:54:45.388Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve had &quot;positive discussions&quot; with big banks about jobs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal\">@bbckamal</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/davos2017?src=hash\">#davos2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd\">https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FUjE1fEKMs\">pic.twitter.com/FUjE1fEKMs</a></p>&mdash; BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p>Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy.</p> <p>She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/822122563610480642\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of what UK PM May said in that BTV interview has already been discounted...

Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong.

                "bodyText":"Here are some of the key quotes from George Soros, for those who missed his interview here in Davos tonight (delegates are now polishing off the pudding and wine in the Seehof Hotel) In my opinion is is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament.And I think she will not last. At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted, and they live in hope.But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they\u2019ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won\u2019t rise as fast as the cost of living. The divorce is going to take a very long time. Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning. Hmmmm, maybe George. And on Europe, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday said: \u201cOne has to recognize that the European Union has become too complicated and people are alienated. The anti-European parties are gathering force.\u201d And that\u2019s all from Davos. Goodnight!! GW Soros also took a swipe at Hungary\u2019s government, which is threatening to crack down on the non-government agencies he funds. He reads out a statement, saying that these threats against civil society are an affront to European values. Before anyone mistakes George Soros for Cassandra, lets remember that he predicted a year ago that Europe would disintegrate. He now says it won\u2019t - because neither Vladimir Putin nor China want it to fail. This session is being streamed live on Bloomberg TV, for anyone who hasn\u2019t made it to the Seehof hotel in Davos. Soros is taking questions from the room now -- and accepting them by email too, at sorosdavos2017@gmail.com Onto China....and Soros says Beijing would have no choice but to retaliate if Donald Trump labelled it a currency manipulator. It\u2019s much harder to get divorced than to get married, Soros continues, explaining why the Brexit process will take a long time. And he even suggests that Britain could quit the EU on a Friday, and rejoin on the Monday (!) George Soros now declares that it is unlikely that prime minister Theresa May will remain in power for long. She has already got a divided cabinet and a small majority in parliament....I think she will not last, Soros tells his audience of Davos delegates. The people in the UK are in denial, Soros continues. The current economic situation is not as bad as expected, so they live in hope, but as the currency depreciates, inflation will lead to a decline in living standards. It will take time, but when it happens they will realise they are not as well off as before, Soros concludes. If Europe breaks down, the consequences will be very dire, Soros concludes. And currently it is going in the wrong direction. Q: How will Brexit play out? I hope that both sides realise they must find some common ground. A bitter divorce would hurt both sides - And the divorce will be a long process. But when people realise they are going in the wrong direction, they will come together. Soros cites the Guardian\u2019s recent story that Michel Barnier was pushing for a special deal for the City. Last year was a disaster for Europe, Soros continues, with the Brexit vote and the Italian election. Europe has become too complicated, and people are alienated - the anti-European parties are gathering force and the future looks very bleak Hello again from the Seehof hotel in Davos, where veteran billionaire investor/philantropist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. On Donald Trump, Soros says he has described Trump as an imposter, a conman and a would-be dictator. But he is confident that the constitution of the US and division of power will hold sway. He would be a dictator if he could get away with it..but he won\u2019t. When Trump oversteps the mark, they will fight back, Soros predicts. He believes that Trump was surprised to win the November election.....he was engaged in building his brand and his success in attracting crowds. Soros says he\u2019s convinced that Trump will fail - not because people want him to, but because the ideas that drive him are essentially contradictory. For example, he has three chiefs of staff instead of one, and there will be tensions within his cabinet - meaning a lot of infighting in future. And that means that the markets won\u2019t maintain recent gains, Soros predicts: Right now, uncertainty is at its peak, and uncertainty is the enemy of long-term investment. It\u2019s all winding down in the WEF conference centre now; but we\u2019ll hoping to cover an interview/dinner with George Soros at around 8.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT) Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish comments at the latest European Central Bank meeting sent the euro lower and also helped push European markets marginally into the red. And with the dollar also weaker against the pound, the FTSE 100 also fell back - unsurprising given much of its recent gains have been due to the weakness of sterling boosting overseas earners. After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019. This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter... In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning. Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%. As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590. Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV. On bank jobs leaving London: Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that. On the customs union: Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK. On globalisation: I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone. On the pound\u2019s weakness: Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom. And on technology and jobs: Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. And here is Bloomberg\u2019s write-up of the interview. Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace. Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future. This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy. She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reckons that European leaders won\u2019t be scared by Philip Hammond\u2019s threat to slash taxes and regulation if Britain doesn\u2019t get a good Brexit deal. May and Hammond had two aims in Davos. The first was to convince UK business leaders they had a plan, an objective largely achieved even among those that think tough times lie ahead. The second was to smooth things over with businesses and politicians in the rest of Europe, which has been far less successful. May and Hammond seem oblivious to the current level of hostility towards the UK. Nor is the May-Hammond \u201ciron fist in the velvet glove\u201d routine likely to make the rest of Europe soften its hard line in the negotiations. Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong. The EU 27 will see scorched earth as an empty threat. Which it is. Here\u2019s his full analysis: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the new head of the United Nations, has singled out youth unemployment as a major threat to global security. In a keynote speech, Guterres says that: The scourge of youth unemployment is probably the worst problem we are facing today, with consequences for the wellbeing of the people involved, societies, and global security too. Young unemployment people in several parts of the world are the largest area of recruitment for terrorist groups. Guterres also warns that we live in a \u201cdangerous world\u201d today; countries must bolster their efforts to deliver peace. The euro has weakened on Mario Draghi\u2019s comments at the ECB\u2019s first press conference of 2017, with investors interpreting his stance as largely dovish. After announcing its decision to leave key interest rates and the quantitative easing (QE) programme unchanged at its 1,000th board meeting, the ECB president highlighted downside risks to the eurozone economy from \u201cglobal uncertainty\u201d and noted a lack of underlying upward pressure on inflation. Much of the recent rise in inflation, he says, is down to energy price movements and he also pointed out nominal wages growth remains subdued. There is more of that in his opening statement. Draghi appeared keen to send the message that the ECB remains ready to do more to shore up the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery as necessary. Draghi said there was no discussion of tapering - the process of winding down QE. In the wake of criticism from German politicians over how low interest rates were hurting those with savings, he also called on people to be patient with the ECB. He patiently fielded several questions on German low rate angst. To the likely disappointment of reporters at the news conference, the ECB president dodged a question on whether Donald Trump could make life more difficult for those charged with safeguarding the euro after the president elect said in an interview that it would be a struggle keeping the euro together. A careful Draghi said: I just won\u2019t make any comment on that... I would rather comment on policies and policy actions than just statements.\u201d His apparently relaxed stance on inflation left the euro down 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.0600 by the end of the news conference. Against the pound it is down 0.6% on the day to 86.19 pence. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 share index turned positive after the apparent promise of ultra-low interest rates for a very long time to come. Commenting on the tone of the press conference, David Lamb sums up the likely reaction of German politicians: In Berlin, Mario Draghi\u2019s unwavering dovishness will go down about as well as Donald Trump\u2019s hints of tariffs on German cars... With the money-printing set to continue until further notice, inflationary pressures will return and the euro has taken an immediate hit. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima says the\u201drace to the bottom on corporate tax\u201d needs to be addressed. It\u2019s worrying now. We\u2019ve seen the promise from president-elect Trump to cut corporate tax. We\u2019ve heard Theresa May threatening to make Britain a little island with low tax rates on the shores of Europe. These are steps in the wrong direction. This year we need to see progress on this corporate tax competition. This isn\u2019t just an issue of legal compliance, Byanyima continues. The local corner shop where I buy bread probably pays a higher tax rate than Apple. We want to see big companies take this as more than a legal compliance, and see it as a moral issue to society - to provide their fair share to fund heath, education, to create jobs for young people, she adds. Switzerland is now \u2018fighting the good fight\u2019 against tax avoidance today, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. Some background: the new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) come into effect in September 2017, when around 50 jurisdictions will work towards having their first information exchanges. Angel Gurria insists that real progress has been made in fighting tax avoidance and evasion. Back in 2008, there were 30 agreements to share tax information. Today there are 3,500, he says. The promise is enormous, and the potential is very great and it could really help these developing countries. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima is adamant that the current plans don\u2019t go far enough. Simply hiring more tax collectors doesn\u2019t address the use of tax loopholes, or the wider issue of low corporate tax rates. The transparency is good, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough. It doesn\u2019t have public country-by-country recording -- if people don\u2019t know what firms are doing, you\u2019re not going to get the secrecy out and tax them fairly. Panama\u2019s vice-president points the finger at big companies for forcing tax breaks out of developing countries. Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado says some multinationals go to 3rd World companies and \u201cinsist on negotiating tax breaks that local companies don\u2019t have\u201d, in return for siting their operations there. Poland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, reckons the global tax avoidance problem is probably even bigger than that $240bn figure. Morawiecki says that the three countries who make the most foreign direct investment into the European Union are the United States, then Switzerland, then Bermuda. And the list of FDI payments to countries from the EU is exactly the same (ie, the most goes to the US, then Switzerland then Bermuda). If this is not huge, global tax evasion, I don\u2019t know what is. Tax avoidance is a human rights issue, declares Winnie Byanyima, executive director at Oxfam International. She tells her audience at WEF that Kenya is losing $1.1bn every year through tax incentives and tax exceptions. That\u2019s almost double its health budget; in a country where 1 in 40 children die at childbirth. This is really a human rights issue. Byanyima is much less optimist than the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria - she agrees there is progress, but we have a long way to go. She brings a home truth to Davos too: First of all, the developing countries are not at the table, while a notorious tax haven like Switzerland had a place at the table. There is a harmful race to the bottom with countries offering lower tax rates to attract companies (something Philip Hammond has been hinting at), Byanyima adds, saying pointedly: If you can\u2019t dodge taxes, you pay the government to lower the tax rate. Companies need to be forced to provide proper country-by-country reporting of their tax bills, she concludes, to get proper transparency: Yes we are moving, but not fast enough or broadly enough. Panama\u2019s vice-president says her government understands the importance of taxes, both to fund Panama\u2019s spending and to help other countries fight evasion. According to Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, Panama had been taking action since her government took office 2 and a half-years ago. Before the Panama Papers, President Varela had announced our commitment to automatic information sharing, to the United Nations. And then this leak came, which pointed out a global problem... A global problem which Panama needs to participate in the solution, and the rest of the world needs to participate in the solution. It made us run faster, we were already running. I can say today there is not one issue pending in Panama\u2019s steps to comply with international standards on information sharing, she adds. The panel begins by hearing that countries lose $240bn of tax revenues per year through tax avoidance by companies, according to the OECD 100 countries have signed to an information-sharing deal. Is it making a difference? Absolutely, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. And that includes Panama, which has signed up too. My message to the Panamanian Congress is - yes, pass the law. Complying with the tax system doesn\u2019t mean changing it, it means enforcing it, Gurria continues. And next September, countries will start automatic information sharing - companies who haven\u2019t reported information correctly will be caught out. Nine months ago the Guardian exposed how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca was helping some of the world\u2019s richest people, and its largest companies, avoid tax. Those revelations helped to drive the issue of aggressive tax avoidance high up the political agenda. Now, a heavyweight group at Davos are discussing how to get multinational companies to pay a fair share -- an issue Theresa May also highlighted in her speech. On the panel: Angel Gurr\u00eda: Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Winnie Byanyima: Executive Director, Oxfam International Valdis Dombrovskis: Vice-President and Commissioner, Euro and Socia..., European Commission Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado: Vice-President of Panama Mateusz Morawiecki: Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Here\u2019s some background reading while we wait for it to start: Chancellor Philip Hammond turned a bit lyrical when he spoke to business leaders today, telling them that the \u201cfog of Brexit\u201d was starting to lift. \u201cWe are not going to get rid of it overnight but I hope gradually it will start to lift. A few things are becoming clearer through the mist.\u201d The chancellor also stressed that the Government would do whatever necessary to ensure Britain remained competitive in the event that the rest of the EU cuts up rough in the divorce negotiations for Brexit. Hammond said: If somehow despite out best efforts political retribution were to triumph over economic logic, and we don\u2019t get a fair deal....we will have to do whatever was necessary to ensure the continued competitiveness in those circumstances. \u201cThat\u2019s not a threat. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious.\u201d He returned to the theme in the Q&amp;A session after his speech, saying that a free trade deal with the EU was not the only way for Britain to remain competitive. \u201cWe have reinvented ourselves before and we will do so again if we have to.\u201d Elsewhere in Davos, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has taken another stride onto the world stage by announcing a major sponsorship deal with the Olympics. Ma\u2019s Alibaba has signed up until 2028, and will provide cloud computing services, and help build a new e-commerce platform to flog Olympic branded products to the masses. They\u2019ll also help develop and customise the Olympic Channel, a web site, for a Chinese audience. No pricing details, I\u2019m afraid. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been praising the City, at a lunch with top UK CEOs and journalists. Hammond warns that \u2018fragmenting the City\u2019 isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interests, but he has also repeated his warning that the UK could lower taxes and regulations if it can\u2019t get a good Brexit deal: Hammond also touches on the customs union issue that is worrying Sir Angus Deaton: Away from Davos, the European Central Bank has confirmed it is leaving its key interest rates unchanged and not tinkering any more for now with its bond-buying programme, AKA quantitative easing (QE). Amid signs that inflation and growth are picking up, the Frankfurt-based central bank for the eurozone also stuck to its previous guidance that it stood ready to act should things take a turn for the worse. The full statement is here, but here\u2019s a flavour: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases... If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the [asset purchase] programme in terms of size and/or duration.\u201d We will get a clearer sense of how ECB policymakers see things when president Mario Draghi hosts a news conference at 13.30GMT. The ECB surprised markets in December by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u20ac60bn (\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u20ac80bn currently. But whatever you do, don\u2019t try and tell Mario Draghi that\u2019s tapering. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who isn\u2019t at Davos, alas) has responded to May\u2019s speech: \u201cToday in Davos the Prime Minister talked about making globalisation work for all. But actions speak louder than words. \u201cAt every opportunity, the Conservatives have given handouts to the wealthiest and cut taxes for big business - while refusing to provide vital funds for the NHS, cutting social care and ditching rights at work. \u201cTheresa May\u2019s vision for Brexit is now clear: a bargain basement Britain on the shores of Europe based on low pay and deregulation. \u201cThis week we heard the Prime Minister threaten to turn Britain into a tax haven, slashing corporate taxes and workers\u2019 rights in an all-out race to the bottom. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be taken in by warm words. This Conservative Government is backed to the hilt by wealthy elites, lines the pockets of its friends and resists all practical steps to make a fairer Britain work for all\u201d. Nobel prize winner Sir Angus Deaton tells me that May\u2019s speech missed out some key issues. For starters, there was no mention of Scotland - Deaton\u2019s home country. He wants to be a member of the European Union, and a member of the United Kingdom - and now that doesn\u2019t seem possible. And on trade, Deaton says: I was also surprised she talked about free trade all the time, and she didn\u2019t talk about the customs union. That\u2019s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain. So I haven\u2019t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out. This was the first time that Deaton has watched May speak in the flesh, and he was reminded of an earlier Conservative leader. The immediate analogy when you see her for the first time is, this looks like Mrs Thatcher. But when you listen to her, she\u2019s sort of the anti-Thatcher in some sense. Mrs Thatcher used to say there is no society, while she was talking about society. Mrs Thatcher would have not been very keen on taking us out of the EU. So it really is very different from Mrs Thatcher. Theresa May\u2019s stern rebuke to businesses who are not paying a fair share of tax sounded good in the cavernous WEF hall. However, we should remember that Britain has been lowering its own corporation tax rate for years to attract firms to base here. And just last week, chancellor Philip Hammond threatened that the UK might abandon European-style regulations and taxes after Brexit, if the economy struggles. The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Liberal Democrat party, Tim Farron, says: \u201cThe Prime Minister certainly has a brass neck. She goes to Davos to lecture businesses about looking after the little guy yet she threatens to turn the UK into a Europe\u2019s biggest tax haven. \u201cThis shows, yet again, that this Tory government are treating our country like UK plc. They are running our economy like it is a closing down sale. But higher prices and more expensive fuel mean families will feel the brunt of this government\u2019s bad economic policies.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s speech may have been a hot ticket at Davos and generally well received by those present, but the market reaction back home was far more muted than the wild gyrations seen during Tuesday\u2019s Brexit performance. For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy. The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day. Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u20ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u2019s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail. London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Theresa May is in Davos today. But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City. On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe. I think the fact she\u2019s got a plan is welcome. I think the fact she\u2019s here is brilliant But I think she needs to be listening to what our friends, chief executives, innovators, entrepreneurs, political leaders are saying, which is that no-one is bringing us bad will. There\u2019s no bad feeling here. But there\u2019s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no-one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe. Businesses that leave London aren\u2019t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Frankfurt, they\u2019re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Khan says he fully accepts the referendum result, but argues that \u201cno-one voted to make us poorer\u201d. So the government must make it a priority to get \u201cprivileged access to the single market\u201d so London can still attract talent. The good news is that over the last six months Google, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat have expanded their presence in London. But the bad news is that, as a consequence of the speech on Tuesday we have some banks and investment firms expressing unease about their future. Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has also given May a thumbs-up for her comments on making globalisation work. Speaking to AFP newswires here, she said: It was a good speech. She captured lots of the concerns about a responsible globalisation that we all talk about. Katherine Garrett-Cox, the former chief executive of Alliance Trust, tells me that Theresa May gave Davos what it wanted. I think she did a very good job of setting out a clear plan in terms of what Britain intends to do, what Britain intends to stand for, and I think that\u2019s really what people wanted to hear. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of criticism over the past six months over where does this start and where does it go. I think we heard very clearly that that\u2019s the plan, and now we\u2019ve got to get on and do it. Q: Can we do it, though, at the same time as negotiating Brexit? We\u2019ve all heard that the divorce, as people have called it, is going to be complicated and complex. But I think we all have to believe that we can do it, so I\u2019m optimistic. Q: What\u2019s your biggest concern now with Brexit? My biggest concern is that businesses step up and embrace the opportunity rather than constantly looking for the downside. I\u2019ve grabbed a word with Dr Paul Sheard, the chief global economist of Standard &amp; Poors, outside the conference room. He says May gave a \u201cvery good\u201d speech. Theresa May was laying down a stake and saying - Britain will be the lead supporting voice for globalisation in the world. A lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She\u2019s pivoting to saying \u2018no, this is about Britain being very global\u2019. We now have two global leaders, President Xi Jinping and Theresa May, both making a pitch in support of globalisation, Sheard adds. Two days ago, Chinese president Xi Jinping wowed Davos with a speech defending globalisation, at a time when Donald Trump has put free trade under threat. And now Theresa May has declared that Britain is determined to become a more powerful player after Brexit, despite the difficult negotiations ahead. 1) She seemed to give Davos what it wanted to hear, saying that the UK will be a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d after leaving the EU I want the UK to emerge from this period of change as a truly Global Britain \u2013 the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too; a country that gets out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. 2) She threw her weight behind the growing pressure to fix globalisation to address the populist surge in politics; a major issue this year. May, though, took an almost moral tone, speaking about how the responsibilities we have to one another have been forgotten. This was the key line: But just as we need to act to address the deeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years, so we also need to recognise the way in which a more global and individualistic world can sometimes loosen the ties that bind our society together, leaving some people feeling locked out and left behind. 3) She was interventionist, highlighting her industrial strategy and saying: For government, it means not just stepping back and \u2013 as the prevailing orthodoxy in many countries has argued for so many years \u2013 not just getting out of the way. Not just leaving businesses to get on with the job and assuming that problems will just fix themselves. It means stepping up to a new, active role that backs businesses and ensures more people in all corners of the country share in the benefits of its success. 4) And she criticised business leaders too, especially those multinationals who can seem to play by different rules. Theresa May ended her speech with a call on global leaders and business chiefs to work together to make globalisation work for everyone. As we build a new, bold, confident Global Britain and shape a new era of globalisation that genuinely works for all As we harness the forces of globalisation so that the system works for everyone, and so maintain public support for that system for generations to come. I want that to be the legacy of our time. To use this moment to provide responsive, responsible leadership that will bring the benefits of free trade to every corner of the world; that will lift millions more out of poverty and towards prosperity; and that will deliver security, prosperity and belonging for all of our people. May returns to the downsides of globalisation - and the damage it has done to societies. Too often today, the obligations we have to each other have been forgotten, she says. We need to recognise how a more global and individualistic world can loosen the ties that bind us together. And May stakes her flag firmly, declaring: I am determined that centre-ground mainstream politics can respond to the concerns people have today. That means standing up for free trade and globalisation, but also ensuring it works for everyone. And she quotes Edmund Burke, who wrote: A state without the means for some change is without the means for its own conservation. May insists that governments have an obligation to help those who need help the most. If you\u2019re just getting by, you don\u2019t want a government that gets out of the way - you want one that will help you. Government and business need to do even more to make the case for globalisation, May continues. She cites her new industrial strategy -- a term that had fallen into disrepute in recent years. But Britain is going to create the conditions where winners can grow and thrive, not about \u2018picking winners\u2019. We must step up and take control to make sure that free trade and globalisation works for everyone. May now addresses the UK business leaders in the audience - saying they must do more to help the public. She cites the importance of everyone paying a fair share of tax. In the UK, trust with business runs at just 35% among the lowest-income groups. Companies must putting aside short-term considerations, and investing in people and communities for the long term. There is a feeling that some companies, especially multinationals, are playing by a different set of rules to everyone else, May declares. It is essential for business to show leadership - to show that in this globalised world, everyone is playing by the same rules. On globalisation, May reiterates that some people are being left behind by economic changes - they are getting by but not getting on. On slavery, May urges her audience to help tackle this abhorent problem; she has convened a top-level panel at Davos today to seek solutions. May reminds the audience of the dark days in the first half of the 20th century. We must uphold the institutions that help the world to work together, and guarantee global security. May also cites Britain\u2019s multicultural heritage. May is outlining her vision of making Britain a truly global country. We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again. A country in charge of its own destiny is in a better position to take the lead in improving the world, she continues. She cites the fact that some of Britain\u2019s most famous car brands, like Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by India\u2019s Tata. Brexit was a vote to take control, and make decisions ourselves, May continues. Britain\u2019s history and culture is profoundly international, she says. We have always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We are, by instinct, a great global trading nation. And we want to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world. She welcomes the fact that preliminary talks are underway with several countries including Australia, while China and the Gulf States have expressed interest in making deals with us. Britain faces a time of momentous change, and tough negotiations, May says, following the Brexit vote. But we must believe that it will lead to a better future British people chose to build a truly global country, May says. And we face the future with confidence. May\u2019s on the stage now. This is an organisation that is committed to improving the state of the world. Those of us who meet here are optimists, who believe in the power of public and private collaboration to make the world tomorrow better than today. Free trade, partnership and globalisation. But outside this hall, those forces for good which we take for granted are being called into question. Forces that have had such a positive impact, lifting millions out of poverty, broken down barriers and raised living standards, are now being undermined. As we meet here, across Europe parties of the far left and far right are trying to profit from a keenly felt sense, especially among those on modest incomes, that these forces are not working for them. These people feel that mainstream political and business leaders have failed to appreciate their legitimate concerns for too long, May says. But she will lay out an agenda for how mainstream politics can address this. Davos\u2019s founder Klaus Schwab has taken the stage, to introduce Theresa May. Schwab says he was born before world war 2 broke out - for him, Europe was a big dream of never having war again, and feeling united. He says he\u2019s very pleased to hear Theresa May say that the UK will not leave Europe, but will have a very amicable divorce. Hammond and Khan are now chatting together, as we wait for the PM... Chancellor Philip Hammond just marched into the hall, not far behind Sadiq Khan. Even the global elite have to queue sometimes. There\u2019s a massive line snaking around the conference now, as delegates try to bag a decent seat to watch Theresa May in 25 minutes. There\u2019s a flurry of activity as some of the global elite head into a private meeting in the heart of the WEF conference centre. It looks like an IGWEL - or Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders in the Davos jargon. I\u2019ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and HSBC chairman Douglas Flint arriving (you can see Lagarde here) One insider says they\u2019ll be discussing sustainable development; hopefully they\u2019ll still catch Theresa May\u2019s speech too. London mayor Sadiq Khan is also in Davos today. He\u2019s been meeting with business leaders, and arguing for Britain to get privileged access to the single market. He\u2019s just giving an interview to the BBC now, saying that his message to EU leaders is not to assume the Brexit vote was a one-off. Unless you address the concerns around globalisation, unless you address these issues, if there\u2019s a vote in your country whether to stay or leave the EU don\u2019t be surprised if your voters decide to leave the EU. Good morning from Davos, and day three of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. Theresa May swept into the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re hotel in the centre of this ski resort last night, on the latest stage in her push for Brexit. The UK PM is the hottest act in town today; at 10.15am local time (9.15am GMT) she will deliver a special address to an audience of fellow world leaders, business chiefs and economists. The speech gets top billing: Britain after Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will spell out the economic implications of leaving the European Union May is expected to talk about those who have not prospered under globalisation; linking the Brexit vote into a broader theme that has dominated talk at Davos this week already. One Downing Street source told Sky News overnight that: \u201cThe PM is reflecting themes she\u2019s spoken about before - that change has to come in order to benefit who have been left behind.\u201d May\u2019s likely to use the speech to pitch for more global trade, saying Britain remains open to business despite voting to leave the EU. The speech could also include a hard-hitting section on modern slavery; a priority for May since her days as Britain\u2019s Home Secretary. May is also meeting bank chiefs in Davos, such as Wall Street bosses who are wondering whether to start moving jobs and operations out of the City in anticipation of the UK leaving the single market. Bloomberg: May Meets Wall Streeters in Davos as Banks Plan Brexit Exodus It could be a tricky Davos debut for May; the Guardian reports this morning that European leaders are presenting a united front ahead of the EU exit talks. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, led the way, predicted that negotiating Brexit will be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d But May has allies here too; chancellor Philip Hammond will meet with a clutch of UK business chiefs at a lunch later. We\u2019ve also spied Liam Fox; the Secretary of international trade told us last night that he\u2019s here to make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action from Davos through the day...",

But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. <br></p> <p>Speaking on Skai TV this morning, <strong>Nikos Xydakis</strong>, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, <strong>Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou</strong> similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. </p> <p>In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner <strong>Anna Diamantopoulou</strong> demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5890a055e4b0e481c6e49340\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T14:45:18.089Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b0e8abd8cc2dadf6c5f896ba4e0e1607a8f8a665\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e8abd8cc2dadf6c5f896ba4e0e1607a8f8a665/0_0_2748_3802/723.jpg\" alt=\"The Wall Street sign and the front of the New York Stock Exchange in New York.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders.</p> <p><strong>FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States.</p> <p>While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58909bd1e4b0f1550c0dadaf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T14:22:51.370Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6091f3cd41e80f374a3d4863f91429f86a3b468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6091f3cd41e80f374a3d4863f91429f86a3b468/0_0_5072_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sweden\u2019s Prime minister Stefan Lofven giving a press conference in Stockholm today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sweden\u2019s Prime minister Stefan Lofven giving a press conference in Stockholm today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/31/eurozone-gdp-french-economy-grows-unemployment-germany-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-58907897e4b0b3e971af5115#block-58907897e4b0b3e971af5115\"> Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism:</a></strong></p> <p>Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed.</p> <p> \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The new US administration has opened up a new front against Europe, accusing Germany of unfairly profiting from the \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro. Peter Navarro, who heads up Donald Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, made the comments in an FT interview today. The comments sent the euro spiking; it\u2019s now at its highest level since November. But German chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to rebuff the comments, saying that Germany can\u2019t control the value of the euro anyway. New data has shown that Europe\u2019s economy continues to recover -- and that price pressures are building. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, new data shows, meaning that it grew faster last year than America. Inflation is also on the rise; the consumer prices index jumped by 1.8% year-on-year. But the increase was mainly due to energy prices, with core inflation remaining at 0.9%. There was also relief that the eurozone jobless rate fell again, to 9.6% in December. But the divisions in Europe were clear to see - with Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hitting a post-reunification low, while Italy\u2019s remains at the highest since July 2015. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Greece\u2019s deadlocked talks with creditors have once more raised the spectre of Grexit. And back across the Atlantic, US consumer confidence dropped in January from the fifteen year high seen in December. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite a busy day for economic and corporate news, the actions of the Trump administration were once again at the forefront of investors minds. The fallout of Trump\u2019s ban on travel, his firing of the acting attorney general, followed by the attack on the euro and Germany by his top trade advisor, have all added to the mood of growing uncertainty. Some unimpressive updates have not helped. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said A double whammy in the form of misses for the Chicago PMI and consumer confidence on the economic front, plus a poor set of numbers from economic bellwether UPS, have resulted in a continuation of yesterday\u2019s risk-off atmosphere. Only in London is the mood more optimistic, where once again it is the FTSE\u2019s mining contingent that is helping to [support] the index. In the end the FTSE also succumbed to the negative mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.27% or 19.33 points at 7099.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.25% to 11,535.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% lower at 4748.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.9% to 18,590.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.49% lower at 9315.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.38% to 611.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 138 points or 0.7%. It\u2019s probably no surprise that market volatility is on the rise after the first few days of the Trump presidency. And after a dip on Monday it is back up again: Despite the drop in US consumer confidence, it is still at fairly high levels. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Although slightly down on last month\u2019s historic high US consumer confidence remains strong in the face of uncertainty. The US economy is enjoying robust numbers at the moment and Fed Chair Janet Yellen will likely be inching closer to the first of three possible interest rate rises this year. American citizens appear to be confident in the potential growth of business conditions, stock prices and jobs. However, the world\u2019s largest economy is now being steered by an unpredictable new leader in the form of Donald Trump and the year ahead could still be bumpy. That didn\u2019t last long... US consumer confidence has dropped, having spiked in the aftermath of the US election victory. America\u2019s Conference Board reports that its consumer confidence index dipped to 111.8 this month, down from the fifteen-year high struck in December. Over to Greece where deadlocked talks with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat have once again raised the spectre of Grexit and the need for contingency plans. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: It is a scenario that in the ranks of Syriza, the governing left-wing party, no one openly wants. But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. Speaking on Skai TV this morning, Nikos Xydakis, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d \u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked. Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting. \u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015. \u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901. Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that: Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States. While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment. Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism: Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said: \u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed. \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is.\u201d City experts aren\u2019t convinced by Peter Navarro\u2019s comments about the euro: Here\u2019s former UBS chief economist George Magnus: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets: Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye Risk Management, is even less impressed: Newsflash: German chancellor Angela Merkel has responded to Peter Navarro\u2019s attack. She says that Germany cannot influence the value of the euro, and that the country has always pushed for the European Central Bank to be independent. Does Peter Navarro have a point, when he claims Germany is exploiting other countries through its cheap currency? Well.... Germany posted a record trade surplus in 2015, and will probably do the same when 2016\u2019s numbers are added up. Cheap currencies boost exports, and no-one would argue that the euro would be more valuable if you removed the weaker members from the currency bloc. Back in 2015, former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke blogged that the German trade surplus was \u201ca problem\u201d for the global economy. He argued that Berlin should boost government spending, and workers\u2019 wages, to help drive it down. However.... Bernanke also pointed out that Germany has little control over the value of the euro. It has fallen near to parity with the US dollar because the European Central Bank has slashed interest rates to record lows (unpopular in Germany), imposed negative rates on banks (unpopular in Germany) and created tens of billions of euros to buy government bonds (unpopular in Germany). Currency wars aren\u2019t a new issue either. NBC correspondent Hans Nichols points out that the Obama administration had its own concerns about the euro, when it was stronger: The prospect of a currency spat between the US and the eurozone has pushed the euro up against all major currencies. The single currency is up 0.7% against the dollar now, to $1.0764, after Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed it was \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d. This means the US dollar is still on track to post its worst January since 2008 (as recorded earlier). The euro has also gained 0.6% against the pound to 86.1p, meaning one pound is worth \u20ac1.1608. Peter Navarro\u2019s attack on Germany over the euro shows that the Trump administration are concerned about countries who run a trade surplus with the US. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Citigroup global econonomics director Ebrahim Rahbari says that \u201ctalking about a currency is much easier than taking specific measures\u201d. Currency rates have clearly been under discussion for some time, at forums such as the G20, Rahbari points out. So Navarro is \u201cratcheting up the discussions that have previously taken place\u201d, he concludes. Hold onto your hats, folks. The Financial Times is reporting that one of Donald Trump\u2019s advisers has hit out at Germany, saying it gets an unfair advantage due to the weakness of the euro. Here\u2019s the story, by the FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan: Germany is using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to exploit the US and its EU partners, Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser has said in comments that are likely to trigger alarm in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Peter Navarro, the head of Mr Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, told the Financial Times the euro was like an \u201cimplicit Deutsche Mark\u201d whose low valuation gave Germany an advantage over its main partners. His views suggest the new administration is focusing on currency as part of its hard-charging approach on trade ties. In a departure from past US policy, Mr Navarro also called Germany one of the main hurdles to a US trade deal with the EU and declared talks with the bloc over a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership dead. Here\u2019s the full story: Trump\u2019s top trade adviser accuses Germany of currency exploitation The euro is now rising sharply against the US dollar, as traders anticipate action from Washington over this issue. It\u2019s gained almost 0.5% to \u20ac1.074. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the news that eurozone growth and inflation have risen, while the unemployment rate has hit a new seven-year low. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: In the Eurozone GDP figures have been released this morning. Inflation in Spain has increased to 3% as has the cost of living in France, up by 1.4%; while the broader EU CPI measure jumped to 1.8% largely driven by a jump in energy prices. The French economy grew 1.1% in 2016 slightly less than expected but despite this Michel Sapin, the French minister of finance, insisted the French economy is still moving in the right direction and reducing unemployment. Overall, Eurozone GDP came in at 0.5% for the last quarter which was better than forecast and unemployment fell. All this positive data suggests the Eurozone is recovering slowly, though Italy continues to remain a weak point. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity: Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, A fresh and intricate new conundrum has reared its ugly head for Mario Draghi this morning as the pressure of a significant uplift in German inflation has pushed the Eurozone figure up to 1.8% for January. The renown \u2018powerhouse\u2019 of the Eurozone is now putting significant pressure on the ECB President as euro-sceptics are quickly pointing out that stimulus measures are falling far short of creating a balanced and improved bloc state. Whilst GDP saw an uplift this morning, as well as a diminishing Unemployment rate also posted, inflation has, and will be for the foreseeable future, the focus. With such wild swings upwards, Draghi will have to adopt Monetary policy accordingly, which at present isn\u2019t hugely clear as to what path he should, or is willing to take. Many analysts suggest Quantitative Easing is falling far short of improving the economic situation, and Draghi always notes \u2018other tools\u2019 which he can, and will adopt - perhaps now is the time for him to lay his cards on the table, so to speak. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: The ECB has been wont to point out that core inflation remains a problem and the uptick in prices might not last. And again this remains stubbornly below the headline figure at just 0.9%. No cause for the ECB to tighten monetary policy just yet but refreshingly upbeat figures nonetheless. The data is improving in Europe but there is as yet no sign of anything other than monetary policy divergence between the Fed and European Central Bank. Greece\u2019s debt problems won\u2019t go away and political risks are abundant. The eurozone didn\u2019t manage to match Britain\u2019s economy, though. UK GDP grew by 0.6% in the last three months of 2016, and by 2.2% during the year. The eurozone outperformed the United States last year. Today\u2019s growth figures show that the eurozone expanded by 1.8% in 2016; last Friday, we learned that America only grew by 1.6%. This is the first time the Eurozone has grown faster than the US in a calendar year since 2008, when the financial crisis struck. Eurozone politicians will be delighted to see the region\u2019s jobless rate fall to 9.6% (not 9.8% as I mistyped earlier, sorry). This is the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. The jobless rate across the European Union came in at 8.2%, unchanged from November, and the lowest since February 2009. The lowest rates were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany, while Greece suffered the worst jobless rate (23.0% in October 2016) followed by Spain (18.4%). There are still 20.065 million men and women out of work in the EU, including 15.571 million in the euro area. And young people are still finding it hard to find work; in December 2016, the youth unemployment rate was 18.6% in the EU28 and 20.9% in the euro area, compared with 19.5% and 21.8% respectively in December 2015. Important point: eurozone core inflation (which strips out food and energy) was only 0.9% this month, rather than the headline figure of 1.8%. That\u2019s little comfort to households facing a cash squeeze, but it does give the European Central Bank a good reason not to be bounced into changing monetary policy. Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, explains: \u201cHeadline inflation is clearly picking up in the Eurozone, but a lot of that is linked to energy price base effects (+8.1% compared with +2.6% in December). As highlighted in their most recent press conference, the ECB itself is willing to look through these transient gains. As such, we believe that it is too early to call for any sort of further \u201ctapering\u201d in the region, especially ahead of a very busy political agenda. Growth up, inflation up, unemployment down.... On an annual basis, the eurozone grew by 1.8% last year - up from 1.5% in 2015. My Reuters machine is gasping for air as a burst of newsflashes ripple out from the eurozone, giving new insights into the European economy. New growth figures show that the euro area grew by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, suggesting the region\u2019s recovery is picking up pace. But inflation has jumped by more than expected, to 1.8% in January. That\u2019s the highest in almost four-years, driven by a steep rise in energy prices. The European Central Bank\u2019s target is to keep inflation just below 2% - these figures are surely going to fuel calls for the ECB to stop its bond-buying stimulus programme, and consider pushing interest rates up. And the unemployment rate across the region has dropped to 9.6% in December  , a new seven-year low. Details and reaction to follow.... The latest unemployment news from Italy is rather disappointing. The Italian jobless rate came in at 12% in December, higher than expected, while November\u2019s reading has been revised up from 11.9% to 12%. These are the highest readings since July 2015. The US dollar is poised to suffer its worst start to any year since 2008. The greenback has fallen by 1.9% against a basket of currencies this month, partly thanks to yesterday\u2019s selloff as Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders alarmed traders. The pound, for example, has gained over 1.5 cents against the US dollar this month, from $1.233 to $1.25. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says it\u2019s very hard to know how the markets will react to Trump. President Trump\u2019s travel ban - and his associated decision to fire the acting Attorney General - dominates sentiment and remains good for Treasuries, the yen (and gold), but bad for bonds and the dollar. How long will market sentiment to be affected? How far can the dollar and yields fall on this? I\u2019m not sure serious analysis is possible, and I don\u2019t trust my gut instincts on something as far from the usual state of affairs, but my bias is still that we\u2019ll get back to the Trump economic program, and the implications for Fed policy, before too long. More prosaically, markets will focus on the US jobs data due Friday. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s jobs market remains as strong as ever. The unemployment total in Europe\u2019s largest economy has fallen again this month, by 26,000 people, to 2.605m. That takes Germany\u2019s jobless rate down to 5.9%. UK online supermarket group Ocado is the best performing stock across Europe, jumping by 6.5%. It posted a 21% jump in pre-tax profits this morning, to \u00a314.5m, and told shareholders it was busier than ever, in its long-running attempt to sign an overseas deal. The only problem is that we\u2019ve been waiting YEARS for Ocado to team up with an international partner. The company insists there are plenty of suiters in the wings, but there\u2019s still no actual agreement. Retail analyst Nick Bubb predicts: Management will have to put up with more questions from the City today about the failure to deliver an Overseas deal in the analysts meeting at 9.30am\u2026 European stock markets have opened nervously, following those losses in Asia overnight. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has inched up by 0.2%, while the French CAC and German DAX are both flat. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says investors are juggling political and economic concerns right now. It\u2019s been an interesting start to the week, with protests against President Trump\u2019s immigration ban dominating market news and reaction. Trump\u2019s use of executive power has not stopped with immigration; on Monday he signed a new order that will cap business regulation. While politics took centre stage at the start of the week, earnings from Apple and Exxon on later today, along with a flurry of central bank meetings this week will be critical for determining what matters more to markets right now: politics or economics. Back to GDP....and Austria has posted another quarter of solid growth. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, matching the (upwardly revised) growth in July-September. Austria\u2019s statistics body said that consumer spending and investment were the main factors behind the growth, as in France. Newsflash: Inflation in Spain has surged this month, to 3% on an EU-harmonised basis. The cost of living in France has accelerated too, jumping from 0.8% to 1.6% . The rises are mainly due to higher energy prices, and it suggests the eurozone inflation rate, due in two hour\u2019s time, has also risen sharply this month. If so, there\u2019ll be a lot more pressure on the European Central Bank to consider tightening its stimulus programme, especially from Germany (where inflation jumped to 1.9%, according to figures released on Monday). Asian stock markets have had another poor day, as fears about Donald Trump\u2019s actions continue to rile investors. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 1.7%, its biggest drop since October, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.7%. On Monday, global markets suffered their biggest one-day drop in six weeks, amid global condemnation of the US president\u2019s travel ban on seven countries in the Middle East. The news that Trump had fired attorney general Sally Yates after she instructed lawyers not to defend the ban has added to the nervous mood, and fears that Trump is destabilising the world order. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says (via Reuters): Investors are becoming worried as it appears as if he was setting fire to geopolitical risks that already exist. We don\u2019t have any growth figures from Germany today. Instead, we\u2019ve got a nasty fall in retail spending. German retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in December, dashing hopes of a recovery after a 1.7% drop in November. These figures are often volatile, but it could suggest consumers in Europe\u2019s largest economy were cautious in the run-up to Christmas. Outgoing French president Francois Hollande will surely be pleased that the economy is growing, but his successor still faces a big challenge: German journalist Gesche W\u00fcpper points out that France\u2019s growth during 2016 was weaker than hoped, at just 1.1% for the year. Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets this graph, showing how France\u2019s growth has been volatile and unspectacular over the last few years: Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group, shows how France (in green) has lagged behind Sweden, the US, Germany and the UK over the last decade. France has got Eurozone GDP Day off to a good start, by reporting that its economy accelerated in the last three months of 2016. French GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December quarter, twice as fast as in July-September. This suggests that France\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis continues, despite the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote last summer. The figures also show that France\u2019s economy grew by 1.1% during 2016. Statistics body INSEE says that consumer and business spending drove the recovery. \u201cHousehold consumption expenditures\u201d rose by 0.6% during the month. while \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d jumped by 0.8%. Exports were \u201cmore dynamic\u201d, rising by +1.1% during the quarter while imports grew by 0.8%. And that means foreign trade balance contributed slightly to GDP growth: +0.1 points after \u22120.7 points in the previous quarter. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be looking at Europe\u2019s economy this morning, as new data are released showing how the eurozone is performing. The first estimate of eurozone GDP for the last quarter of 2016, due at 10am GMT, may show that growth picked up to +0.4%, from +0.3%. We\u2019ll also get some figures from individual countries, including France. The latest eurozone unemployment figures are also due at 10am GMT; economists reckon the jobless rate will stick at 9.8% again, the lowest since 2009. But Italy\u2019s figures, due at 9am GMT, will surely show that its recovery is lagging behind. Plus, the latest estimate of eurozone inflation is released (yup, also at 10am GMT). We also get German retail sales figures for December at 7am; they\u2019re expected to bounce back by around 0.6% after shrinking by 1.8% in November. And at 8am, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving speech on \u201cInto the future: Europe\u2019s digital integrated market\u201d in Frankfurt, Germany. Europe\u2019s financial markets are expected to be subdued, following yesterday\u2019s losses as investors watched the backlash against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day...",
