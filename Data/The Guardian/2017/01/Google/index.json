                "bodyText":"The Daily Mirror group, Trinity Mirror, has confirmed it is back in talks with Richard Desmond about a potential tie-up with Express Newspapers, owner of the Express and the Star. Trinity Mirror, which has seen its share price fall by 42% in the last year, said it was in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153early stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talks with Desmond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Northern &amp; Shell, the parent company of Express Newspapers. The talks are also thought to involve Desmond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK! magazine, which was part of the negotiations two years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The board of Trinity Mirror notes the recent media speculation and confirms that it is at an early stage of discussions towards taking a minority interest in a new company comprising certain of Northern &amp; Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said in an announcement to the stock market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No offer has been made and there is no certainty that any agreement will be reached.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The two companies held talks about a potential deal two years ago. The negotiations fizzled out, however, over disagreements about price and the pension deficit at Desmond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paper. Negotiations, which are thought to have started late last year, are focused on a potential merger of back office and sales operations to make significant savings. The talks come as UK national newspaper publishers including Trinity Mirror, the Telegraph, the Sun and Times owner News UK and the Guardian explore combining print and digital advertising sales to fight back against the growing dominance of Google and Facebook. Express Newspapers is not involved in the initiative, Project Juno. In May last year, the firm reported it had more than tripled pre-tax profits in 2015 to \u00c2\u00a330.5m after slashing staff and printing costs. Desmond has been thinning his media portfolio in recent years, selling Channel 5 to MTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Viacom, for \u00c2\u00a3463m in 2014. He also sold his adult TV business in April last year, including the Television X and Red Hot channels, severing his last link with the industry that helped make him a billionaire. He sold his adult magazine titles including Asian Babes and Big Ones for about \u00c2\u00a320m in 2004. Desmond acquired Express Newspapers in 2000 for \u00c2\u00a3125m. He was seeking more than \u00c2\u00a3100m to take full control of Express Newspapers and OK! in the talks held two years ago. Northern &amp; Shell also owns the loss-making Health Lottery. Last year, Trinity Mirror looked at buying Evgeny Lebedev\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s i newspaper, the cut-price national newspaper originally launched to support the Independent. It was outbid by the regional publisher Johnston Press, which acquired i for \u00c2\u00a324.4m last February. Lebedev closed the print editions of the Independent and Independent on Sunday the following month. In a bid to drive growth in the national newspaper market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like other publishers, Trinity has seen consistent double-digit declines in print advertising \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the company moved to launch its own low-cost title in February. The New Day, which had a \u00c2\u00a35m launch with the tagline \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seize the New Day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, closed after just two months. When the last talks between Desmond and Trinity Mirror broke down, the Mirror publisher secured a \u00c2\u00a3220m deal to buy the regional newspaper publisher Local World. The deal added more than 100 regional newspaper titles to Trinity Mirror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing 130 local papers, spanning titles from the Nottingham Post and Cambridge News to the Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo. Trinity Mirror and Northern &amp; Shell declined to comment. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 10 July 2017. An earlier version said The New Day launched in May 2016.

We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference will be rising inequality, which the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\"> WEF has warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\">is the biggest problem facing the world. </a>The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential victory, had led the west to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Combating rising insecurity and inequality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to be introduced by the WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153visual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>The extra Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re staff include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. </p> <p>The Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. </p> <p>The Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel.

Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00c2\u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I assume [the staff] get good tips,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kleber said, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most of them are not coming for the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard work, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of fun,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. </p> <p>Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration as the 45th US president.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2016/01/22/jack_ma_davos_party.php\">Cameron was photographed partying</a> tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00c2\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events.</p> <p>Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00c2\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. </p> <p>To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/strategic-partners\">Strategic Partners</a> of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. </p> <p>Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Annual_Report_2015-2016.pdf\">its annual report</a>. </p> <p>The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/economics-blog/2017/jan/11/are-americans-more-ready-to-accept-inequality-donald-trump\">Are Americans more ready to accept inequality?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parties as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153endless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

In its <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2017\">annual global risks report</a> the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before.</p> <p>Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00c2\u00a37,860. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos.

May is not listed to appear on any panels, and the No 10 press office declined to provide any details of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s itinerary. David Cameron used his speech at Davos last year to reassure global business leaders that Britain would stay in the European Union.

She follows in the footsteps of other celebrities, including Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am, who have spoken at Davos to promote their charitable interests. Shakira will be promoting her Pies Descalzos / Barefoot Foundation, which helps provide education to poor and vulnerable children.</p> <p><strong>Matt Damon</strong></p> <p>The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting actor will be at Davos to talk about his continuing efforts to provide clean water to developing countries.

In 2014, Damon told Davos that having travelled in developing countries he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153started to get a real appreciation for the magnitude of the water crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p><strong>Xi Jinping</strong></p> <p>The Chinese president will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to Davos.

                "bodyText":"Hundreds of chambermaids, doormen and cocktail waiters have been flown to Davos to cater to every whim of world leaders, business executives and the super-rich who will descend next week on the Swiss Alps town for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) celebration of capitalism. While WEF guests, including Theresa May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and South African president Jacob Zuma, will spend their nights in some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most luxurious hotel suites, the staff brought in to serve them will be sleeping up to five to a room in bunk beds. The manager of the fanciest hotel in Davos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Grandhotel Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said he had flown in 200 extra staff to work in shifts around the clock during the annual jamboree of the rich and powerful. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We normally have about 100 employees, but this week we have 300 to help us out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas Kleber, general manager of the Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re, said. Kleber said the extra staff have been flown in from partner hotels across the world to help out during the Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busiest week of the year, but because the whole of Davos is packed out with forum visitors there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much space to accommodate the additional workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a staff house, but at this time of the year it is getting cosy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explained. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do have some different places with four or five people in one room. We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference will be rising inequality, which the WEF has warned is the biggest problem facing the world. The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential victory, had led the west to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Combating rising insecurity and inequality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to be introduced by the WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153visual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The extra Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re staff include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. The Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver. Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ice sculptures are always part of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00c2\u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I assume [the staff] get good tips,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kleber said, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most of them are not coming for the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard work, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of fun,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration as the 45th US president. Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, Cameron was photographed partying tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00c2\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events. Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00c2\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become Strategic Partners of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to its annual report. The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parties as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153endless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World. Many of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two richest men, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00c3\u00bcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them. Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. The increase in private jet flights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its annual global risks report the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before. Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00c2\u00a37,860. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos. The parties there have become a place to be. Davos is now on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe circuit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 along with the Superbowl, the Champions League final and the Monaco Grand Prix.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rich and powerful at Davos Christine Lagarde The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a firm fixture at the WEF, and will participate in at least three panels at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Squeezed and Angry: How to fix the middle-class crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and another on how to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenge stereotypes and institutional inertia to achieve gender parity within our lifetimes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as well as being keynote speaker on the wider challenges facing the economy this year. Lagarde, formerly a French minister, was recently found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence. The court decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support. Theresa May The UK prime minister will be at Davos for the first time this year. May is not listed to appear on any panels, and the No 10 press office declined to provide any details of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s itinerary. David Cameron used his speech at Davos last year to reassure global business leaders that Britain would stay in the European Union. Cameron said he wanted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confront this issue, I want to deal with it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My aim is absolutely clear: I want to secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Shakira The Grammy award-winning Colombian singer-songwriter will be at Davos in her role as a global ambassador for Unicef. She follows in the footsteps of other celebrities, including Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am, who have spoken at Davos to promote their charitable interests. Shakira will be promoting her Pies Descalzos / Barefoot Foundation, which helps provide education to poor and vulnerable children. Matt Damon The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting actor will be at Davos to talk about his continuing efforts to provide clean water to developing countries. Damon, who founded charity Water.org, will speak at a session hosted by CNBC. In 2014, Damon told Davos that having travelled in developing countries he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153started to get a real appreciation for the magnitude of the water crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Xi Jinping The Chinese president will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to Davos. He is the first Chinese president to attend the WEF, and his visit is a statement of intent that China wants to assume a global leadership role as other world powers struggle with domestic tumult. Joe Biden The outgoing US vice-president will be at Davos, which runs until Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the same day as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration. Biden, who will travel to Switzerland on Air Force 2, will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliver remarks on the cancer moonshot and deliver an address on foreign policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the White House said. Sheryl Sandberg The chief operating officer of Facebook, who has amassed a $1.3bn fortune from the social network according to Forbes, will speak at a panel about how older world leaders can harness the optimism of youth. The panel also includes: Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard; Last King of Scotland actor Forest Whitaker, and Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia. Sir Martin Sorrell Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-paid boss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who collected \u00c2\u00a370.5m from his advertising company WPP last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will speak at a panel entitled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Size Matters: The Future of Big Business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They will discuss how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fewer than 10% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public companies account for 80% of all profits. What does operating at this scale mean for competition, collaboration and innovation?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eric Schmidt The chairman of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet is a regular at Davos, although he is not lined up to speak at any panels this year. Schmidt, 61, is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 36th richest man with a $11bn fortune, according to Forbes.

Jamie Oliver The British celebrity chef-turned businessman will be interviewed by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153driving a healthy and sustainable food revolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Oliver, who is worth $400m according to the Sunday Times rich list, was recently forced to close six of his Italian restaurants after tough trading and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pressures and unknowns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following the Brexit vote.

The FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning.</p> <p>Ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell.

A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that.</p> <p><em>On the customs union:</em></p> <p>Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK.</p> <p><em>On globalisation:</em></p> <p> I think what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the economy of the future, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone.</p> <p><em>On the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness:</em></p> <p>Well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good strength, I believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p><em>And on technology and jobs:</em></p> <p>Well I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. <br></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-19/may-tells-banks-she-values-them-as-they-pack-their-brexit-bags\">Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s write-up</a> of the interview.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:20:15.585Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f01ee4b00b8fc2ae2666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:59:15.534Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes people feel globalization has &quot;left them behind,&quot; Theresa May says <a href=\"https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN\">https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5NaC9Y37cx\">pic.twitter.com/5NaC9Y37cx</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880ece5e4b0f0efb00f5cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nickfletcher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:54:45.388Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve had &quot;positive discussions&quot; with big banks about jobs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal\">@bbckamal</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/davos2017?src=hash\">#davos2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd\">https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FUjE1fEKMs\">pic.twitter.com/FUjE1fEKMs</a></p>&mdash; BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p>Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy.</p> <p>She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/822122563610480642\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of what UK PM May said in that BTV interview has already been discounted...

                "bodyText":"Here are some of the key quotes from George Soros, for those who missed his interview here in Davos tonight (delegates are now polishing off the pudding and wine in the Seehof Hotel) In my opinion is is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament.And I think she will not last. At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted, and they live in hope.But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise as fast as the cost of living. The divorce is going to take a very long time. Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning. Hmmmm, maybe George. And on Europe, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One has to recognize that the European Union has become too complicated and people are alienated. The anti-European parties are gathering force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from Davos. Goodnight!! GW Soros also took a swipe at Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government, which is threatening to crack down on the non-government agencies he funds. He reads out a statement, saying that these threats against civil society are an affront to European values. Before anyone mistakes George Soros for Cassandra, lets remember that he predicted a year ago that Europe would disintegrate. He now says it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - because neither Vladimir Putin nor China want it to fail. This session is being streamed live on Bloomberg TV, for anyone who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made it to the Seehof hotel in Davos. Soros is taking questions from the room now -- and accepting them by email too, at sorosdavos2017@gmail.com Onto China....and Soros says Beijing would have no choice but to retaliate if Donald Trump labelled it a currency manipulator. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much harder to get divorced than to get married, Soros continues, explaining why the Brexit process will take a long time. And he even suggests that Britain could quit the EU on a Friday, and rejoin on the Monday (!) George Soros now declares that it is unlikely that prime minister Theresa May will remain in power for long. She has already got a divided cabinet and a small majority in parliament....I think she will not last, Soros tells his audience of Davos delegates. The people in the UK are in denial, Soros continues. The current economic situation is not as bad as expected, so they live in hope, but as the currency depreciates, inflation will lead to a decline in living standards. It will take time, but when it happens they will realise they are not as well off as before, Soros concludes. If Europe breaks down, the consequences will be very dire, Soros concludes. And currently it is going in the wrong direction. Q: How will Brexit play out? I hope that both sides realise they must find some common ground. A bitter divorce would hurt both sides - And the divorce will be a long process. But when people realise they are going in the wrong direction, they will come together. Soros cites the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent story that Michel Barnier was pushing for a special deal for the City. Last year was a disaster for Europe, Soros continues, with the Brexit vote and the Italian election. Europe has become too complicated, and people are alienated - the anti-European parties are gathering force and the future looks very bleak Hello again from the Seehof hotel in Davos, where veteran billionaire investor/philantropist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. On Donald Trump, Soros says he has described Trump as an imposter, a conman and a would-be dictator. But he is confident that the constitution of the US and division of power will hold sway. He would be a dictator if he could get away with it..but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. When Trump oversteps the mark, they will fight back, Soros predicts. He believes that Trump was surprised to win the November election.....he was engaged in building his brand and his success in attracting crowds. Soros says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convinced that Trump will fail - not because people want him to, but because the ideas that drive him are essentially contradictory. For example, he has three chiefs of staff instead of one, and there will be tensions within his cabinet - meaning a lot of infighting in future. And that means that the markets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t maintain recent gains, Soros predicts: Right now, uncertainty is at its peak, and uncertainty is the enemy of long-term investment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all winding down in the WEF conference centre now; but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hoping to cover an interview/dinner with George Soros at around 8.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT) Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish comments at the latest European Central Bank meeting sent the euro lower and also helped push European markets marginally into the red. And with the dollar also weaker against the pound, the FTSE 100 also fell back - unsurprising given much of its recent gains have been due to the weakness of sterling boosting overseas earners. After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, while stating that the ECB stands \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This was exactly what the euro didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter... In the UK the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning. Ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%. As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1590. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview with Bloomberg TV. On bank jobs leaving London: Well I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that. On the customs union: Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK. On globalisation: I think what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the economy of the future, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone. On the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness: Well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good strength, I believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom. And on technology and jobs: Well I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. And here is Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s write-up of the interview. Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace. Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future. This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy. She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reckons that European leaders won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be scared by Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to slash taxes and regulation if Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a good Brexit deal. May and Hammond had two aims in Davos. The first was to convince UK business leaders they had a plan, an objective largely achieved even among those that think tough times lie ahead. The second was to smooth things over with businesses and politicians in the rest of Europe, which has been far less successful. May and Hammond seem oblivious to the current level of hostility towards the UK. Nor is the May-Hammond \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iron fist in the velvet glove\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd routine likely to make the rest of Europe soften its hard line in the negotiations. Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hong Kong. The EU 27 will see scorched earth as an empty threat. Which it is. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his full analysis: Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres, the new head of the United Nations, has singled out youth unemployment as a major threat to global security. In a keynote speech, Guterres says that: The scourge of youth unemployment is probably the worst problem we are facing today, with consequences for the wellbeing of the people involved, societies, and global security too. Young unemployment people in several parts of the world are the largest area of recruitment for terrorist groups. Guterres also warns that we live in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today; countries must bolster their efforts to deliver peace. The euro has weakened on Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first press conference of 2017, with investors interpreting his stance as largely dovish. After announcing its decision to leave key interest rates and the quantitative easing (QE) programme unchanged at its 1,000th board meeting, the ECB president highlighted downside risks to the eurozone economy from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and noted a lack of underlying upward pressure on inflation. Much of the recent rise in inflation, he says, is down to energy price movements and he also pointed out nominal wages growth remains subdued. There is more of that in his opening statement. Draghi appeared keen to send the message that the ECB remains ready to do more to shore up the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery as necessary. Draghi said there was no discussion of tapering - the process of winding down QE. In the wake of criticism from German politicians over how low interest rates were hurting those with savings, he also called on people to be patient with the ECB. He patiently fielded several questions on German low rate angst. To the likely disappointment of reporters at the news conference, the ECB president dodged a question on whether Donald Trump could make life more difficult for those charged with safeguarding the euro after the president elect said in an interview that it would be a struggle keeping the euro together. A careful Draghi said: I just won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any comment on that... I would rather comment on policies and policy actions than just statements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His apparently relaxed stance on inflation left the euro down 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.0600 by the end of the news conference. Against the pound it is down 0.6% on the day to 86.19 pence. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 share index turned positive after the apparent promise of ultra-low interest rates for a very long time to come. Commenting on the tone of the press conference, David Lamb sums up the likely reaction of German politicians: In Berlin, Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwavering dovishness will go down about as well as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hints of tariffs on German cars... With the money-printing set to continue until further notice, inflationary pressures will return and the euro has taken an immediate hit. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima says the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdrace to the bottom on corporate tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd needs to be addressed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying now. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the promise from president-elect Trump to cut corporate tax. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard Theresa May threatening to make Britain a little island with low tax rates on the shores of Europe. These are steps in the wrong direction. This year we need to see progress on this corporate tax competition. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just an issue of legal compliance, Byanyima continues. The local corner shop where I buy bread probably pays a higher tax rate than Apple. We want to see big companies take this as more than a legal compliance, and see it as a moral issue to society - to provide their fair share to fund heath, education, to create jobs for young people, she adds. Switzerland is now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfighting the good fight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 against tax avoidance today, says the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angel Gurria. Some background: the new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) come into effect in September 2017, when around 50 jurisdictions will work towards having their first information exchanges. Angel Gurria insists that real progress has been made in fighting tax avoidance and evasion. Back in 2008, there were 30 agreements to share tax information. Today there are 3,500, he says. The promise is enormous, and the potential is very great and it could really help these developing countries. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima is adamant that the current plans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough. Simply hiring more tax collectors doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address the use of tax loopholes, or the wider issue of low corporate tax rates. The transparency is good, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have public country-by-country recording -- if people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what firms are doing, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to get the secrecy out and tax them fairly. Panama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president points the finger at big companies for forcing tax breaks out of developing countries. Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado says some multinationals go to 3rd World companies and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insist on negotiating tax breaks that local companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in return for siting their operations there. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, reckons the global tax avoidance problem is probably even bigger than that $240bn figure. Morawiecki says that the three countries who make the most foreign direct investment into the European Union are the United States, then Switzerland, then Bermuda. And the list of FDI payments to countries from the EU is exactly the same (ie, the most goes to the US, then Switzerland then Bermuda). If this is not huge, global tax evasion, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what is. Tax avoidance is a human rights issue, declares Winnie Byanyima, executive director at Oxfam International. She tells her audience at WEF that Kenya is losing $1.1bn every year through tax incentives and tax exceptions. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost double its health budget; in a country where 1 in 40 children die at childbirth. This is really a human rights issue. Byanyima is much less optimist than the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angel Gurria - she agrees there is progress, but we have a long way to go. She brings a home truth to Davos too: First of all, the developing countries are not at the table, while a notorious tax haven like Switzerland had a place at the table. There is a harmful race to the bottom with countries offering lower tax rates to attract companies (something Philip Hammond has been hinting at), Byanyima adds, saying pointedly: If you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dodge taxes, you pay the government to lower the tax rate. Companies need to be forced to provide proper country-by-country reporting of their tax bills, she concludes, to get proper transparency: Yes we are moving, but not fast enough or broadly enough. Panama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president says her government understands the importance of taxes, both to fund Panama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending and to help other countries fight evasion. According to Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, Panama had been taking action since her government took office 2 and a half-years ago. Before the Panama Papers, President Varela had announced our commitment to automatic information sharing, to the United Nations. And then this leak came, which pointed out a global problem... A global problem which Panama needs to participate in the solution, and the rest of the world needs to participate in the solution. It made us run faster, we were already running. I can say today there is not one issue pending in Panama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steps to comply with international standards on information sharing, she adds. The panel begins by hearing that countries lose $240bn of tax revenues per year through tax avoidance by companies, according to the OECD 100 countries have signed to an information-sharing deal. Is it making a difference? Absolutely, says the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angel Gurria. And that includes Panama, which has signed up too. My message to the Panamanian Congress is - yes, pass the law. Complying with the tax system doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean changing it, it means enforcing it, Gurria continues. And next September, countries will start automatic information sharing - companies who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reported information correctly will be caught out. Nine months ago the Guardian exposed how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca was helping some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people, and its largest companies, avoid tax. Those revelations helped to drive the issue of aggressive tax avoidance high up the political agenda. Now, a heavyweight group at Davos are discussing how to get multinational companies to pay a fair share -- an issue Theresa May also highlighted in her speech. On the panel: Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada: Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Winnie Byanyima: Executive Director, Oxfam International Valdis Dombrovskis: Vice-President and Commissioner, Euro and Socia..., European Commission Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado: Vice-President of Panama Mateusz Morawiecki: Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some background reading while we wait for it to start: Chancellor Philip Hammond turned a bit lyrical when he spoke to business leaders today, telling them that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fog of Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was starting to lift. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not going to get rid of it overnight but I hope gradually it will start to lift. A few things are becoming clearer through the mist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The chancellor also stressed that the Government would do whatever necessary to ensure Britain remained competitive in the event that the rest of the EU cuts up rough in the divorce negotiations for Brexit. Hammond said: If somehow despite out best efforts political retribution were to triumph over economic logic, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a fair deal....we will have to do whatever was necessary to ensure the continued competitiveness in those circumstances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a threat. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He returned to the theme in the Q&amp;A session after his speech, saying that a free trade deal with the EU was not the only way for Britain to remain competitive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have reinvented ourselves before and we will do so again if we have to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere in Davos, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has taken another stride onto the world stage by announcing a major sponsorship deal with the Olympics. Ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alibaba has signed up until 2028, and will provide cloud computing services, and help build a new e-commerce platform to flog Olympic branded products to the masses. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also help develop and customise the Olympic Channel, a web site, for a Chinese audience. No pricing details, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been praising the City, at a lunch with top UK CEOs and journalists. Hammond warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfragmenting the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests, but he has also repeated his warning that the UK could lower taxes and regulations if it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a good Brexit deal: Hammond also touches on the customs union issue that is worrying Sir Angus Deaton: Away from Davos, the European Central Bank has confirmed it is leaving its key interest rates unchanged and not tinkering any more for now with its bond-buying programme, AKA quantitative easing (QE). Amid signs that inflation and growth are picking up, the Frankfurt-based central bank for the eurozone also stuck to its previous guidance that it stood ready to act should things take a turn for the worse. The full statement is here, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases... If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the [asset purchase] programme in terms of size and/or duration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We will get a clearer sense of how ECB policymakers see things when president Mario Draghi hosts a news conference at 13.30GMT. The ECB surprised markets in December by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn (\u00c2\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn currently. But whatever you do, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try and tell Mario Draghi that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tapering. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at Davos, alas) has responded to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today in Davos the Prime Minister talked about making globalisation work for all. But actions speak louder than words. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At every opportunity, the Conservatives have given handouts to the wealthiest and cut taxes for big business - while refusing to provide vital funds for the NHS, cutting social care and ditching rights at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision for Brexit is now clear: a bargain basement Britain on the shores of Europe based on low pay and deregulation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This week we heard the Prime Minister threaten to turn Britain into a tax haven, slashing corporate taxes and workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights in an all-out race to the bottom. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken in by warm words. This Conservative Government is backed to the hilt by wealthy elites, lines the pockets of its friends and resists all practical steps to make a fairer Britain work for all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nobel prize winner Sir Angus Deaton tells me that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech missed out some key issues. For starters, there was no mention of Scotland - Deaton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home country. He wants to be a member of the European Union, and a member of the United Kingdom - and now that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem possible. And on trade, Deaton says: I was also surprised she talked about free trade all the time, and she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk about the customs union. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain. So I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out. This was the first time that Deaton has watched May speak in the flesh, and he was reminded of an earlier Conservative leader. The immediate analogy when you see her for the first time is, this looks like Mrs Thatcher. But when you listen to her, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sort of the anti-Thatcher in some sense. Mrs Thatcher used to say there is no society, while she was talking about society. Mrs Thatcher would have not been very keen on taking us out of the EU. So it really is very different from Mrs Thatcher. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stern rebuke to businesses who are not paying a fair share of tax sounded good in the cavernous WEF hall. However, we should remember that Britain has been lowering its own corporation tax rate for years to attract firms to base here. And just last week, chancellor Philip Hammond threatened that the UK might abandon European-style regulations and taxes after Brexit, if the economy struggles. The leader of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition Liberal Democrat party, Tim Farron, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister certainly has a brass neck. She goes to Davos to lecture businesses about looking after the little guy yet she threatens to turn the UK into a Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tax haven. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This shows, yet again, that this Tory government are treating our country like UK plc. They are running our economy like it is a closing down sale. But higher prices and more expensive fuel mean families will feel the brunt of this government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad economic policies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech may have been a hot ticket at Davos and generally well received by those present, but the market reaction back home was far more muted than the wild gyrations seen during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit performance. For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy. The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day. Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail. London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brilliant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Theresa May is in Davos today. But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City. On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe. I think the fact she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a plan is welcome. I think the fact she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s here is brilliant But I think she needs to be listening to what our friends, chief executives, innovators, entrepreneurs, political leaders are saying, which is that no-one is bringing us bad will. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no bad feeling here. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no-one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe. Businesses that leave London aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Frankfurt, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Khan says he fully accepts the referendum result, but argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-one voted to make us poorer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So the government must make it a priority to get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileged access to the single market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so London can still attract talent. The good news is that over the last six months Google, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat have expanded their presence in London. But the bad news is that, as a consequence of the speech on Tuesday we have some banks and investment firms expressing unease about their future. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, has also given May a thumbs-up for her comments on making globalisation work. Speaking to AFP newswires here, she said: It was a good speech. She captured lots of the concerns about a responsible globalisation that we all talk about. Katherine Garrett-Cox, the former chief executive of Alliance Trust, tells me that Theresa May gave Davos what it wanted. I think she did a very good job of setting out a clear plan in terms of what Britain intends to do, what Britain intends to stand for, and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really what people wanted to hear. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously been a lot of criticism over the past six months over where does this start and where does it go. I think we heard very clearly that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the plan, and now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to get on and do it. Q: Can we do it, though, at the same time as negotiating Brexit? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all heard that the divorce, as people have called it, is going to be complicated and complex. But I think we all have to believe that we can do it, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your biggest concern now with Brexit? My biggest concern is that businesses step up and embrace the opportunity rather than constantly looking for the downside. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve grabbed a word with Dr Paul Sheard, the chief global economist of Standard &amp; Poors, outside the conference room. He says May gave a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd speech. Theresa May was laying down a stake and saying - Britain will be the lead supporting voice for globalisation in the world. A lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pivoting to saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno, this is about Britain being very global\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We now have two global leaders, President Xi Jinping and Theresa May, both making a pitch in support of globalisation, Sheard adds. Two days ago, Chinese president Xi Jinping wowed Davos with a speech defending globalisation, at a time when Donald Trump has put free trade under threat. And now Theresa May has declared that Britain is determined to become a more powerful player after Brexit, despite the difficult negotiations ahead. 1) She seemed to give Davos what it wanted to hear, saying that the UK will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after leaving the EU I want the UK to emerge from this period of change as a truly Global Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too; a country that gets out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. 2) She threw her weight behind the growing pressure to fix globalisation to address the populist surge in politics; a major issue this year. May, though, took an almost moral tone, speaking about how the responsibilities we have to one another have been forgotten. This was the key line: But just as we need to act to address the deeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years, so we also need to recognise the way in which a more global and individualistic world can sometimes loosen the ties that bind our society together, leaving some people feeling locked out and left behind. 3) She was interventionist, highlighting her industrial strategy and saying: For government, it means not just stepping back and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the prevailing orthodoxy in many countries has argued for so many years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just getting out of the way. Not just leaving businesses to get on with the job and assuming that problems will just fix themselves. It means stepping up to a new, active role that backs businesses and ensures more people in all corners of the country share in the benefits of its success. 4) And she criticised business leaders too, especially those multinationals who can seem to play by different rules. Theresa May ended her speech with a call on global leaders and business chiefs to work together to make globalisation work for everyone. As we build a new, bold, confident Global Britain and shape a new era of globalisation that genuinely works for all As we harness the forces of globalisation so that the system works for everyone, and so maintain public support for that system for generations to come. I want that to be the legacy of our time. To use this moment to provide responsive, responsible leadership that will bring the benefits of free trade to every corner of the world; that will lift millions more out of poverty and towards prosperity; and that will deliver security, prosperity and belonging for all of our people. May returns to the downsides of globalisation - and the damage it has done to societies. Too often today, the obligations we have to each other have been forgotten, she says. We need to recognise how a more global and individualistic world can loosen the ties that bind us together. And May stakes her flag firmly, declaring: I am determined that centre-ground mainstream politics can respond to the concerns people have today. That means standing up for free trade and globalisation, but also ensuring it works for everyone. And she quotes Edmund Burke, who wrote: A state without the means for some change is without the means for its own conservation. May insists that governments have an obligation to help those who need help the most. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just getting by, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a government that gets out of the way - you want one that will help you. Government and business need to do even more to make the case for globalisation, May continues. She cites her new industrial strategy -- a term that had fallen into disrepute in recent years. But Britain is going to create the conditions where winners can grow and thrive, not about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpicking winners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We must step up and take control to make sure that free trade and globalisation works for everyone. May now addresses the UK business leaders in the audience - saying they must do more to help the public. She cites the importance of everyone paying a fair share of tax. In the UK, trust with business runs at just 35% among the lowest-income groups. Companies must putting aside short-term considerations, and investing in people and communities for the long term. There is a feeling that some companies, especially multinationals, are playing by a different set of rules to everyone else, May declares. It is essential for business to show leadership - to show that in this globalised world, everyone is playing by the same rules. On globalisation, May reiterates that some people are being left behind by economic changes - they are getting by but not getting on. On slavery, May urges her audience to help tackle this abhorent problem; she has convened a top-level panel at Davos today to seek solutions. May reminds the audience of the dark days in the first half of the 20th century. We must uphold the institutions that help the world to work together, and guarantee global security. May also cites Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multicultural heritage. May is outlining her vision of making Britain a truly global country. We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again. A country in charge of its own destiny is in a better position to take the lead in improving the world, she continues. She cites the fact that some of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous car brands, like Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tata. Brexit was a vote to take control, and make decisions ourselves, May continues. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history and culture is profoundly international, she says. We have always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We are, by instinct, a great global trading nation. And we want to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world. She welcomes the fact that preliminary talks are underway with several countries including Australia, while China and the Gulf States have expressed interest in making deals with us. Britain faces a time of momentous change, and tough negotiations, May says, following the Brexit vote. But we must believe that it will lead to a better future British people chose to build a truly global country, May says. And we face the future with confidence. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the stage now. This is an organisation that is committed to improving the state of the world. Those of us who meet here are optimists, who believe in the power of public and private collaboration to make the world tomorrow better than today. Free trade, partnership and globalisation. But outside this hall, those forces for good which we take for granted are being called into question. Forces that have had such a positive impact, lifting millions out of poverty, broken down barriers and raised living standards, are now being undermined. As we meet here, across Europe parties of the far left and far right are trying to profit from a keenly felt sense, especially among those on modest incomes, that these forces are not working for them. These people feel that mainstream political and business leaders have failed to appreciate their legitimate concerns for too long, May says. But she will lay out an agenda for how mainstream politics can address this. Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder Klaus Schwab has taken the stage, to introduce Theresa May. Schwab says he was born before world war 2 broke out - for him, Europe was a big dream of never having war again, and feeling united. He says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very pleased to hear Theresa May say that the UK will not leave Europe, but will have a very amicable divorce. Hammond and Khan are now chatting together, as we wait for the PM... Chancellor Philip Hammond just marched into the hall, not far behind Sadiq Khan. Even the global elite have to queue sometimes. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a massive line snaking around the conference now, as delegates try to bag a decent seat to watch Theresa May in 25 minutes. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of activity as some of the global elite head into a private meeting in the heart of the WEF conference centre. It looks like an IGWEL - or Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders in the Davos jargon. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and HSBC chairman Douglas Flint arriving (you can see Lagarde here) One insider says they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing sustainable development; hopefully they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still catch Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech too. London mayor Sadiq Khan is also in Davos today. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been meeting with business leaders, and arguing for Britain to get privileged access to the single market. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just giving an interview to the BBC now, saying that his message to EU leaders is not to assume the Brexit vote was a one-off. Unless you address the concerns around globalisation, unless you address these issues, if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vote in your country whether to stay or leave the EU don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if your voters decide to leave the EU. Good morning from Davos, and day three of the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting. Theresa May swept into the Belv\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a8re hotel in the centre of this ski resort last night, on the latest stage in her push for Brexit. The UK PM is the hottest act in town today; at 10.15am local time (9.15am GMT) she will deliver a special address to an audience of fellow world leaders, business chiefs and economists. The speech gets top billing: Britain after Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will spell out the economic implications of leaving the European Union May is expected to talk about those who have not prospered under globalisation; linking the Brexit vote into a broader theme that has dominated talk at Davos this week already. One Downing Street source told Sky News overnight that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The PM is reflecting themes she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spoken about before - that change has to come in order to benefit who have been left behind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to use the speech to pitch for more global trade, saying Britain remains open to business despite voting to leave the EU. The speech could also include a hard-hitting section on modern slavery; a priority for May since her days as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Home Secretary. May is also meeting bank chiefs in Davos, such as Wall Street bosses who are wondering whether to start moving jobs and operations out of the City in anticipation of the UK leaving the single market. Bloomberg: May Meets Wall Streeters in Davos as Banks Plan Brexit Exodus It could be a tricky Davos debut for May; the Guardian reports this morning that European leaders are presenting a united front ahead of the EU exit talks.

As ergonomics gurus have since pointed out, its significant backward tilt means your back is naturally pushed against the flat surface of the back, allowing the spine to decompress and encouraging the shoulders, rib cage and pelvis to open up. Rietveld thought of his chairs as a kind of equipment, a means of physically \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toning up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bodies that were neglected during the working day. Remember his mantra: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zitten\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (to sit) is an active not a passive verb.

As cultural commentator Aline Saarinen (wife of organic modernist architect, Eero) noted in the 1950s, they were at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the peak of chic around 1900\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but had fallen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the gutter of derision around 1920 to 1930\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Andy Warhol had a huge Tiffany lamp in his New York apartment, as part of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Victorian surrealist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interior decor, prompting Saarinen to comment that they are for people who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like what is out of favour for perversity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Consisting of four robust turned legs and a simple top, connected by 16 mortise and tenon joints, it was the everyday, all-purpose stool, often used around a dining table, under which they could be tucked when not in use. It is a favourite of V&amp;A furniture curator Nick Humphrey, who describes it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a 400-year-old workhorse: a stool, a table, something to stand on to reach a shelf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often used to rest coffins on. It is a simple witness to life and death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jacobean antique version: \u00c2\u00a315,000 Get scouring your local junk shops and you may well find a bargain, otherwise you can pick up replicas online for around \u00c2\u00a375. 5 Fornasetti cabinet by Piero Fornasetti /Gio Ponti, 1951 A chunk of Renaissance cityscape compressed into a cabinet, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trumeau Architettura\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (or architectural cabinet) was a collaboration between Italian surrealist artist Piero Fornasetti and designer Gio Ponti, first shown at the 1951 Milan Triennale. Inspired by 16th-century Italian mannerist art, its doors open to reveal classical colonnades disappearing into the distance, while images of vaulted undercrofts extend below. Lithographs were created for each section, printed on to transfer sheets, and then applied to fibreboard panels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you could create your own by printing out a picture of your favourite building and doing a bit of DIY decoupage on your Ikea cupboard, right?

Or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spotted a nice dining table, but it would be better if it was a bit longer? Young east London start-up company Opendesk have invented an ingenious online platform for open-source furniture designs that can be customised, downloaded and made locally, anywhere in the world, cutting out the middle-man supplier and reducing waste, transport and storage costs.

He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar.</p> <p>Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. </p> <p>A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut regulations by 75%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut taxes massively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the middle class while imposing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very major border tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767. The 20,000 level, within tantalising reach just a couple of weeks ago, is receding fast.</p> <p>Meanwhile the pound is up 0.8% against a weakening dollar at $1.2476, still at a five week high. The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

The consultancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Higgins said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Admittedly, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range.</p> <p>We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270.</p> <p>Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders at the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders at the New York Stock Exchange</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level.</p> <p>As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period.</p> <p>Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high.</p> <p>Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862c63e4b0b7484e0a3025\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T16:19:00.233Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president.</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room.</p> <p>Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years.</p> <p>If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities.

Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017.</p> <p>Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862117e4b0dd6f5509d3b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T15:34:03.171Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms.<em> </em>Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties.</p> <p>January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter.

The reason will be that parliament will have much more to say in triggering Article 50 and most importantly, it fades the chances of Scotland prompting another referendum. Scotland can no longer play the card that the Brexit is against their will if the vote comes to the parliament. As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index.</p> <p>On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling.

                "bodyText":"Investors were cautious as Donald Trump made a number of moves in his first day in office as US president, including plans to renegotiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar. Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut regulations by 75%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut taxes massively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the middle class while imposing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very major border tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767. The 20,000 level, within tantalising reach just a couple of weeks ago, is receding fast. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.8% against a weakening dollar at $1.2476, still at a five week high. The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The weakness in the dollar and hopes that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure plans will boost demand are helping to buoy up metal prices, with copper up 0.8% on the London Metal Exchange. In turn that has lifted mining groups, with Antofagasta rising up nearly 4% and Anglo American adding 1.5%. Precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo are also in demand as investors seek havens amid the uncertainty over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. The US is set to renogiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, and our latest report is here: US markets could be set for further falls as the initial Trump boost fades and a possible recession looms, reckons Capital Economics. The consultancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Higgins said: We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse. Admittedly, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range. We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270. Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period. Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high. Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side. On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years. If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities. Given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 45 day low for the dollar index, it seems the Trump boost seems to have run its course, for now. The Dow is currently down 75 points or 0.38%. Still with the confidence figures, ING economist Bert Colijn said: Improvements in the job market seem to be outweighing concerns about political volatility among consumers for the moment. Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017. Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic. The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said: First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months. Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote last June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. Over in Europe, consumer confidence improved in January to a 21 month high, but not by as much as expected. According to the European Commission, consumer confidence in the eurozone rose by 0.2 points to -4.9, compared to expectations of a figure of -4.8. In the wider European Union it improved 0.3 points to -4.3 from December. With the concerns about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist strategy heightened by the new President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration speech hitting the dollar and prompting investors to seek havens, US markets have edged lower at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 13 points or 0.06% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.145. Meanwhile Trump has been telling a number of US chief executives that companies will get fast approval to build in the US, but those that move abroad will face major border taxes on goods coming into the US. The UK Supreme Court is due to make its decision on Tuesday on whether MPs are entitled to have a vote on triggering Article 50, the process of leaving the EU. Whichever way the ruling goes, the pound and the markets are bound to be affected. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, both FTSE and sterling are the major focus for investors. If the Supreme court provides a decision which is against the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unilateral power (triggering the article 50), we could see sterling moving higher. The reason will be that parliament will have much more to say in triggering Article 50 and most importantly, it fades the chances of Scotland prompting another referendum. Scotland can no longer play the card that the Brexit is against their will if the vote comes to the parliament. As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index. On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling. Traders will perceive that Theresa May is going to achieve her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit without major hurdles. For the FTSE 100, lower sterling has provided ammunition for higher moves. Time for a quick catch-up, and the latest reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments. Worries over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early moves as president are driving the markets today, weakening the US dollar as investors fret about a new wave of protectionism. The pound has hit its highest level since mid-December, currently up almost one cent at $1.246. The euro has also crept higher, to $1.0735, as the US currency fell on the FX markets. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga blames uncertainty for the moves. Global stocks traded lower on Monday as the Trump fueled uncertainties, rising political risks, and overall market jitters dented investors risk appetite. Asian shares failed to maintain gains while the risk-off sentiment sent European markets into the red territory. Fears that the new US president could spark trade wars with China, or with countries close to home, have dominated today. These concerns got another bump after US media reported that Trump will sign an executive order today to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. Analysts at Dutch bank ING explain why traders are edgy: While President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo strong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dollar comment and combative inaugural address has taken some of the steam out of the greenback\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, we remain wary that dollar strength could be the ultimate by-product of the new President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy stance. Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration. With a US economy already close to full employment, it is difficult not to see Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans generating sufficient inflationary pressures to drive US yields and the dollar higher. But equally, investors are placing greater focus on future US trade and foreign policy. Naturally the market may be bracing itself for President Trump to formally name China a currency manipulator. In practice, this would spark bilateral negotiations rather than any immediate tariffs but presumably the market wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take too kindly to this. That has weighed on the London stock market; the FTSE 100 is currently down 42 points at 7156, meaning its early 2017 gains have been wiped out. The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new year optimism has rather fizzled out, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having hit a fresh all-time high this time last Monday, an aggressively negative series of sessions last week, largely inspired by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains following Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit speeches, has effectively wiped away the remarkable gains it managed in the first fortnight of 2017. The FTSE still has a way to go before it dips under the key 7000 level; however, the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rampant optimism does seem to have come to an end in conjunction with the pound beginning to peek its head above the parapet after a month or so of suffering. Trump anxiety, and the weak dollar, also helped to push the gold price up to a two-month high, as part of a general move to safer assets. US media are reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that would start the process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (the free trade bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico). This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come as a shock to those paying attention to the US election, as Paul McNamara of investment group GAM points out: Meanwhile in Europe, protesting farmers have been spraying powdered milk at the EU council headquarters in Brussels. The demonstration, organised by the European Milk Board, is meant to put pressure on ministers to help support milk powder prices. According to news service Agriland, the farmers want the EU to agree not to release stocks from the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk powder mountain. That would allow them to cut production and push up prices. The EMB says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dairy market is still stuck in a crisis. Voluntary production cuts might have led to a rise in prices, but the sale of milk powder from EU intervention stocks would, once again, put the market under pressure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a permanent crisis instrument that prevents surpluses on the dairy market and leads to long-term stability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the board. AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marine Laouchez of AFP filmed a videoclip of the protests: Newsflash: Mario Draghi is now collecting the 2016 Camillo Cavour prize, awarded for his work strengthening Italy. And the ECB president is talking about the instability currently in play in Italy and beyond, as he compares the situation today to the mid-19th century, when Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, helped unify Italy. His speech is on the ECB website, in Italian -- here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Google Translate makes of it.... Cavour acted in a European context suddenly destabilized by the 1848 revolutions that had disrupted the balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna after the fall of Napoleon. It was a period of turbulent transition, in which for the protagonists of European politics opened large joint opportunities to large risks. Today we are again in a historical phase in which Europe is moving, after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, the reunification of Germany, the effects of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the UK via exit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc European Union, the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. In different words, now as then we could say that it is looking for a new stability. ECB president Mario Draghi has just been sighted in Turin, where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be giving a speech at a prize-giving ceremony (in memory of Italian statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll watch out for any monetary policy signals from Draghi (who left interest rates unchanged last week) The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total national debt has shrunk to its smallest level in four years, when measured against its total economy. New figures from Eurostat show that the euro area national debt dropped to 90.1% of GDP in the July-September 2016 quarter, almost a whole percentage point lower than the previous three months. That means that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been growing at a slightly faster rate than its borrowing has expanded: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the FTSE 100 has lost virtually all the gains it made this year. The rally that began after the shock US election result in early November appears to have petered out, as investors face the reality of a Trump presidency. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there is a gloomy mood in the markets, with the FTSE 100 currently down 41 points at 7156. The week has started on a bearish note, with the FTSE 100 falling over 40 points in early trading. The index has lost around 3% since its peak earlier in January, although it has held the breakout line of 7130 that marked its previous high. The steady deterioration in risk appetite over the past few days nicely bookends the post-election period, which began with such furious buying of stocks. Disappointment has set in, but it has not yet turned to disillusionment. This chart, from the Wall Street Journal, show how market volatility has risen while money flowed out of the markets last week: City investors are disappointed that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration speech contained little detail on fiscal policy, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. As Kit Juckes of French Bank Societe Generale puts it: Instead, the message was combative, protectionist and isolationist, while the media focus was on the size of crowds and the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movement marches in the US and elsewhere. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our take on Crowdgate: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has opened in the red. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 64 points, or 0.9%, to 7134 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the strength of the pound (which will hurt exporters, and make UK shares more expensive for foreign investors to buy). Financial stocks are leading the selloff, with Admiral Group down 2.5%, RBS down 2.2% and Barclays losing 2%. Other European markets are also falling, with anxiety over Trump to the fore. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the markets are being driven by the weaker dollar this morning. So far the new president has stoked protectionism but offered little detail on the good stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pro-growth infrastructure spending, stimulus etc. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ensuring the dollar starts the week on the back foot, trading at its weakest since early December. Gold is trading at a two-month high as safe haven assets are bid. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking for more details on spending and growth plans in the coming days, which could revive the long dollar trade. The dollar is down 0.5% against other currencies this morning. RBC Capital Markets blame: ...the lack of economic policy detail in President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration speech coupled with concerns over his potential protectionist stance. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist rhetoric is driving down the US dollar this morning. The greenback is in retreat against most major currencies, sending the British pound up 0.75 of a cent to $1.245. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since 19 December. Ilya Spivak of Daily FX reports that traders are anxious, piling into US debt and the Japanese yen, and gold of course. The euro is also gaining ground, up 0.35% at $1.074 this morning. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpopularity, unpredictability and unyielding determination to put US interests first are all worrying for traders, who have the unenviable task of trying to guess his next move. Kathleen Brooks of City Index say investors will be watching Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first week as president closely: After the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joyless rant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration speech on Friday (to paraphrase Simon Schama, writing in the FT at the weekend), the world is watching to see what will be included in the rush of executive orders that are forecast to come in the coming days. This will hopefully give us an idea if Trump has a coherent set of views that could be considered a plausible economic policy. If his team use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alternative facts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the size of the much-anticipated infrastructure spending programme, for instance, or if he walks away from rolling back years of financial market regulation, two key drivers of the stock market rally since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election in November, then the stock market rally could whither and die. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are starting the week in a nervous mood, as Donald Trump gets his feet under the Oval Office desk. Gold has hit a two-month high in early trading, with investors anxious about the new president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combative inauguration speech on Friday. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vow to put America First means more worries about protectionism, and potential trade wars. Bullion is changing hands at $1,217 per ounce, the highest since late November, in a sign that investors are looking for safe assets. Many City experts are predicting that trading will be edgy in the next few months, as Reuters explains: With the lack of a clear policy direction from Trump, the market movement is a sign that risk aversion is back on the table, OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan said. The market could witness volatility into the first 100 days of the Trump administration, he added. Shares in Europe are expected to drop too, as local currencies gain against the US dollar. Also coming up The economic calendar is a little sparse today, but there are a few things to watch out for: 11.30am GMT: ECB President Mario Draghi will deliver a speech on the occasion of the awarding of the Premio Camillo Cavour organised by Fondazione Camillo Cavour in Turin 1.15pm GMT: ECB Board Member Peter Praet delivers a speech at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European Pillar of Social Rights Conference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in Brussels 3pm: The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly Eurozone consumer confidence survey",

                "bodyText":"Starbucks has promised to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive order temporarily barring refugees access to the US and banning entry for anyone from seven majority Muslim countries. The move came as leading US companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Ford, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft came out against the policy. Howard Schultz, the coffee chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order and would be taking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resolute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd action, starting with offering jobs to refugees. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told employees in a strongly worded note. He added that the move was to make clear the company \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions grows with each passing day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Schultz said the initial focus would be in the US and for refugees who had served as interpreters for the US military, but it is not yet clear when the five-year period would begin, or whether people would be employed directly by Starbucks or by suppliers. Schultz added that the Seattle-based company had also contacted employees who had been affected by the immigration ban. The move met with both support and a backlash on social media. The hashtag #BoycottStarbucks was trending on Twitter on Monday morning, with people praising and condemning the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. Starbucks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 move came as leading banks, car companies and technology firms voiced concern at the executive order.
