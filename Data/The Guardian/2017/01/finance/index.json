But they have been quick to point out the divergence between the PMI survey and official data which paints a gloomier picture of the factory sector and many also highlight the threat that higher inflation in 2017 will squeeze consumer spending, the biggest driver of economic growth in the UK.<br></p> <p>The outlook remains one of a marked slowdown for the UK economy this year, says James Knightley, senior economist at the bank ING.</p> <p>He commented:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This [the PMI reading] is the strongest figure since June 2014 and again suggests that the Brexit referendum has not harmed the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector. In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound against other major currencies has boosted the UK\u2019s competitiveness on the international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export orders performing well.</p> <p>However, sterling\u2019s fall also means that imported components are more expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 2017 from 2.2% in 2016.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586b7e3fe4b0a43edaa20bd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-03T10:36:46.064Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland</strong>, <em>reports Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent.</em></p> <p>The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the \u2018British Irish Gateway to Trade\u2019 service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea.</p> <p>Britain remains Ireland\u2019s biggest trading partner with business between the UK and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.

A rise in overall new orders to a two-and-a-half year high suggests that the strength in manufacturing activity will continue in the coming months. Admittedly, the fall in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures. Indeed, despite falling back from 79.1 in November to 76.9 in December, the input prices balance remained well above its long-run average (55.1).</p> <p>Nonetheless, on the basis of past form, the three-month average of the survey\u2019s output balance is consistent with a quarterly rise in manufacturing output of about 1% in Q4, following Q3\u2019s 0.8% contraction. This is consistent with other survey evidence, such as the CBI\u2019s Industrial Trends Survey, which suggest that the manufacturing sector gained some momentum at the end of 2016 too. </p> <p>That said, given the sharp monthly fall in October in the official figures, even a large increase in output in November and December would probably not be enough to lead to a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q4. A stronger end to the quarter would, however, provide a good base for manufacturing growth in Q1.

He says that income growth is unlikely to keep up with rising inflation, caused by the sharp slide in the pound which is pushing up the price of imported raw materials and other goods.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK economy retained its momentum last year, despite the seismic shock of the vote to leave the EU. Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth averaged 0.5% in the first three quarters of 2016, matching 2015\u2019s rate and the average pace of growth across the Atlantic. So far, surveys and official data point to growth of about 0.4% in Q4.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 is still trading 0.6% higher at 7,188.41, up 45.52 points, leaving it on track for another record close. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is eyeing the 20,000 level \u2013 it\u2019s currently 0.67% ahead at 19,895.87. Crude oil prices are up more than 2% as production cuts kick in. The main economic news today was a strong UK manufacturing survey, a bigger-than-expected drop in German unemployment and a pick-up in inflation in Germany and France \u2013 all taking economists by surprise. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Inflation in Germany unexpectedly jumped to the highest level in three and a half years, official data showed today. The annual rate rose to 1.7% in December, the highest since July 2013, and compared with 0.7% the month before. The increase which comes alongside a pick-up in inflation in France and Spain provides ammunition for those at the European Central Bank who are arguing for a gradual exit from the bank\u2019s unconventional stimulus programme. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is up more than 150 points, or 0.8%, at 19,915.73 at the open, flirting with the 20,000 mark. The Nasdaq is more than 40 points ahead at 5,424.16 while the S&amp;P 500 is some 17 points higher at 2,255.81, both gains of nearly 0.8%. UK grocery prices rose slightly between November and December, but prices remained below 2015 due to competition among supermarkets, according to data from price tracking website mysupermarket.com. A shopping basket of 35 commonly bought items cost \u00a383.33 in December, up from \u00a383.18 in November. Fresh fruit and veg cost more such as bananas, grapes and carrots. But the basket was still nearly 3% cheaper than it was in December 2015, as fierce competition between supermarkets limited their ability to raise prices. Economists and retail experts expect food inflation to rise this year because the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote is pushing up the cost of imported goods. The tracker covers nearly 5,000 products across Tesco, Asda, Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s, Ocado, Lidl and Morrisons. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Importantly, the delay means that the Trump administration, which has in the past suggested it wants to relax banking regulation, will now be involved in signing off the new proposals. The proposals are already contentious, but whether they will be weakened remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the retail sector has an early dose of the January blues, he noted, with Next, Dixons Carphone and Marks &amp; Spencer the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today. Halfords is still the biggest loser in the FTSE 350 index. Those with substantial import costs have been hit particularly hard, after Deutsche Bank flagged the potential for lower sterling to lead to higher inflation in a research note released this morning. With the note highlighting the difficulties a weak pound could bring to Halfords\u2019 already increasing cost base, shares in the UK\u2019s leading retailer of motoring and cycling products fell by 5.6%. Our City editor Jill Treanor writes: Global regulators have postponed a meeting to agree major reforms to the banking sector prompted by the 2008 crisis. A leading group of central bankers was due to meet on 8 January to agree changes that could have forced some banks - largely in Europe - to hold more capital. But it was announced on Tuesday that the meeting had been called off. No new date was given for the meeting of central bankers - known as the group of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS) - who were due to discuss rules that influence how much capital banks hold and the way they measure the risks they are taking. Banks are the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, led by Barclays which is up 4%, after global regulators delayed the sign off of new rules on bank capitalisation. Lloyds Banking Group is 3.6% ahead while Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 3.3%, Standard Chartered 2.4% and HSBC is up 2%. Mining shares, which have been among the big winners of the weak pound in the past year, are also among the biggest gainers, including Antofagasta and Glencore. Oil prices have been rising as new production cuts take effect, as reported earlier. This is feeding through to petrol prices. UK drivers are paying 15p a litre \u2013 or \u00a38.25 a tank \u2013 more for their fuel than a year ago, according to the AA. Petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared to 102.69p at the same time last year, a price last seen in December 2014. Diesel has risen to 120.35p from 105.99p 12 months ago. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 2015. All in all, with the cold weather, it\u2019s been a pretty miserable return to work. UK workers\u2019 confidence has not been shaken by uncertainty around leaving the European Union, with 48% saying that they are looking for a new job this year, according to specialist recruiter Reed. It asked more than 2,000 people about their careers in 2017, and found that 43% are feeling optimistic about their career prospects. The FTSE 100 has hit fresh all-time highs on the first trading day of the year in London, building on its record close at the end of 2016. It rose through the 7,200 mark earlier to a new record of 7,205.21 and is now more than 30 points ahead at 7,176.20, a 0.5% gain. The leading index is on track for another record close if it holds on to its gains. Retailers are among the biggest fallers, led by Next, which was downgraded by Deutsche Bank ahead of a Christmas trading update tomorrow. Dixons Carphone, Marks &amp; Spencer and Kingfisher are also down. European bourses are also ahead. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.04% at 11,602.96 France\u2019s CAC up 0.5% at 4,906.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.4% at 9,460.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.7% at 19,703.28 Britain\u2019s factories are booming, according to the latest manufacturing PMI survey from Markit/CIPS. This drove the pound to a two-week high against the euro. Oil prices reached 18-month highs this morning as production cuts kick in. Brent crude touched $58.37 a barrel earlier and is now up 2.1% at $58.02. As speculation continues over where banks based in London and elsewhere in the UK might choose to settle after Brexit, we hear today from the boss of American bank JP Morgan. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, has been speaking about his hopes for the investment bank\u2019s UK operations once Brexit becomes a reality to Financial News. Dimon said he worries Brexit will have repercussions for the rest of the European Union. \u201cA major fear to me about Brexit is that it causes the EU to fail down the road,\u201d he told Financial News in the interview at JP Morgan\u2019s Victoria Embankment offices in London. Financial News says Dimon also proclaimed a \u201clove\u201d for London, but provided no reassurance that JP Morgan wouldn\u2019t move business from the City to the continent after Brexit takes effect. \u201cI wish we could keep it all here [in London],\u201d said Dimon. \u201cI think it\u2019s very good for Europe.\u201d The full interview is available here. Ahead of the June referendum, JP Morgan was among the big banks warning that a vote to leave would cost jobs. It said 4,000 jobs could go. The FTSE 100 has not managed to hold on to all its earlier gains, when it pushed through the 7,200 mark, but still looks on track for another record close. The index of London-listed bluechips is currently up 31 points at 7,174, having closed at an all-time high of 7,142.83 on Friday, the last trading day of 2016. The futures market is also pointing to a strong start to 2017 for Wall Street. Much of the support for the FTSE has come from the weak pound, which is down sharply since last June\u2019s Brexit vote. The weak pound flatters the earnings of those FTSE 100 companies that report in dollars. It has also helped those firms who export from Britain and it makes assets priced in pounds more attractive to foreign investors. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex expects the FTSE 100 to remain in positive territory in afternoon trading but said the pound\u2019s strength was limiting gains. He also expects gains on Wall Street for the Dow Jones industrial average index. Campbell commented: It appears that this morning\u2019s December manufacturing PMI reading... hampered the FTSE\u2019s record-breaking surge by giving a boost to the pound. In the aftermath of the PMI release sterling jumped 0.6% against the euro, taking it back above 1.18 for the first time in a week and a half; this was enough to temper the FTSE\u2019s growth, despite the fact that the pound is continuing to struggle against the dollar... Looking ahead to this afternoon and following a bitterly disappointing end to 2016 that saw the index fail to break 20,000 the Dow Jones is set to recover some of its losses this Tuesday. The Dow futures are suggesting the index will reclaim around 150 points, pushing it above 19900 and putting that elusive landmark level back on the cards. The upbeat PMI report on the UK\u2019s manufacturing industry caught City analysts off guard. But they have been quick to point out the divergence between the PMI survey and official data which paints a gloomier picture of the factory sector and many also highlight the threat that higher inflation in 2017 will squeeze consumer spending, the biggest driver of economic growth in the UK. The outlook remains one of a marked slowdown for the UK economy this year, says James Knightley, senior economist at the bank ING. He commented: This [the PMI reading] is the strongest figure since June 2014 and again suggests that the Brexit referendum has not harmed the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector. In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound against other major currencies has boosted the UK\u2019s competitiveness on the international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export orders performing well. However, sterling\u2019s fall also means that imported components are more expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 2017 from 2.2% in 2016. A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland, reports Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the \u2018British Irish Gateway to Trade\u2019 service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea. Britain remains Ireland\u2019s biggest trading partner with business between the UK and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce. Its chairman John McGrane said the network would promote more growth in trade between Ireland and the UK in the face of the Brexit challenge. McGrane said: At a time when businesses are preparing for Brexit, they appreciate a resource like BIG which helps them to grow their business by being introduced to more customers and suppliers across the UK and Ireland\u201d. 2017 will focus all our minds on the importance of the trade between Britain and Ireland which supports over 400,000 jobs. Firms on both sides of the Irish Sea are looking for more trading opportunities and this new service supports the work of Chambers and the various state agencies to make those connections easier to find for businesses north south east and west. The new service lets businesses find the trading partners they want within a trusted network of like-minded firms across the two islands. The full story: More reaction to the strong UK manufacturing PMI. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doesn\u2019t believe it will last. UK manufacturing is benefiting from both continued brisk growth in domestic demand as well as improving global demand, but this momentum likely will peter out in 2017. The pick-up in the total orders balance to 58.5 from 55.2 suggests manufacturing output will continue to grow briskly over the next couple of months. Meanwhile, the fact that the UK\u2019s PMI exceeds those for the eurozone and U.S., 54.9 and 54.2 respectively, signals that the UK economy is continuing to marginally outperform. The relationship between the PMI and the official data, however, has been particularly loose lately; the PMI has signalled steady growth in manufacturing output since August, but the official data have oscillated around a flat trend. Meanwhile, we continue to think that domestic demand for manufactured goods will crumble as consumers experience a renewed squeeze on their real incomes, driven mainly by higher import prices. At the same time, the boost to growth from sterling\u2019s depreciation will remain relatively modest, because exporters have raised sterling prices sharply and because uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trade relationships will deter exporters from investing. Oil prices have pushed even higher, to 18-month highs, boosted by hopes that a deal to cut production between Opec and non-Opec producers such as Russia will diminish the global oil glut. Brent crude jumped about 2.5% to $58.37 a barrel, the highest since July 2015. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: December\u2019s UK Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI provides further evidence that the sector\u2019s post-referendum weakness will prove short-lived... A rise in overall new orders to a two-and-a-half year high suggests that the strength in manufacturing activity will continue in the coming months. Admittedly, the fall in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures. Indeed, despite falling back from 79.1 in November to 76.9 in December, the input prices balance remained well above its long-run average (55.1). Nonetheless, on the basis of past form, the three-month average of the survey\u2019s output balance is consistent with a quarterly rise in manufacturing output of about 1% in Q4, following Q3\u2019s 0.8% contraction. This is consistent with other survey evidence, such as the CBI\u2019s Industrial Trends Survey, which suggest that the manufacturing sector gained some momentum at the end of 2016 too. That said, given the sharp monthly fall in October in the official figures, even a large increase in output in November and December would probably not be enough to lead to a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q4. A stronger end to the quarter would, however, provide a good base for manufacturing growth in Q1. As such, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced in the quarters ahead. Sterling jumped to a two-week high against the euro after the strong manufacturing survey. It hit 84.71p per euro, up 0.5%. Against the dollar, the pound rose to $1.2290. The FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.8% earlier this morning, is only 0.4% ahead now at 7173.12, a gain of some 30 points. All the main sub-indices were strong. New export business rose for the seventh month in December. Companies secured new orders from the US, Europe, China, the Middle East, India and other Asian markets. Employment rose for the fifth month in December, with the pace of jobs growth picking up to the fastest in 14 months, especially at smaller and medium-sized firms. Rates of inflation for input costs and prices charged both remained among the fastest seen during the survey\u2019s history, but slowed from October\u2019s highs. UK factories ended 2016 on a strong note, according to the Markit/CIPS manufacturing survey. The December reading of 56.1, a 30-month high, is up from 53.6 in November and well above its long-run average of 51.5. Rising domestic and overseas demand has boosted output and companies\u2019 order books. Price pressures remained elevated but eased from recent highs. The UK manufacturing PMI has hit the highest level since June 2014, rising to 56.1 \u2013 better than expected. Oil prices are pushing higher this morning, helping underpin gains in the FTSE 100. Brent crude is up 82 cents, or 1.4%, at $57.64, not far below the 2016 high of $57.89, hit on 12 December. US light crude is trading 72 cents higher at $54.44, a 1.3% gain. 1 January marked the official start of a recently agreed deal between the oil cartel Opec and other exporters such as Russia to reduce output by almost 1.8m barrels a day. Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, told Reuters: First signals suggest the Opec and non-Opec production cuts are raising hops that the global oil oversupply will diminish. The number of unemployed people in Germany has fallen for a third month in a row, declining by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 in December from the previous month to 2.638 million. Economists had expected a drop of 5,000. Germany\u2019s Federal Statistics Office also said that the jobless rate was unchanged at 6%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990. 2016 was a good year for vinyl, when sales reached a 25-year high, as LPs continue their comeback. Hannah Ellis-Petersen writes: More than 3.2m LPs were sold last year, a rise of 53% on last year and the highest number since 1991 when Simply Red\u2019s Stars was the bestselling album. This was also the first year that spending on vinyl outstripped that spent on digital downloads. The deaths of some music world giants was a key driver in vinyl sales, as people invested in records as a mementos. After David Bowie\u2019s death he became the bestselling vinyl artist of 2016, with five albums posthumously featuring in the top 30. We have published our share tips for 2017, including Tesco, Diageo, Dairy Crest, Flybe and Shire. Last year our tips didn\u2019t do so well, alas. Looking back at 2016, our markets reporter Nick Fletcher writes: It\u2019s a cliche \u2013 and true enough \u2013 that stock markets hate uncertainty, which is one possible explanation for why investors shrugged off the shock of Brexit and the even bigger shock of a Donald Trump presidency. At least there was an element of knowing where we stood, in the near term at least. In a volatile 12 months, the FTSE 100 slumped to three-and-a-half-year lows in February on fears of a global economic slowdown, recovered, then fell sharply but briefly following the EU referendum vote, before hitting new heights as a drop in the pound boosted the index\u2019s overseas earners and a rise in oil prices lifted commodity companies. It finally ended the year at a record 7,142, up 14.4%. The manufacturing PMI for Japan has come in weak, suggesting factory activity is shrinking at a faster rate. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has sent us his thoughts. Continuing the push it saw at the very end of 2016 the UK index is already eyeing the 7200 mark, a 50 point-plus rise leaving it within striking distance of that landmark level. For now, at least, investors are ignoring the potentially disruptive events littered across 2017 \u2013 most pertinent to the FTSE being March\u2019s triggering of Article 50 and the impending announcements related to the banking sector\u2019s decision whether or not to stay in the UK post-Brexit \u2013 to get behind the UK index. Helping the FTSE is the performance of Brent crude which, at just above $57 per barrel, is at its best price in around 18 months, something that has secured some solid growth in the commodity sector as the New Year gets underway. The FTSE does, however, get its first 2017-test this morning in the form of December\u2019s manufacturing PMI; analysts are expecting the figure to dip slightly month-on-month, from 53.4 to 53.3. Any negative news will likely be absorbed by the pound, which is sitting flat just above a 2-month, sub $1.23 low against the dollar. Shares in London continue to climb on the first trading day of the year, pushing the FTSE 100 up briefly to 7,202.44, a fresh record high. It is now 0.8% ahead, not far below the 7,200 mark. Mining stocks Glencore and Anglo American, which have benefited hugely from the weak pound in the past year, are among the biggest risers today, as is Intercontinental Hotels, after a rating upgrade from Barclays. Retailer Next is the biggest faller, down 3.2%, after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d. European equity markets are also up for a second day. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has risen 0.75% to 365.89, the highest level since December 2015. Italian banks are among the top gainers, with the newly-merged Banco BPM gaining 4.6% in early trading. Economists at Daiwa said: With Spanish inflation on the EU harmonised measure released last Friday surprising notably on the upside, rising 0.9ppt to 1.4% year-on-year, a near-3\u00bd-year high, the equivalent flash euro area figure due tomorrow is expected to rise 0.4ppt to 1.0%Y/Y, which would be the highest in since September 2013. Nevertheless, given the continued lack of underlying cost pressures, euro area core CPI is expected to be unchanged at just 0.8%Y/Y, for the fifth consecutive month. In the eurozone, the focus today is on the flash estimates of December inflation figures from Germany and France as well as German unemployment data. The French numbers are already out \u2013 inflation rose at an annual rate of 0.8% last month, the highest since May 2014, driven by higher food and energy prices while services inflation slipped back. The German data are expected to show an annual inflation rate of 1.3%, which would be the strongest since 2013. We are also getting German unemployment data this morning. Economists are forecasting a small fall of 5,000 in the number of jobless people, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 6%. European stock markets have also opened higher. The Dax in Frankfurt and the Ibex in Madrid are both 0.3% ahead while the CAC in Paris and the FTSE MiB in Milan have gained 0.5%. The FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the open, rising more than 27 points to 7170.65, a 0.4% rise. On the corporate front, the London Stock Exchange is selling its 50% stake in the French clearing arm of LCH Clearnet to Euronext, which runs several European exchanges, in a \u20ac510m (\u00a3433m) deal. Both companies have agreed on the terms of Euronext\u2019s all-cash offer. The LSE is offloading its stake in LCH in an attempt to ward off anti-trust concerns raised by the European commission over its proposed \u00a321bn mega-merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the operator of the German stock exchange. Read the full story here. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes that slowing growth in real incomes (adjusted for inflation) will define the UK economy this year. He says that income growth is unlikely to keep up with rising inflation, caused by the sharp slide in the pound which is pushing up the price of imported raw materials and other goods. The UK economy retained its momentum last year, despite the seismic shock of the vote to leave the EU. Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth averaged 0.5% in the first three quarters of 2016, matching 2015\u2019s rate and the average pace of growth across the Atlantic. So far, surveys and official data point to growth of about 0.4% in Q4. The economy\u2019s strength, however, has relied on consumers, who will not be able to raise spending much further in 2017 as the consequences of the Brexit vote unfold... The jobs data already have begun to lose their shine; employment fell by 6K in the three months to October, the first decline since mid-2015. The numbers often are erratic, but the deterioration in surveys of employment intentions and a small decline in the number of vacancies points to a clear slowdown in job growth. In addition, we expect no serious increase in wage growth, which likely will remain close to 2.5% this year. Employers are responding to rising materials costs by squeezing pay; the median basic pay deal was just 1.6% in the three months to November, down from 2% in the first half of the year, according to XpertHR... Households\u2019 real incomes look set to stagnate this year, following increases of 3.6% in 2015 and 2% in 2016. Investec economist Chris Hare is expecting a slight uptick in the UK factory index today, to a healthy 53.6. It dropped unexpectedly in November to 53.4 from October\u2019s revised 54.2, the second monthly decline. Anything above 50 indicates expansion while a reading below points to contraction. He says: The decline on the month is no cause for panic though \u2013 the index still remains above levels that prevailed in the months before the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU and is also still above its long run average level. Indeed, we expect the read from the manufacturing sector to remain fairly elevated over the coming months \u2013 exporters should continue to benefit from post-referendum falls in the pound. Over time, that should more than offset the adverse effect of higher import costs. Meanwhile, we would note that businesses have largely shrugged off the economic uncertainty associated with the post-Brexit vote environment. Good morning, and Happy New Year. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The FTSE 100 ended 2016 at a record high of 7,142.83 after a surge in mining stocks and dollar earners, which dominate the index. The pound has lost 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote in June, benefiting those companies that make most of their money overseas. The UK market reopens today after yesterday\u2019s bank holiday closure \u2013 the first trading day of 2017. The highlight is the UK manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index for December, which will shed more light on how industry has fared since the referendum. European stock markets got off to a good start yesterday after strong manufacturing reports. The manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 54.9 last month, the highest since April 2011, boosted by Germany, France and Italy. German factory growth rose to close to a three-year high thanks to rising demand from Asia and the US.

Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford to increase interest rates anytime in the near future \u2013 such indicators normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole driver of the current narrative.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5874ca2ce4b0c0afac91f4ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-10T11:49:26.393Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Incidentally, the FTSE 100 could also set its longest run of daily gains since 2009 today -- as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/10/brexit-worries-pound-low-ftse-record-high-city-business-live?page=with:block-5874c143e4b0710de27b80f0#block-5874c143e4b0710de27b80f0\">the lengthiest stretch of record highs ever</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/818783575315251200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FTSE 100 set for best winning streak since 2009 <a href=\"https://t.co/h7RbYpuOtj\">https://t.co/h7RbYpuOtj</a></p>&mdash; Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/818783575315251200\">January 10, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-10T11:56:34.374Z\">at 11.56am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5874c143e4b0710de27b80f0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-10T11:40:52.433Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 on track for record-breaking run</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since it was created in 1984.</strong></p> <p>After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, an new intraday high.</p> <p>Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the last eight days running.

                "bodyText":"While the FTSE 100 was breaking new records, European markets were more subdued but still managed to end the day in positive territory, for the most part. The final scores showed: Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.17% to 11,583.30 France\u2019s Cac closed up just 0.01% at 4888.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.33% to 19,424.19 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9452.0 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 42 points or 0.2% at 19,929, heading back towards the 20,000 barrier. Meanwhile after its recent falls, the pound is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2160 and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1511. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high for the ninth day running, breaking a record which has stood for nearly 20 years. The index finished up 0.53% at a new peak of 7275.47, bettering the eight day winning streak recorded in May 1997 as Tony Blair\u2019s Labour won the general election. The FTSE 250 has closed at 18,413, also a record high. As markets continue to climb - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in positive territory and just under 60 points away from the 20,000 level - Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE 100 has again had an outstanding day, with the index gaining from the first minute to the last as it reached new all-time highs once more. The fact that we are seeing the index hit these new highs in such a fearless manner says a lot about the potential for further gains. Interestingly we have seen both [President elect] Trump and [UK prime minister} May providing positive news for the respective US and UK indices, yet for very different reasons. While Trump has boosted US stocks by setting out a positive outlook for the future, the strength of the FTSE has been largely down to the pound devaluation associated with fears over a hard Brexit outcome. Back with the markets, and the FTSE 100 is well on course to break two records - a new closing peak and the longest run of closing highs. With a winning streak of nine consecutive end-of-day peaks, this would beat the previous record set in May 1997. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the pound still at 2 month to 10 week lows (even if it did manage to shrink much of today\u2019s losses), the miners boosted by data from China [factory gate inflation] and the supermarkets led higher by Morrisons impressive Christmas performance the FTSE has plenty of support this Tuesday..[This] sees the index set to break the record for most consecutive days of new all-time closing highs, a record that has lasted for just shy of 20 years. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is giving a speech on Brexit and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering it in the politics live blog: As investors await the US reporting season to see if company results justify the heady heights the stock market has reached, leading shares have edged lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came perilously close to the elusive 20,000 barrier on Friday, has shied further away from that level. It is currently down 27 points or 0.13% at 19,860. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both slipped marginally at the open. Back in the markets, the pound has pulled out of today\u2019s slide and is now flat against the US dollar at $1.217. It\u2019s still down slightly against the euro though, at \u20ac1.149. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the recovery could be temporary... Monday was a bit like Deja-Vu for currency traders, and a keen reminder of how politics can play havoc with a currency. Sterling declined to its lowest level since October as political fears and the Brexit premium started to bite. The pound has managed to claw back some losses on Tuesday, but it remains at risk from a further decline in sentiment. This year\u2019s Davos will certainly be different, thanks to the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Attendees will be pondering whether populist forces will triumph in elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands this year, and president Trump\u2019s views on climate change, financial regulation and global inequality. So it\u2019s no surprise that Klaus Schwab, who created WEF decades ago, is no fan of populism. But, of course, those \u2018populist\u2019 forces are no fans of Davos either! CNBC\u2019s Matt Clinch has a good take: In a nod to this current mood, this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (WEF) is titled \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership\u201d and its official agenda describes a \u201cweakening of multiple systems\u201d that has eroded confidence and speaks of a possible \u201cdownward spiral\u201d fuelled by protectionism, populism and nativism. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as U.S. president on January 20 will overshadow the event but it\u2019s hard to see how every conference, bilateral meeting or roundtable in Davos won\u2019t include some reference to this political upheaval, which the conservative news aggregation site The Drudge Report calls the \u201cnew, new world order\u201d. Indeed, some critics have attacked the event itself as being a reason why U.S. citizens started to question globalization and contemplate the negative impacts it\u2019s had on some parts of Western nations. CNBC: The \u2018party of Davos\u2019 wakes up to the new, new world order Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Campbell and Albertina Torsoli agree that China will be one of the big issues at WEF next week. They explain: The most high-profile guest by far will be Chinese president Xi Jinping, the first sitting Chinese leader to attend the event. He\u2019s heading a larger-than-ever delegation of business executives from the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, underscoring China\u2019s determination to assume a global leadership role as other major powers are hobbled by domestic infighting. China\u2019s two richest citizens, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda Group Co. Ltd CEO Wang Jianlin, will join him and appear in solo on-stage interviews. China\u2019s deepening engagement with the world will, meanwhile, be the subject of a discussion on \u201cChina\u2019s Role for Global Prosperity,\u201d in which stock-market regulator Fang Xinghai and state-assets chief Xiao Yaqing will appear alongside Lloyds of London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale. More here: Chinese president Xi\u2019s first visit to Davos, next week, is an important opportunity to strengthen relations between China and the rest of the world, says argues WEF founder Klaus Schwab. Schwab tells the WEF press conference that Xi Jinping will attend with a set of top officials and businesspeople, at a time when its economic power is as important as ever. Since I first visited China in 1979, we have developed a very close relationship, close presence in China. We are all aware that we are now in transition to a multi-polar geo-political and geo-economic structure. China will equal the United States soon for economic power. And I foresee that President Xi will show how China will assume a responsive and responsible leadership role in global affairs. Schwab also reiterates that populism won\u2019t make the world a better place. We are living in a very complex world. All the issues are interrelated.... There are no simple answers to the challenges that we have. So what we have to do in Davos is show how complicated the situation is. Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum are getting ready for their 47th annual meeting, which begins next Monday. A lot has happened around the world since the 46th get-together, and much will have shocked the CEOs, government leaders and other heavy-hitters who trek to the ski resort each year. WEF founder Klaus Schwab and colleagues are holding a pre-meeting press conference now (it\u2019s online here). Schwab says this year\u2019s meeting must make progress towards tackling the world\u2019s problems - and argued that the rising tide of populism isn\u2019t the answer. Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned to fail. We cannot just have populist solutions. The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic approach....and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, united in one mission - improving the state of the world. Schwab also singled out the challenge created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (the new wave of automation and robotics), and pointed out that Chinese premier President Xi Jinping will address Davos for the first time. Over in Italy, two people have been arrested for allegedly hacking into the email accounts of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, former prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, and thousands of others. We don\u2019t know what information was obtained, or what it was used for, but it will only intensify the focus on cybersecurity. Reuters has the details: \u201cThere were tens of thousands of email accounts hacked, and among them were accounts belonging to bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals in the Vatican,\u201d Roberto Di Legami, director of the specialised cyber police unit that conducted the investigation, told Reuters. Police have sequestered a server in Rome containing thousands of files, but 99 percent of the data was stored in the United States, Di Legami said. The information will be shipped back in coming days but it will take some time before it can be analysed. While the FTSE 100 hits fresh highs, the pound is on track for its worst three-day run sin October. Sterling is now down 0.2% at $1.214, adding to Monday\u2019s 1% slide, and keeping it at a 10-week low against the US dollar. It\u2019s also at two-month lows against the euro, down 0.25% at \u20ac1.147. These aren\u2019t big moves, of course, but it does bring the pound rather close to its weakest level against the dollar since the alarming \u2018flash crash\u2019 of early October, which is $1.2080. This chart from City expert David Jones shows how the pound\u2019s rally in November has now unravelled: Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says the uncertainty around Brexit is overshadowing the fact that UK economic data has been better than expected. He writes: \u201cThe pound\u2019s lowly performance this week took a sharper hit, reaching fresh 10-week-lows, owing largely to dimming hopes for a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit. The key issue being the taut stance of EU over free-movement and its effect on the prospects of a single market access deal for the U.K. Selling pressure on the pound is expected to stay until further details are revealed in the coming weeks. On the bright side, the economy is still defying expectations as it continues to persist on the momentum from 2016 and a lower pound has positively affected exports. Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford to increase interest rates anytime in the near future \u2013 such indicators normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole driver of the current narrative.\u201d Incidentally, the FTSE 100 could also set its longest run of daily gains since 2009 today -- as well as the lengthiest stretch of record highs ever. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since it was created in 1984. After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, an new intraday high. Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the last eight days running. It\u2019s gained 8% since the start of December: So if the rally holds, the FTSE 100 will close at a record high for the ninth day running. This would smash the previous record set in 1997 after Tony Blair won a landslide general election victory. Mining companies are now leading the rally, helped by optimism about economic growth next year. The strong Christmas trading figures from Morrison\u2019s are pushing supermarkets shares higher too. Here\u2019s some more snippets from the parliamentary hearing on Brexit and the City, via Financial News\u2019s Lucy McNulty: Over in parliament, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has warned that thousands of City jobs could be lost if the uncertainty around Brexit doesn\u2019t ease. Xavier Rolet told the Treasury committee that LSE clients wouldn\u2019t wait for clarity about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the few thousands. But the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it\u2019s syndication, trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of thousands of jobs. They would then start migrating.\u201d (thanks to Ben Woods of the Press Association for the quotes). HSBC chairman Douglas Flint is also talking about clients\u2019 concerns about Brexit. We\u2019ll have more on this shortly... Food inflation is returning to the UK, and the weak pound is partly to blame. Research group Kantar Worldpanel has reported that grocery prices rose by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first time in just over two years that food prices have gone up. The cost of importing foodstuffs like sugar and chocolate into the UK has risen since sterling slumped against other currencies. And one of the country\u2019s largest food producers, Premier Foods, is now in talks to hike prices. It\u2019s bad news for fans of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia custard and Loyd Grossman\u2019s sauces. City AM reported overnight that Premier was talking to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda due to \u201cgrowing cost pressures from the weaker pound in the wake of the EU referendum\u201d. A spokeswoman has now confirmed that negotations are underway, saying: \u201cThe situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customer. On average we are considering rises around the midsingle digit mark.\u201d The swingometer has been a staple of British current affair since the 1950s. And analysts at HSBC have created their own version, the \u2018Brexometer\u2019 to show whether the City is expecting a hard or soft Brexit. Today\u2019s weakening pound suggests we\u2019re heading towards a rather solid exit (losing full access to the single market, and no longer subject to the free movement of people, capital, goods and services). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx predicts more sterling volatility today: The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn set to deliver a speech claiming the UK can be better off out of the EU meaning it might be another rough day for the pound. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a major speech on Europe today that will outline his vision for Britain after Brexit. Our political editor Anushka Asthana explains: Jeremy Corbyn will use his first speech of 2017 to claim that Britain can be better off outside the EU and insist that the Labour party has no principled objection to ending the free movement of European workers in the UK. Setting out his party\u2019s pitch on Brexit in the year that Theresa May will trigger article 50, the Labour leader will also reach for the language of leave campaigners by promising to deliver on a pledge to spend millions of pounds extra on the NHS every week. He will say Labour\u2019s priority in EU negotiations will remain full access to the European single market, but that his party wants \u201cmanaged migration\u201d and to repatriate powers from Brussels that would allow governments to intervene in struggling industries such as steel. Sources suggested that the economic demands were about tariff-free access to the single market, rather than membership that they argued did not exist. Karl Whelan, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin, tweets that this call for immigration control but full access to the single market seems familiar.... The Financial Times argues today that \u201cexasperation\u201d over Theresa May\u2019s lack of clarity about Brexit are doing the real damage to sterling. Traders aren\u2019t surprised that Britain is likely to leave the single market, to allow new controls on immigration, but they are uncomfortable in the dark waiting for more details. Here\u2019s a flavour: With less than three months to go before the government plans to invoke Article 50 and begin the Brexit process, there is nervousness that the government has yet to reveal a plan. \u201cThere is no clear path and a lack of substance,\u201d said Andrew Soper, head of FX options at Nomura. More here: Traders fret over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit vagueness The pound is continuing to drop. It just hit a new 10-week low of $1.2118 against the US dollar, down another half a cent this morning. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading. The index of the largest companies listed in London gained 23 points, or 0.3%, to hit 7261 points. That\u2019s partly due to the pound\u2019s weakness, which boosts the value of international companies and should help exporters. A strong performance by the supermarket sector is also helping, after Morrisons posted its best sales results in seven years. Morrison\u2019s share are up 4%, with rivals Sainsbury and Tesco close behind. On Monday night the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high for the 8th day in a row. That last happened in 1997 -- a ninth consecutive closing high today would break that record. Despite Theresa May\u2019s best efforts, the pound is under renewed pressure this morning as investors fret about Brexit. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% against the euro to \u20ac1.1466 in early trading, its lowest level since the 10th November. The pound is also a little weaker against the US dollar at $1.2137, adding to Monday\u2019s losses (when it hit a three-month low against the greenback). The PM claimed on Monday that Britain will get the best possible deal from the EU. However, her insistence that the UK can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of membership\u2019 have fuelled worries about a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit (not a term Mrs May approves of), and exit from the single market. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound was \u2018battered\u2019 on Monday. She predicts that investors will keep betting against sterling until they know the details of Brexit. We expect the pound to remain the most volatile of the G10 currencies in the coming months while we wait for the triggering of Article 50. Essentially the market is likely to re-establish shorts in GBP, after a brief respite at the end of last year, until it is quite confident that Brexit won\u2019t be \u2018hard\u2019 or disastrous for the UK economy. While Theresa May says that we can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of the EU\u2019, sterling isn\u2019t safe from the bears until we know what will replace the single market. Any potential recovery in the pound be scuppered by \u201cheightened levels of political risk\u201d, she adds. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re getting a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy this morning, with results from supermarket chain Wm Morrison and retailer Majestic Wine. The early signs are encouraging, with Morrison\u2019s posting its best sales growth since 2009 - up 2.9% over the crucial Christmas period. That suggests UK consumer confidence is holding up, although Morrison\u2019s new management team should take the credit too. Majestic says its retail outlets had their biggest ever Christmas too, with like-for-like sales up 7.5%. So, Britain hasn\u2019t lost its appetite for wine - and after 2016, who can blame us? More on all that shortly.... Also coming up today Three City chiefs will be grilled by MPs about Brexit this morning. Douglas Flint of HSBC, Elizabeth Corley of Allianz Global Investors and Xavier Rolet of the London Stock Exchange are due before the Treasury committee at 10am. And City traders will be watching to see Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 can maintain its run of record highs.",

He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u2019s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar.</p> <p>Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. </p> <p>A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u201ccut regulations by 75%\u201d, \u201ccut taxes massively\u201d for the middle class while imposing a \u201cvery major border tax\u201d. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767. The 20,000 level, within tantalising reach just a couple of weeks ago, is receding fast.</p> <p>Meanwhile the pound is up 0.8% against a weakening dollar at $1.2476, still at a five week high. The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

The consultancy\u2019s John Higgins said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Admittedly, Trump\u2019s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range.</p> <p>We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270.</p> <p>Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u201cnatural\u201d level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders at the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders at the New York Stock Exchange</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level.</p> <p>As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period.</p> <p>Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u2019s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high.</p> <p>Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862c63e4b0b7484e0a3025\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T16:19:00.233Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president.</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years.</p> <p>If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities. Given today\u2019s 45 day low for the dollar index, it seems the Trump boost seems to have run its course, for now.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Dow is currently down 75 points or 0.38%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T16:28:09.210Z\">at 4.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58862351e4b0c3a2fc6ee871\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T15:39:48.231Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still with the confidence figures, ING economist Bert Colijn said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Improvements in the job market seem to be outweighing concerns about political volatility among consumers for the moment. Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017.</p> <p>Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862117e4b0dd6f5509d3b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T15:34:03.171Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u2013 as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms.<em> </em>Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties.</p> <p>January\u2019s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725354a58d109c8694cb514edff6887475fb1721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725354a58d109c8694cb514edff6887475fb1721/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European consumer confidence improves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European consumer confidence improves</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Peter/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u2013 particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. </p> <p>Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months.</p> <p>Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union.

As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index.</p> <p>On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling.

Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration.

                "bodyText":"Investors were cautious as Donald Trump made a number of moves in his first day in office as US president, including plans to renegotiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u2019s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar. Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u201ccut regulations by 75%\u201d, \u201ccut taxes massively\u201d for the middle class while imposing a \u201cvery major border tax\u201d. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767. The 20,000 level, within tantalising reach just a couple of weeks ago, is receding fast. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.8% against a weakening dollar at $1.2476, still at a five week high. The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The weakness in the dollar and hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans will boost demand are helping to buoy up metal prices, with copper up 0.8% on the London Metal Exchange. In turn that has lifted mining groups, with Antofagasta rising up nearly 4% and Anglo American adding 1.5%. Precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo are also in demand as investors seek havens amid the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s presidency. The US is set to renogiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, and our latest report is here: US markets could be set for further falls as the initial Trump boost fades and a possible recession looms, reckons Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s John Higgins said: We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse. Admittedly, Trump\u2019s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range. We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270. Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u201cnatural\u201d level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy. What\u2019s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period. Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u2019s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high. Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side. On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president. Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room. Trump\u2019s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years. If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities. Given today\u2019s 45 day low for the dollar index, it seems the Trump boost seems to have run its course, for now. The Dow is currently down 75 points or 0.38%. Still with the confidence figures, ING economist Bert Colijn said: Improvements in the job market seem to be outweighing concerns about political volatility among consumers for the moment. Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017. Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic. The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said: First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u2013 as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties. January\u2019s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u2013 particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months. Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union. The UK\u2019s Brexit vote last June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. Over in Europe, consumer confidence improved in January to a 21 month high, but not by as much as expected. According to the European Commission, consumer confidence in the eurozone rose by 0.2 points to -4.9, compared to expectations of a figure of -4.8. In the wider European Union it improved 0.3 points to -4.3 from December. With the concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist strategy heightened by the new President\u2019s inauguration speech hitting the dollar and prompting investors to seek havens, US markets have edged lower at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 13 points or 0.06% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.145. Meanwhile Trump has been telling a number of US chief executives that companies will get fast approval to build in the US, but those that move abroad will face major border taxes on goods coming into the US. The UK Supreme Court is due to make its decision on Tuesday on whether MPs are entitled to have a vote on triggering Article 50, the process of leaving the EU. Whichever way the ruling goes, the pound and the markets are bound to be affected. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision, both FTSE and sterling are the major focus for investors. If the Supreme court provides a decision which is against the government\u2019s unilateral power (triggering the article 50), we could see sterling moving higher. The reason will be that parliament will have much more to say in triggering Article 50 and most importantly, it fades the chances of Scotland prompting another referendum. Scotland can no longer play the card that the Brexit is against their will if the vote comes to the parliament. As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index. On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling. Traders will perceive that Theresa May is going to achieve her \u201cclean\u201d Brexit without major hurdles. For the FTSE 100, lower sterling has provided ammunition for higher moves. Time for a quick catch-up, and the latest reaction to today\u2019s developments. Worries over Donald Trump\u2019s early moves as president are driving the markets today, weakening the US dollar as investors fret about a new wave of protectionism. The pound has hit its highest level since mid-December, currently up almost one cent at $1.246. The euro has also crept higher, to $1.0735, as the US currency fell on the FX markets. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga blames uncertainty for the moves. Global stocks traded lower on Monday as the Trump fueled uncertainties, rising political risks, and overall market jitters dented investors risk appetite. Asian shares failed to maintain gains while the risk-off sentiment sent European markets into the red territory. Fears that the new US president could spark trade wars with China, or with countries close to home, have dominated today. These concerns got another bump after US media reported that Trump will sign an executive order today to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. Analysts at Dutch bank ING explain why traders are edgy: While President Trump\u2019s \u2018too strong\u2019 dollar comment and combative inaugural address has taken some of the steam out of the greenback\u2019s rally, we remain wary that dollar strength could be the ultimate by-product of the new President\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy stance. Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration. With a US economy already close to full employment, it is difficult not to see Trump\u2019s fiscal plans generating sufficient inflationary pressures to drive US yields and the dollar higher. But equally, investors are placing greater focus on future US trade and foreign policy. Naturally the market may be bracing itself for President Trump to formally name China a currency manipulator. In practice, this would spark bilateral negotiations rather than any immediate tariffs but presumably the market wouldn\u2019t take too kindly to this. That has weighed on the London stock market; the FTSE 100 is currently down 42 points at 7156, meaning its early 2017 gains have been wiped out. The City\u2019s new year optimism has rather fizzled out, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having hit a fresh all-time high this time last Monday, an aggressively negative series of sessions last week, largely inspired by the pound\u2019s gains following Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speeches, has effectively wiped away the remarkable gains it managed in the first fortnight of 2017. The FTSE still has a way to go before it dips under the key 7000 level; however, the index\u2019s rampant optimism does seem to have come to an end in conjunction with the pound beginning to peek its head above the parapet after a month or so of suffering. Trump anxiety, and the weak dollar, also helped to push the gold price up to a two-month high, as part of a general move to safer assets. US media are reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that would start the process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (the free trade bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico). This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to those paying attention to the US election, as Paul McNamara of investment group GAM points out: Meanwhile in Europe, protesting farmers have been spraying powdered milk at the EU council headquarters in Brussels. The demonstration, organised by the European Milk Board, is meant to put pressure on ministers to help support milk powder prices. According to news service Agriland, the farmers want the EU to agree not to release stocks from the EU\u2019s milk powder mountain. That would allow them to cut production and push up prices. The EMB says: \u201cThe dairy market is still stuck in a crisis. Voluntary production cuts might have led to a rise in prices, but the sale of milk powder from EU intervention stocks would, once again, put the market under pressure.\u201d \u201cWe need a permanent crisis instrument that prevents surpluses on the dairy market and leads to long-term stability,\u201d according to the board. AFP\u2019s Marine Laouchez of AFP filmed a videoclip of the protests: Newsflash: Mario Draghi is now collecting the 2016 Camillo Cavour prize, awarded for his work strengthening Italy. And the ECB president is talking about the instability currently in play in Italy and beyond, as he compares the situation today to the mid-19th century, when Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, helped unify Italy. His speech is on the ECB website, in Italian -- here\u2019s what Google Translate makes of it.... Cavour acted in a European context suddenly destabilized by the 1848 revolutions that had disrupted the balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna after the fall of Napoleon. It was a period of turbulent transition, in which for the protagonists of European politics opened large joint opportunities to large risks. Today we are again in a historical phase in which Europe is moving, after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, the reunification of Germany, the effects of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the UK via exit \u2018 European Union, the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. In different words, now as then we could say that it is looking for a new stability. ECB president Mario Draghi has just been sighted in Turin, where he\u2019ll be giving a speech at a prize-giving ceremony (in memory of Italian statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour) We\u2019ll watch out for any monetary policy signals from Draghi (who left interest rates unchanged last week) The eurozone\u2019s total national debt has shrunk to its smallest level in four years, when measured against its total economy. New figures from Eurostat show that the euro area national debt dropped to 90.1% of GDP in the July-September 2016 quarter, almost a whole percentage point lower than the previous three months. That means that Europe\u2019s economy has been growing at a slightly faster rate than its borrowing has expanded: Today\u2019s selloff means the FTSE 100 has lost virtually all the gains it made this year. The rally that began after the shock US election result in early November appears to have petered out, as investors face the reality of a Trump presidency. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there is a gloomy mood in the markets, with the FTSE 100 currently down 41 points at 7156. The week has started on a bearish note, with the FTSE 100 falling over 40 points in early trading. The index has lost around 3% since its peak earlier in January, although it has held the breakout line of 7130 that marked its previous high. The steady deterioration in risk appetite over the past few days nicely bookends the post-election period, which began with such furious buying of stocks. Disappointment has set in, but it has not yet turned to disillusionment. This chart, from the Wall Street Journal, show how market volatility has risen while money flowed out of the markets last week: City investors are disappointed that Trump\u2019s inauguration speech contained little detail on fiscal policy, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. As Kit Juckes of French Bank Societe Generale puts it: Instead, the message was combative, protectionist and isolationist, while the media focus was on the size of crowds and the women\u2019s movement marches in the US and elsewhere. Here\u2019s our take on Crowdgate: London\u2019s stock market has opened in the red. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 64 points, or 0.9%, to 7134 points. That\u2019s partly due to the strength of the pound (which will hurt exporters, and make UK shares more expensive for foreign investors to buy). Financial stocks are leading the selloff, with Admiral Group down 2.5%, RBS down 2.2% and Barclays losing 2%. Other European markets are also falling, with anxiety over Trump to the fore. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the markets are being driven by the weaker dollar this morning. So far the new president has stoked protectionism but offered little detail on the good stuff \u2013 pro-growth infrastructure spending, stimulus etc. That\u2019s ensuring the dollar starts the week on the back foot, trading at its weakest since early December. Gold is trading at a two-month high as safe haven assets are bid. We\u2019ll be looking for more details on spending and growth plans in the coming days, which could revive the long dollar trade. The dollar is down 0.5% against other currencies this morning. RBC Capital Markets blame: ...the lack of economic policy detail in President Trump\u2019s inauguration speech coupled with concerns over his potential protectionist stance. Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric is driving down the US dollar this morning. The greenback is in retreat against most major currencies, sending the British pound up 0.75 of a cent to $1.245. That\u2019s its highest level since 19 December. Ilya Spivak of Daily FX reports that traders are anxious, piling into US debt and the Japanese yen, and gold of course. The euro is also gaining ground, up 0.35% at $1.074 this morning. Trump\u2019s unpopularity, unpredictability and unyielding determination to put US interests first are all worrying for traders, who have the unenviable task of trying to guess his next move. Kathleen Brooks of City Index say investors will be watching Trump\u2019s first week as president closely: After the \u201cjoyless rant\u201d of Trump\u2019s inauguration speech on Friday (to paraphrase Simon Schama, writing in the FT at the weekend), the world is watching to see what will be included in the rush of executive orders that are forecast to come in the coming days. This will hopefully give us an idea if Trump has a coherent set of views that could be considered a plausible economic policy. If his team use \u201calternative facts\u201d about the size of the much-anticipated infrastructure spending programme, for instance, or if he walks away from rolling back years of financial market regulation, two key drivers of the stock market rally since Trump\u2019s election in November, then the stock market rally could whither and die. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are starting the week in a nervous mood, as Donald Trump gets his feet under the Oval Office desk. Gold has hit a two-month high in early trading, with investors anxious about the new president\u2019s combative inauguration speech on Friday. Trump\u2019s vow to put America First means more worries about protectionism, and potential trade wars. Bullion is changing hands at $1,217 per ounce, the highest since late November, in a sign that investors are looking for safe assets. Many City experts are predicting that trading will be edgy in the next few months, as Reuters explains: With the lack of a clear policy direction from Trump, the market movement is a sign that risk aversion is back on the table, OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan said. The market could witness volatility into the first 100 days of the Trump administration, he added. Shares in Europe are expected to drop too, as local currencies gain against the US dollar. Also coming up The economic calendar is a little sparse today, but there are a few things to watch out for: 11.30am GMT: ECB President Mario Draghi will deliver a speech on the occasion of the awarding of the Premio Camillo Cavour organised by Fondazione Camillo Cavour in Turin 1.15pm GMT: ECB Board Member Peter Praet delivers a speech at \u201cEuropean Pillar of Social Rights Conference\u201d, in Brussels 3pm: The EC\u2019s monthly Eurozone consumer confidence survey",

Good results from Logitech and Banco Santander were also a factor in the confident mood on the continent.</p> <p>But with the dollar weakening and pushing the pound to six week highs - sterling is now up 0.8% at $1.2620 - the FTSE 100 has missed out on much of the gains. The leading UK index is packed with overseas earners who have benefited from a weak pound but tend to lose ground when sterling strengthens.

But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities.</p> <p>Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888d840e4b0cea1f09276aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:55:10.715Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets.

Reuters writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. </p> <p> In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. </p> <p> The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888cb8de4b0cea1f0927647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:05:13.128Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high.</p> <p>Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished.</p> <p>Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality.</p> <p>There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force.</p> <p>We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f455e286f8c1584cb93e646184a2db02932ab0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f455e286f8c1584cb93e646184a2db02932ab0a/0_137_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c4d0e4b029dbeb0a6509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:32:47.420Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In all honesty it couldn\u2019t have come a moment too soon, finally putting us out of our misery so we can start to focus on something else more important.</p> <p>On a serious note, while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the breaking of a significant milestone, in the broader scheme of things it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, apart from giving investors a feel good boost.</p> <p>Of more importance is whether or not it is able to sustain these gains at a time when US stocks are already considered expensive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c3cde4b029dbeb0a6501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:30:11.361Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It looked for a while as if the Trump rally which followed the election of the US president was about to run out of steam, as the Dow tried and failed a couple of times to breach the 20,000 barrier. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier.</p> <p>These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6<sup>th</sup>. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c0cee4b0cea1f09275f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:17:18.980Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: The moment that the Dow hit 20,000 for the first time ever <a href=\"https://t.co/0fvzncrKtP\">pic.twitter.com/0fvzncrKtP</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888bd1ce4b029dbeb0a64d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:59:27.717Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the big movers so far in the Dow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1/0_0_637_684/466.jpg\" alt=\"Dow movers\" width=\"466\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow movers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:46:34.880Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5888ba23e4b0cea1f09275d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:53:49.677Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1/0_0_1180_759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow hits 20,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow hits 20,000</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888b93ee4b0cea1f09275cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:43:41.039Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier.

Fears about protectionism are running second to optimism about inflation and growth \u2013 for now at least.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, far from roiling markets, has been greeted with universal optimism about what it means for global growth. Something like $3trillion has been pulled from bonds and $3trillion pumped into equities. President Trump is bound to take credit for the rally, and he may well be justified to some degree...</p> <p>The question now is how long can this last? Economists are usually unwise to make predictions, so it\u2019s worth considering both potential outcomes. </p> <p>One argument says that Trump will usher in a Reaganesque shift in the US economy, fuelling a massive reallocation of investment from cash to productive capital...</p> <p>Trump\u2019s first steps as president have confirmed much of what investors had hoped for and that he\u2019s extremely pro-business and light on regulation for energy and financials. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving this renewed rally.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34faad3644e4a52a368e2f8c761c14d394abbc75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34faad3644e4a52a368e2f8c761c14d394abbc75/0_76_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow opens above 20,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow opens above 20,000</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The other argument claims that this is a massive bubble, irrational exuberance of the worst kind that will come unstuck when Trump fails to deliver the reflationary policies that the market is pinning its hopes on...</p> <p>However, bull markets normally only turn into bear markets on an expected downturn in the real economy. There is little evidence that the US is heading for recession \u2013 quite the reverse as Trump is ushering a new era of pro-business policies that affirm growth prospects.</p> <p>We are seeing a massive shift in investor sentiment that has seen money pour out of bonds and into equities around the world. This is a major recalibration in global stocks and bond markets \u2013 ie, not a bubble in the pure sense, although it might be rising faster than is natural.</p> <p>[If] this is a real rotation from bonds into stocks, ending a 30-year bond bull market, there is still a huge amount of cash piled up that could yet pour into equities and power further gains through 2017. It might not be too long before 21,000 is in sight.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:04:29.736Z\">at 3.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5888b677e4b086d04facffdf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:30:50.339Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow hits 20,000</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And it\u2019s there!

                "bodyText":"The global market surge which has led to the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally breaking through the 20,000 has also seen other markets move higher. The records set by the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite, boosted by the Trump rally and reasonable updates from US stalwarts such as Boeing, have helped lift European markets. Good results from Logitech and Banco Santander were also a factor in the confident mood on the continent. But with the dollar weakening and pushing the pound to six week highs - sterling is now up 0.8% at $1.2620 - the FTSE 100 has missed out on much of the gains. The leading UK index is packed with overseas earners who have benefited from a weak pound but tend to lose ground when sterling strengthens. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% or 14.09 points to 7164.43 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.82% to 11,806.05 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.99% to 4877.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.42% higher at 19,582.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.73% at 9549.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.96% to 659.19 On Wall Street the Dow is now up 144 points or 0.7% at 20,056. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. There is much talk about whether the current stock market levels mean we are in a new bubble phase (leading fund manager Neil Woodford recently compared the euphoria of recent months to the dotcom boom and bust). But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities. Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields. And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets. Via Twitter of course: Away from the Dow for a moment, and early elections in Italy could be on the cards after a call ruling. Reuters writes: Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible. The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746. It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains. The S&amp;P is currently 0.6% higher, while Nasdaq is 0.74% better. And some seem confident the US rally will continue. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high. Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished. Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality. There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force. We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies. There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In all honesty it couldn\u2019t have come a moment too soon, finally putting us out of our misery so we can start to focus on something else more important. On a serious note, while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the breaking of a significant milestone, in the broader scheme of things it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, apart from giving investors a feel good boost. Of more importance is whether or not it is able to sustain these gains at a time when US stocks are already considered expensive. It looked for a while as if the Trump rally which followed the election of the US president was about to run out of steam, as the Dow tried and failed a couple of times to breach the 20,000 barrier. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier. These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record. It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6th. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced. Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates. And here are the big movers so far in the Dow: Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride. The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier. Dominic Rushe writes: The Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through the 20,000 barrier on Wednesday morning \u2013 a historic high for the leading stock market index and one it has been close to breaching since Christmas. The Dow, which first nearly topped 20,000 on 13 December and again on 6 January, when it came within 0.37 points of the landmark, finally broke through after the opening bell was rung on Wall Street by Ashton Poole, CEO of lender Triangle Capital. The closing bell will be rung by executives from InBev, brewers of Stella Artois but whether the Dow\u2019s rise will go flat by then remains to be seen. The market had rallied sharply in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory but seemed to loose steam ahead of his first day in office. It broke the barrier of Wednesday after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market\u2019s open, boosted by Trump\u2019s renewed pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment. The Dow record comes as the S&amp;P 500 index, tech-heavy Nasdaq and London\u2019s FTSE 100 stock market index have all hit record highs. So is this a bubble or something sustainable? Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said The Dow has capped a remarkable rally since Donald Trump\u2019s election by finally breaking the 20,000 level. It\u2019s psychologically huge and, after a bit of pullback ahead of the inauguration, really confirms that the \u2018great rotation\u2019 from bonds to stocks is definitely upon us. Fears about protectionism are running second to optimism about inflation and growth \u2013 for now at least. Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, far from roiling markets, has been greeted with universal optimism about what it means for global growth. Something like $3trillion has been pulled from bonds and $3trillion pumped into equities. President Trump is bound to take credit for the rally, and he may well be justified to some degree... The question now is how long can this last? Economists are usually unwise to make predictions, so it\u2019s worth considering both potential outcomes. One argument says that Trump will usher in a Reaganesque shift in the US economy, fuelling a massive reallocation of investment from cash to productive capital... Trump\u2019s first steps as president have confirmed much of what investors had hoped for and that he\u2019s extremely pro-business and light on regulation for energy and financials. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving this renewed rally. The other argument claims that this is a massive bubble, irrational exuberance of the worst kind that will come unstuck when Trump fails to deliver the reflationary policies that the market is pinning its hopes on... However, bull markets normally only turn into bear markets on an expected downturn in the real economy. There is little evidence that the US is heading for recession \u2013 quite the reverse as Trump is ushering a new era of pro-business policies that affirm growth prospects. We are seeing a massive shift in investor sentiment that has seen money pour out of bonds and into equities around the world. This is a major recalibration in global stocks and bond markets \u2013 ie, not a bubble in the pure sense, although it might be rising faster than is natural. [If] this is a real rotation from bonds into stocks, ending a 30-year bond bull market, there is still a huge amount of cash piled up that could yet pour into equities and power further gains through 2017. It might not be too long before 21,000 is in sight. And it\u2019s there! The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 116 points and has crossed through 20,000 for the first time. Just a couple of minutes now until Wall Street opens and the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average could indeed make 20,000 for the first time. The Trump rally and some positive trading updates from the likes of Boeing and hard drive maker Seagate look set to help push markets higher. Elsewhere, shares in BT are struggling to make any ground after Tuesday\u2019s 21% slump in the wake of an accounting scandal at its Italian business and a weak outlook for a couple of its other divisions. They have edged up 0.7% to 305.1p, but this is not exactly a big dent in Tuesday\u2019s \u00a38bn loss. Meanwhile Italian prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating BT Italy. Milan prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale told FastFT that the probe was focused on allegations of \u201cfalse accounting and embezzlement\u201d, as reported on Tuesday. And to add to BT\u2019s woes, the situation is also being looked at by the Financial Reporting Council, which said: \u201dWe are aware of BT\u2019s statement about its review of accounting issues in its Italian business and we will consider if these matters require the FRC to investigate whether the auditors fulfilled their duties.\u201d Elsewhere, the head of BT Europe Corrado Sciolla was said on Tuesday to be resigning over the scandal, and now Reuters is reporting that Luis Alvarez, the head of BT Global Service, is expected to take over the running of the European division. IG reckon that Wall Street traders can get the Dow 20k hats out. New York trading begins in 90 minutes time.... After weeks of near-misses, could the Dow Jones finally hit the 20,000 point mark today? The global stock market rally today is raising speculation that the Dow could hit this benchmark for the first time; it closed at 19,912 on Tuesday night. With every European stock market up today, the futures market suggests Wall Street will follow suit, helped by optimism that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for infrastructure spending will boost corporate profits. 20,000 is just a number, of course - but some traders would be happy to get the issue out of the way. If it does happen, expect @realDonaldTrump to take the credit.... The US dollar has dipped to a seven-week low against a basket of other major currencies (including the pound) this morning. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Services, says there is \u201cbroad-based selling pressure on the dollar\u201d. Bloomberg has more details: Boom! The pound just hit $1.26 for the first time since December 14. Newsflash from parliament: Theresa May has just revealed that the government will publish a white paper outlining its Brexit plan. That may please the City, as it will more insight into the government\u2019s ambitions for the EU exit negotiations. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: France\u2019s credit rating could come under threat if populist far-right Marine Le Pen reached the final stage of the country\u2019s presidential race, an official from Moody\u2019s has said. Reuters has the story: Asked whether Le Pen progressing to the second round would prompt Moody\u2019s to move the outlook on France\u2019s Aa2 credit rating to negative, Dietmar Hornung said, \u201cThat is the obvious thing.\u201d He gave the example of how Moody\u2019s waited until after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to put the UK\u2019s rating on a negative outlook, however. The negative impact of the rating \u201cwouldn\u2019t persist if then in the second round Fillon or Macron or whoever wins,\u201d he told Reuters. Le Pen is currently second favourite to win the presidential race, behind right-winger Francois Fillon. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard is out! Our monthly healthcheck on the UK economy shows that the fall in the pound following the EU referendum is hurting the economy, pushing inflation higher. The latest retail sales, house prices and trade figures were all disappointing too, although the economy does seem to still be growing steadily (we get new GDP figures tomorrow). My colleague Katie Allen, who compiles the report explains: Seven months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows the weaker pound is being felt in the real economy more keenly than ever, as it raises the cost of imports such as energy and food and that gets passed on to consumers as higher prices in the shops. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for January shows a worse than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. Inflation was higher than economists had forecast, hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s the key charts: And here\u2019s Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former Bank of England policymakers, on the numbers. Just in: UK manufacturers are their most upbeat since January 2015, according to the latest Industrial Trends survey from the CBI. Factories also reported that domestic orders have grown strongly over the last quarter, but export growth has dipped back. The survey shows that the pound\u2019s tumble is pushing up import prices, but it\u2019s also making UK firms more competitive in the global market. And a quarter of companies reported that they are worried they can\u2019t hire skilled staff - that\u2019s the highest level since July 1989. Here\u2019s the report. Optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s spending plans are expected to push shares higher on Wall Street later today. The futures markets shows the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rising by 0.3%, having hit record highs on Tuesday. Relief that the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling is out of the way is pushing the pound towards $1.26, says Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG. Despite yesterday\u2019s court decision, markets continue to enjoy a degree of clarity over the UK\u2019s path that has not been seen since June\u2019s referendum result. With Citibank and Credit Suisse the latest banks to voice their plans to move jobs out of London, it is clear that Theresa May needs to have a robust and dramatic jobs strategy if we are going to see the UK maintain growth over the coming years. The UK pound is having a good morning, rising 0.5% to hit a six-week high of $1.2598 against the dollar. This recovers yesterday\u2019s losses, which came after the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling. Traders are now watching to see what legislation the government brings to trigger the exit process from the EU. Rebellious Conservative MPs are now pushing for a full debate on the Brexit plan, and are concerned about Britain\u2019s likely exit from the single market and the customs union. So the pound is likely to remain volatile. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the length of this Act will be critical: For all the furore (aka political windbagging) around yesterday\u2019s UK Constitutional Court ruling, the only real question is how \u201ctight\u201d the wording of the Act of Parliament (to trigger Article 50) will be. The trick to stopping opponents tagging on conditions would be to make the Act very short, say as little as one paragraph, which would then make it very difficult to change as the rules state that \u201camendments must be ruled to be within the scope of the original text\u201d. It should be emphasized that \u2018no one won anything\u2019 with the ruling, it is a simple principle that Parliament has to be consulted, if a proposed statute implies a change to the UK\u2019s basic law - Article 50 clearly fits that principle 100%. The pound is also up 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.171, meaning one euro is worth 85.3p. That will be welcomed by UK holidaymakers, and eurozone firms who export goods into the UK, points out Dublin-based broker Paul Sommerville. Here\u2019s Neil Wilson of ETX Capital on today\u2019s market moves: There\u2019s something of the Trump bump about all this. For instance, rising copper prices are a sign that global growth is turning positive off the back of his expected reflationary policies. But another leading indicator, the Baltic Dry Index, has slumped of late, a signal that fears of protectionist policies are very high. It\u2019s a mixed picture for miners and uncertain for sure. BHP Billiton was up nearly 2% as it looks set to benefit from rising metal prices. Fresnillo edged lower despite reporting record annual silver and gold production, as prices for the two metals slipped. Shares in UK eateries group Restaurant Group have slumped by 10% this morning, after another disappointing trading update. The company, which runs Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s. Garfunkel\u2019s, Brunning &amp; Price, Chiquito and other chains, posted a 3.9% drop in like-for-like sales. It also predicted a \u2018difficult\u2019 trading performance over the next six months, as it tries to shake up its offerings to tempt customers Restaurant Group also admitted that the slump in the pound will drive up input costs, and said the apprenticeship levy, proposed increases in business rates and higher energy taxes will bring extra cost pressures. Oof!! Confidence among German executives has weakened to a five-month low. The IFO survey of German business confidence has missed forecasts, falling to 109.8 this month from 111 in December. Economists expected a small rise to 111.3 Clemens Fuest, head of the IFO economic institute, says German firms are happy with the current situation, but less optimistic about the outlook over the next six months. At times like this, we all need a laugh. And strong sales of spoof humour books and growing customer numbers at airport shops gave WH Smith reason for cheer in its latest trading update. A comic revival of Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five characters helped to lift like-for-like sales 1% at the retailer over the 21 weeks to 21 January, with Five on Brexit Island and Five Give up the Booze among the best-sellers. Sales at its network of shops in travel locations such as motorway service stations and airports were up 5%, but down 3% at its shops on UK high streets. The retailer, which this year celebrates its 225th birthday, said that strong sales of spoof humour books and seasonal stationery were offset by year-on-year sales figures for adult colouring books that were tough to beat, having sold really well over the same period last year. Chief executive Stephen Clarke sounded a broadly positive note: \u201cAs a result of the performance in travel we expect group profit growth for the year to be slightly ahead of plan. \u201cWhile there is some uncertainty in the broader economic environment, we remain confident that the group is well positioned for the year ahead as we continue to focus on profitable growth, cash generation and investing in new opportunities.\u201d And the verdict from veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb? \u201cAlthough the comparisons were tough, the business has come through well. How far the 225th Anniversary celebrations of the company help trade this year remains to be seen, but the City will be relieved by the strong Christmas trading performance.\u201d Shares were up 7.6% at \u00a315.93 in early trading, making the retailer the biggest riser on the FTE 250 in early trading. The Mexican Peso has weakened by 0.15% today, to 21.56 peso to the US dollar. It\u2019s suffering from president Trump\u2019s threat to erect a wall on the US-Mexico border. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Trump tweets continue to drive sentiment and the President\u2019s most recent - \u201cBig day planned fort NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among other things, we will build the wall!\u201d - saw the Mexican peso reverse Monday/Tuesday gains. German government bond prices are falling this morning, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on bunds to a six-week high. That shows that investors are moving money out of safe-haven assets and into shares. The pound is holding firm at $1.252 this morning, as the City waits for the government to publish its bill on exiting the European Union. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has gained almost 1% this morning, putting it on track for its biggest gain of 2017. Solid earning figures from Santander, which posted a 4% increase in revenue, are helping the mood. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has gained nearly 0.7% this morning, as it gains 48 points to 7199. Mining group Antofagasta is leading the rally, up over 5%, after reporting a solid production report. Other miners are also on the up because commodity prices are bouncing ahead, on hopes of a US spending boost from Trump. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says this strength in base metals is driving the markets up. Copper in particular up on restricted supply (BHP Billiton cut guidance; prolonged strikes could make matters worse) and growth/inflation expectations from US infrastructure spending plans as Trump sticks to his campaign hymn sheet. Aluminium, Iron Ore, Lead and Zinc are all tagging along while Oil holds around $53/55, near the mid-point of a $50-60 range as US production increases challenge OPEC cuts. Traders have a lot to fret about right now, from Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist threats to Britain\u2019s push towards Brexit. But today, shares are rising on optimism that the global economy may strengthen this year, as Trump starts to delivers on fiscal stimulus boost he promised during his campaign. Last night, America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices both hit new record highs, as Trump controversially approved two energy projects. This pushed shares up on Wall Street, as Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, told CNBC: \u201cI think the real lift in the market was the second round of executive orders from the White House. This is very much a Trump-infrastructure rally.\u201d This has fed through to Asia where most markets rallied, with Japan\u2019s Topix index up 1%. There\u2019s a positive start in Europe too, with the main markets gaining ground in early trading. Donald Trump has alarmed many observers with his early moves as president, with environmentalists aghast that he is reviving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. But in the cold-hearted world of the markets, the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 is back on, as Kathleen Brooks of City Index puts it. US stock markets have showed renewed signs of life this week, and the Nasdaq made a fresh record high on Tuesday as the market toyed with the idea of reigniting the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 that we saw in the aftermath of the presidential election last November. Based on Tuesday\u2019s performance, it looks like the market is happy with the first flourish of Trump\u2019s executive orders. History suggests that there could be further upside for stocks.... Trump also advanced the Keystone Pipeline project on Tuesday, something that President Obama slapped down. These first steps may not please climate change activists, but, as expected, they suggest that President Trump is \u2018business friendly\u2019 and the markets are greeting this with approval. Thus, stocks are in a strong position as we move to the middle of the week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up today. 9am GMT: German IFO confidence report for January, showing how optimistic business leaders in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy are this month. 11am: CBI Industrial trends survey, showing how Britain\u2019s factories are faring 3.30pm: US crude oil inventory figures 4pm: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking at a banking conference in Wiesbaden, Germany.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending.</p> <p>Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u2019s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u2019s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u2019s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth.</p> <p>The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u2019s flash crash. It\u2019s still politics (not economic growth) that is the driving force for sterling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-588a12a4e4b0b3e971af2fc5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-26T15:21:19.936Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US home sales drop in December</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another set of US data, this time showing a sharp fall in home sales in December after three months of strong gains.</p> <p>New single family home sales fell by 10.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month, a ten month low.

Already two thirds of working households say they\u2019re just about managing to make their money stretch and with few having enough savings to back them up, lots of people will feel the pinch. There\u2019s a real risk this could impact growth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really worth everyone giving their bank balance a health check now. Knowing how much you have coming in each month, checking where your money is going and looking at how you can make simple savings is the best way to make sure you can cope as life gets more expensive.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s <strong>Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u2019s </strong>savings specialist: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The cheaper pound may be bad news for those queuing at the checkout, as rising import costs push up prices, but it provides new opportunities for UK exporters and a boost for the UK tourism industry. We mustn\u2019t let the UK\u2019s strong economic output mask the issues facing Brits up and down the country.</p> <p>Consumers are already battling rising food, transport and energy costs, and with an interest rate rise also possible in 2017, households will find little comfort in the macro-economic picture.</p> <p>Even so, people shouldn\u2019t cut back on putting money aside if they can.

As a result, the services sector has continued to be the driving force for the UK economy in recent quarters. The world economy has also helped economic growth with positive indicators in all the main economic regions - Europe, North America and Asia.</p> <p>\u201c2017 will be a more testing year for the UK economy as consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation. Despite this, we should expect the underlying resilience of the UK economy and healthy global growth to support economic activity in the year ahead. That should enable GDP to grow by close to 1.5% in 2017 even though Brexit uncertainties will have a dampening effect.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p> This is from <strong>Ian Kernohan</strong>, economist at <strong>Royal London Asset Managemen</strong>t:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFar from plunging into recession after the vote to leave the EU, the UK was actually the fastest growing G7 economy in 2016.

This included strong contributions from consumer-focused activities, business services and finance. </p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead to 2017, the major question is whether a squeeze on real household incomes, and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the corporate sector, will be offset by the benefits of cheaper sterling against a stronger backdrop of global economic growth.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ms Lee Hopley</strong>, Chief Economist at <strong>EEF</strong>, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, also sees a slowdown this year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cChallenges abound for forecasters in 2017, but we\u2019d caution against complacency.</p> <p>Consumers won\u2019t be ramping up spending thanks to rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, and businesses\u2019 appetite to sign off big investments will depend on how they view the progress of Brexit negotiations.

                "bodyText":"In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average may have continued to head higher in early trading following Wednesday\u2019s long-awaited breach of the 20,000 barrier, but the picture was less clear in Europe. Some support was given by Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s $30bn deal to buy Swiss biotech firm Actelion, but some mixed results from the likes of Unilever and Sage (badly received) and Diageo (positive) left markets struggling for direction. In the event only Germany\u2019s Dax managed to end the day in positive territory although the declines elsewhere were limited. In the UK the pound dipped on continuing concerns about Brexit, despite better than expected GDP figures, but the FTSE 100 failed to take advantage. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped 2.94 points or 0.04% to 7161.49 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.36% to 11,848.63 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.21% to 4867.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 19,439.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9512.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 660.59 On Wall Street the Dow is currently up 28 points at 20,096. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. News that Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.has called off a proposed meeting with Donald Trump next week as the two side argue about who should pay for the new US president\u2019s infamous wall plan has hit the Mexican currency: The pound continues to be weaker, slipping back from its six week highs. Despite the better than expected UK GDP figures, concerns about the evenutal outcome of Brexit have helped push sterling down 0.49% against the dollar to $1.2568. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending. Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u2019s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u2019s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u2019s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth. The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u2019s flash crash. It\u2019s still politics (not economic growth) that is the driving force for sterling. Another set of US data, this time showing a sharp fall in home sales in December after three months of strong gains. New single family home sales fell by 10.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month, a ten month low. November\u2019s figure was revised up from 592,000 to 598,000. Economists had expected a fall, but only 1% to around 588.000. The positive US service sector figures come after news earlier this week than manufacturing was also performing well in January, and together they point to further Federal Reserve interest rises, said survey compiler IHS Markit. Chris Williamson, its chief business economist, said: The improvement in service sector business conditions follows the news earlier in the week that manufacturing also enjoyed a bumper start to the year. The two PMI surveys collectively point to the economy growing at an annualised rate of just over 2.5% in January, and puts the US on a strong footing to achieve faster growth in 2017. IHS Markit currently forecasts that the US economy will grow by 2.3% in 2017, up from 1.6% in 2016. Although the strong dollar is hitting exports, domestic demand clearly remains buoyant. Companies reported one of the highest inflows of new business for a year and a half as demand lifted higher at the start of 2017. Job creation also remained encouragingly solid, and especially impressive given current high overall levels of employment in the economy. Job gains are linked to increased optimism about the economic outlook. Business expectations of future growth are at their highest for just over one and a half years. The strong start to 2017 and bullish mood for the year ahead adds to our expectation that we will see the Fed hike rates a further three times in 2017. The US services sector has performed slightly better than expected in January, according to initial estimates. Markit\u2019s flash service sector PMI came in at 55.1, up from 53.9 in December and higher than the forecast figure of 54.4. The composite index - which includes services and manufacturing - was 55.4, up from 54.1 in December. Earlier the advance goods trade balance dipped from -$65.3bn to -$65. After Wednesday\u2019s record breaking run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged through the 20,000 barrier for the first time, US markets have opened the new trading day on a positive note. The Dow is up 21 points at 20,089 , while both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have hit new highs, albeit with marginal percentage gains so far. The moves come despite a mixed bag of company results, with Caterpillar and Whirlpool issuing disappointing numbers but cable operator Comcast and eBay both pleasing the market with their latest updates. Just in: More Americans than expected signed on for jobless benefits last week. The closely watched Initial Claims figure rose to 259,000 in the seven days to January 21st (the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration), from 237,000 the previous week. Economists had expected a smaller rise, to 247,000. The number of Americans who remained on unemployment support also picked up. Called the \u2018continued claims\u2019 figure, it rose to 2.1 million, from 2.059 million the week before. Over in America, construction and equipment giant Caterpillar has surprised Wall Street by posting a 13% drop in sales in the last three months. Caterpillar, seen as a bellwether for global growth, was also cautious about its prospects, warning that the \u201coverall environment remains challenging\u201d. Time for a recap, with links to the key points in the blog Britain\u2019s economy has beaten expectations by posting growth of 0.6% in the final three months of last year. Service sector companies provided the growth, while pharmaceuticals firms helped UK manufacturing to expand. But construction only grew 0.1% and industrial production was flat. Here are the details: The Office for National Statistics said the economy ended 2016 with \u201csteady growth\u201d. Chancellor Philip Hammond said Britain is well-positioned to handle \u2018uncertainty\u2019 this year. But the TUC is worried that real incomes will be squeezed this year as inflation rises. The figures are the latest sign that Britain\u2019s economy has not been knocked off course by last June\u2019s EU referendum. GDP growth over the second half of 2016 was faster than in the first six months. Here\u2019s what people are saying about that. This means Britain was probably the fastest growing G7 economy this year - that will be confirmed once we get GDP from the US, the eurozone, Canada and Japan in the coming days. However, growth was less impressive on a per-capita basis, adjusting for increases in population. Here are some good charts. Several economists expect growth to slow this year. Personal finance experts say families need to get ready now. The pound has fallen back from this morning\u2019s six-week highs, and is now trading around $1.256, a fall of 0.5%. This morning\u2019s decent growth figures should have supported sterling, but instead traders are worrying about Brexit again. So says Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com, who writes: This morning\u2019s UK GDP figures surprised to the upside, yet the pound failed to respond positively to the news as it suffered in a typical \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u201d type of a reaction, except that there were no rumours per se. Sterling has been appreciating noticeably in recent days as traders continued to unwind their Brexit trades \u2013 until today. The economic outlook for the UK remains bleak even if the Brexit vote itself hasn\u2019t had any material impact on the economy yet. The pound would do very well to get back to $1.40s again. The full impact of Brexit will not be felt for months \u2013 or even years \u2013 but the uncertainty will most likely prevent sterling from appreciating significantly in the interim. So get used to seeing see more chop and churn in GBP for the foreseeable future. Personal finance experts are urging families to get ready for a financial squeeze in 2017, as higher inflation eats into household incomes. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk says: \u201cIt\u2019s a real relief to see the economy has proved resilient against the Brexit backdrop, this puts us in a solid position to navigate the uncertain year ahead. Households haven\u2019t been scared out of spending by doom and gloom projections of life outside of the EU and this has really helped to push growth forward. \u201cMy biggest concern right now is how households will cope with rising costs over the coming year. Already two thirds of working households say they\u2019re just about managing to make their money stretch and with few having enough savings to back them up, lots of people will feel the pinch. There\u2019s a real risk this could impact growth. \u201cIt\u2019s really worth everyone giving their bank balance a health check now. Knowing how much you have coming in each month, checking where your money is going and looking at how you can make simple savings is the best way to make sure you can cope as life gets more expensive.\u201d And here\u2019s Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u2019s savings specialist: The cheaper pound may be bad news for those queuing at the checkout, as rising import costs push up prices, but it provides new opportunities for UK exporters and a boost for the UK tourism industry. We mustn\u2019t let the UK\u2019s strong economic output mask the issues facing Brits up and down the country. Consumers are already battling rising food, transport and energy costs, and with an interest rate rise also possible in 2017, households will find little comfort in the macro-economic picture. Even so, people shouldn\u2019t cut back on putting money aside if they can. Building a nest egg and having the comfort of a lump sum to fall back on is invaluable when money starts to tighten.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond has told City reporters not to expect a thrilling budget in March: If the Remain Campaign\u2019s warnings had been accurate, this is the day that Britain would have officially entered recession. But rather than two quarters of contraction, today\u2019s figures show the economy actually grew by 1.2% in the last six months after the EU referendum. Of course, Britain hasn\u2019t triggered Article 50 yet, let alone actually leave the EU. But our economics editor Larry Elliott thinks there\u2019s more to it than that: A better explanation for the robust performance of the economy is that consumers have carried on spending. The factors that underpinned domestic demand ahead of the referendum \u2013 low unemployment, rising house prices and rock-bottom interest rates \u2013 are still in place. The Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates and to deliver another dollop of quantitative easing in August has, if anything, created even more growth-friendly conditions. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s numbers, following a meeting with Philip Hammond at Microsoft\u2019s HW. Joanna Partridge of ITV News flags up that Britain probably outperformed its major rivals last year. US GDP figures are released on Friday, followed by eurozone growth figures next Tuesday. Brexit uncertainty is likely to dampen growth this year, according to several City experts, despite the resilient growth in the last three months of 2016. Here\u2019s Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC: \u201cStrong consumer spending has supported growth over the past three months and this has more than offset the dampening impact of Brexit uncertainty in investment. As a result, the services sector has continued to be the driving force for the UK economy in recent quarters. The world economy has also helped economic growth with positive indicators in all the main economic regions - Europe, North America and Asia. \u201c2017 will be a more testing year for the UK economy as consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation. Despite this, we should expect the underlying resilience of the UK economy and healthy global growth to support economic activity in the year ahead. That should enable GDP to grow by close to 1.5% in 2017 even though Brexit uncertainties will have a dampening effect.\u201d This is from Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cFar from plunging into recession after the vote to leave the EU, the UK was actually the fastest growing G7 economy in 2016. GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2016, faster than expected. This included strong contributions from consumer-focused activities, business services and finance. \u201cLooking ahead to 2017, the major question is whether a squeeze on real household incomes, and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the corporate sector, will be offset by the benefits of cheaper sterling against a stronger backdrop of global economic growth.\u201d Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, also sees a slowdown this year. \u201cChallenges abound for forecasters in 2017, but we\u2019d caution against complacency. Consumers won\u2019t be ramping up spending thanks to rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, and businesses\u2019 appetite to sign off big investments will depend on how they view the progress of Brexit negotiations. There\u2019s every chance that this rate of expansion is the high point for the next couple of years Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School, is worried that consumers are relying on borrowing: Several people are pointing out that there\u2019s no sign that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has hurt the economy (yet anyway). This is from Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank: The first 6 months since the Brexit vote have seen growth of almost 2.5% annualised, which is above trend. Clearly, life goes on, despite the Brexit vote. There isn\u2019t an awful lot of detail in the breakdown at this stage. But what we do have shows that services output continues to do all the heavy lifting, while construction output remains the problem child of the UK economy. Here\u2019s columnist Matthew Lynn: Dr Gerald Lyons, former advisor to Boris Johnson, reckons the EU vote - and the interest rate cut by the Bank of England - actually helped the economy. Here\u2019s journalist and BBC presenter Andrew Neil: But.... Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, believes a slowdown is coming: \u201cThe latest retail sales data shows a slowdown in spending, and inflation is only just beginning to bite. Businesses now also have a clearer picture of the path of Brexit, so investment behaviour is likely to change in 2017. \u201cThis all adds up to a potential slowdown in the economy this year - the Bank of England\u2019s gloom about the economic consequences of Brexit could well prove justified in the end, despite the cheery tone of this morning\u2019s data.\u201d Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation is tweeting some interesting GDP charts. This shows how the recovery since the 2008 crash has been much slower than earlier recessions, on a GDP-per-capita basis (growth divided by population). But overall, Britain has done better than its European rivals: Here\u2019s a recording of Bobby Kennedy\u2019s famous speech on the problems with GDP, from 1968. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is worried that workers will suffer in 2017, if wages don\u2019t keep pace with inflation: \u201cOur economy may have been resilient in the face of the Brexit vote, but GDP growth is stuck in the slow lane. And people are still feeling the financial crisis in their pockets. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for government complacency. 2017 will be a challenging year, so ministers can\u2019t let us sleep walk into another living standards crisis. \u201cWorking people mustn\u2019t be forced to pay the price for Brexit. March\u2019s budget must set out a plan to boost wages, and seriously invest in developing our infrastructure and public services.\u201d The 0.7% jump in manufacturing output last quarter is mainly due to a large rise in the erratically performing pharmaceuticals industry. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that Britain\u2019s service sector has been dominant for decades now: Chancellor Philip Hammond has welcomed today\u2019s growth figures, but warned that the economy still faces uncertainty. He says: \u201cEvery major sector of the economy grew last year, which is further evidence of the fundamental strength and resilience of the UK economy. There may be uncertainty ahead as we adjust to a new relationship with Europe, but we are ready to seize the opportunities to create a competitive economy that works for all.\u201d Hammond is visiting Microsoft\u2019s HQ in Reading to discuss the economy, so we should hear more from him later... Digging into the GDP report, we can see that Britain\u2019s retail sector was fastest growing part of the economy. That\u2019s a worry, as it suggests the UK is still reliant on consumer spending (often on imports) rather than a strong manufacturing base. And if households do cut back in 2017, retail will take a hit. Darren Morgan, the head of GDP at the ONS, says Britain\u2019s economy ended last year with \u201csteady growth\u201d. \u201cStrong consumer spending supported the expansion of the dominant services sector and although manufacturing bounced back from a weaker third quarter, both it and construction remained broadly unchanged over the year as a whole.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has now enjoyed four years of uninterrupted growth. It is now 8.7% higher than its pre-crisis peak in 2008. But on a per capita basis (adjusted for population changes), it\u2019s only 1.9% larger. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by 0.7% during the last quarter, nearly as fast as the services sector. Britain\u2019s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, expanding by 0.8%, while construction and industrial output lagged behind (again). Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s GDP report: Growth during Quarter 4 was dominated by services, with a strong contribution from consumer-focused industries such as retail sales and travel agency services. Following falls in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, construction and production provided negligible positive contributions to GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016. UK GDP was estimated to have increased by 2.0% during 2016, slowing slightly from 2.2% in 2015 and from 3.1% in 2014. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.4% during Quarter 4 2016 and by 1.3% during 2016. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% in the last quarter - stronger than the 2.1% growth expected. Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy expanded by 0.6% in the final three months of 2016. That\u2019s stronger than the 0.5% expected by City economists. It matches the growth in the July-September, and shows little sign of any Brexit impact on the UK economy. Five minutes to go! Economists have already warned that the UK economy will slow in 2017, even if last year ended on a high note. The fall in the pound will drive up inflation thus year, eating into household disposable income and ultimately meaning slower growth, according to some City experts. More here: Over in the City, drinks giant Diageo said it had benefited from the slide in the pound against the US dollar and the euro since the Brexit vote. It is estimated to have boosted net sales by about \u00a31.4bn and operating profits by \u00a3460m in the year to 30 June. The maker of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Smirnoff vodka toasted a 28% rise in first-half operating profits to \u00a32.06bn and hiked its interim dividend by 5%. Diageo\u2019s shares rose 4.8% on the news. Unilever fared less well. Its shares slid more than 4% after the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant posted lower-than-expected sales growth of 2.2% for the fourth quarter. It blamed Brazil\u2019s weak economy along with India\u2019s move to withdraw high-value rupee notes to fight corruption. Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters that its European prices were starting to move up again after price deflation in many countries \u2013 partly due to price hikes pushed through in the UK to counteract impact of the weaker pound on the company\u2019s costs. The price rises led to a public spat with Tesco last year, known as Marmitegate. We shouldn\u2019t forge that GDP is a somewhat flawed measure - notable for what it omits, as well as what it includes. GDP is calculated by adding up all the money spent and earned in an economy, and the value of the goods and services produced. That gives a measure of the size of the economy, which you can divide by the population total to get GDP per capita. But it doesn\u2019t include, for example, unpaid work by carers. It doesn\u2019t consider the environmental damage caused by economic growth. Inequality isn\u2019t factored in, nor is the fact that the Internet means we now get many services for free, where once we paid for them. In short, it doesn\u2019t show if life is better or worse. Bobby Kennedy summed GDP up wonderfully in 1968, three months before he was assassinated, when he said: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. Britain\u2019s service sector makes up almost 80% of the economy; this chart from Bloomberg shows how it has provided most of the growth in the last three years: Sterling has hit a new six-week high, as traders await the UK GDP figures in an hour\u2019s time. One pound is now worth $1.266, its highest level since 14 December. The Treasury have published a guide to GDP: It concludes that: GDP matters because it shows how healthy the economy is Rising GDP means the economy is growing, and the resources available to people in the country \u2013 goods and services, wages and profits \u2013 are increasing. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict that the UK economy ended 2016 in solid shape, after a wobble in October. News on economic output was very weak for October (the service sector aside) but the November story saw a reversal for the production sector at least. Together with strong survey evidence for December that prompted us recently to revise up our Q4 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% q/q as a robust contribution from the service sector is expected once again. Today\u2019s GDP figures may show if the prospect of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 has hurt the economy. The fourth quarter of 2016 began with prime minister Theresa May pledging to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017, and making immigration control a top priority. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: We should remember that the prospect of a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 only raised its head in October, so there could be an even larger decline in business investment in the final three months of the year Although this may have no bearing on growth right now, it is likely to impact GDP levels and confidence levels at some point in 2017, so a sharp decline in this figure is worth noting. Good morning. It\u2019s time for another healthcheck on the UK economy, as we press on towards triggering Article 50 and leaving the EU. At 9.30am, new GDP figures will be released showing how Britain performed between October and December 2016. This was a busy time, dominated by the Brexit debate and Donald Trump winning the US election. Did this drama and uncertainty hit the economy, or were consumers and businesses undaunted? Economists are expecting another quarter of solid growth, with GDP expanding by 0.5%. That would be a slight slowdown on the 0.6% recorded between July and September, but well away from the the recession some predicted if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u2019s figures are only preliminary, so we won\u2019t get too much information about the state of the economy. But it will give a breakdown by sector, so we can see if the service sector continued to drive growth, and whether manufacturers are being helped by the weak pound. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to rise, after the US Dow Jones index smashed through 20,000 yesterday. Daily Mail and General Trust, Unilever, Sky, Whitbread, Jimmy Choo and Diageo are all reporting results. There\u2019s also a flurry of excitement in the City as Royal Bank of Scotland announces it\u2019s setting aside another \u00a33.1bn to cover the cost of misselling toxic bonds. Will it never end?....",

In the UK, the FTSE 100 lost all the gains made so far this year, closing at its lowest level since 28 December. Things would have been worse without a boost from Vodafone after the mobile phone group said it was in talks about merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market narrative has shifted once again. For the past three months a Trump presidency has been heralded as great for stocks. Now, with Dow 20,000 behind us, it seems his government can be blamed for the bout of selling that has engulfed markets. The truth, as ever, probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there is probably some truth in the idea that geopolitical jitters are playing a part in price action today. The FTSE 100 has now surrendered all its gains for the year...Markets overall have been ripe for a correction for some time now, and were merely in need of a reason to begin; Trump\u2019s rambunctious opening to his presidency, and the lighter volumes caused by holidays in Asian markets, may well have provided the bears with the opening they needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.92% or 66.01 points at 7118.48</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.12% to 11,681.89</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.14% at 4784.64</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.95% to 18,759.40</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.5% lower at 9361.3</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.53% to 614.08</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 183 points or 0.92% at 19,910.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

The period post-election when markets did best in the twentieth century was the period between Herbert Hoover\u2019s election and his inauguration.

They have a huge stake in the United States supporting an open and tolerant global system, they have that stake for their employees, they have it for their customers, they have it for the reputation of the United States and they have spoken out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on chief executives being threatened by the prospect of Trump tweeting against their companies, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure most of them share the values of inclusion, the values of American tradition that were reflected in the statements that John McCain and Lindsey Graham made, the statements that Jeff Immelt made.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if others don\u2019t have those values or whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if they are being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet. But it\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week.

A merger would almost double the size of the current business and would have more than 50% sales to the US. The business would be particularly strong in Energy, Water and Transportation. We believe that speculation is credible given the industry trend towards consolidation and would potentially create a top 5 global design company. Although the history of M&amp;A is chequered in the sector, we see the potential combination as an early cycle play on growth in US infrastructure. CH2M\u2019s third quarter trading update indicated lower earnings year on year. CH2M has had a challenging time but the suggested valuation of $2bn appears to be a reasonable market cap. The enterprise value is significantly higher, given debt, preference shares, pensions, and perhaps joint venture liabilities. The pension will be a key factor although liabilities have reduced post a controversial deal with the PPF. Premature to assess value creation, but expect limited cost-savings and an interesting debate on revenue synergies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Atkins has already said it is hoping to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure spending plans.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:21:48.493Z\">at 2.21pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588f4814e4b0f1550c0da66f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:10:47.838Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/30/stock-markets-us-dollar-trump-travel-ban-german-inflation-business-live?page=with:block-588f391de4b0860ce556a712#block-588f391de4b0860ce556a712\">the German inflation figures</a>, and despite consumer prices increasing by 1.9% year on year in January, that does not mean the ECB should rein in its stimulus programme, says economist Dr Andreas Rees at UniCredit:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Four weeks ago when the December figure was released, there was an outcry by some media and politicians about rising inflation risks in Germany. The ECB should act by unwinding QE as quickly as possible before it is too late, so the story went. It is likely that you will read such statements once again even the latest headline inflation figure came in a tad below expectations. In our view, this kind of thinking is not based on economic facts for two reasons. First, there are no signs of a persistent upward trend in consumer prices. Instead, it is largely about oil. Second, German private households\u2019 inflation expectations remained well anchored.</p> <p>Let us state the obvious: Rising inflation at the turn of the year has primarily been caused by energy prices, or more precisely by the higher oil price. The latest driver was the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia at the end of November to curb output. It was the first agreement of a global oil cartel since 2001. According to our calculations based on federal states data, inflation excluding food and energy was up a more moderate 1.4% year on year after 1.5% in the previous month....</p> <p>More important, the latest inflation excitement in the media and by some policymakers has been crying wolf as flagged by forward-looking surveys. Private households do not anticipate any surging inflation which goes beyond the energy rise. As a matter of fact, inflation expectations of Germans for the next 12 months hit its trough in spring of last year and rose since then, pretty much in line with what one would expect in the light of the oil price increase. The latest inflation expectations survey for January (conducted by the EU Commission) shows that they still remained below its long-term average. In other words, the allegedly so inflation averse Germans have noticed higher fuel price at the gas stations but they are not really concerned for good reason. </p> <p>Going forward, we expect further rising inflation rates in a range of 2\u00bc%-2\u00bd% year on year for the next three months or so before a stabilisation is kicking in. It will be all about the oil price ... whose effects (on a year on year basis) will be fizzling out in the further course of 2017.

                "bodyText":"The uncertainty and chaos caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban has sent stock markets tumbling. With a number of Asian markets falling overnight - the Nikkei lost 0.5% - Europe and the US soon followed suit. In the UK, the FTSE 100 lost all the gains made so far this year, closing at its lowest level since 28 December. Things would have been worse without a boost from Vodafone after the mobile phone group said it was in talks about merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The market narrative has shifted once again. For the past three months a Trump presidency has been heralded as great for stocks. Now, with Dow 20,000 behind us, it seems his government can be blamed for the bout of selling that has engulfed markets. The truth, as ever, probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there is probably some truth in the idea that geopolitical jitters are playing a part in price action today. The FTSE 100 has now surrendered all its gains for the year...Markets overall have been ripe for a correction for some time now, and were merely in need of a reason to begin; Trump\u2019s rambunctious opening to his presidency, and the lighter volumes caused by holidays in Asian markets, may well have provided the bears with the opening they needed. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.92% or 66.01 points at 7118.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.12% to 11,681.89 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.14% at 4784.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.95% to 18,759.40 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.5% lower at 9361.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.53% to 614.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 183 points or 0.92% at 19,910. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Italy\u2019s biggest bank has said its capital ratios at the end of 2016 would not meet requirements set down by the European Central Bank. The bank is launching a \u20ac13bn rights issue to help bolster its finances, which should put it back on track to meet the ECB levels. It said: [We envisage] a temporary deficit versus the corresponding applicable capital requirement as at 31 December 2016 .... by approximately 2% which is expected to be fully restored upon completion of the rights issue, which, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to be settled before March 10th, 2017 on the basis of the current timetable. The bank also said it expected to make an \u20ac11.8bn loss for 2016, with further negative one-off items: Group financial results are impacted by a number of negative non-recurring items of which approximately \u20ac12.2bn were disclosed at UniCredit\u2019s Capital Markets Day, on December 13th, 2016, in the context of the presentation of the 2016-2019 Strategic Plan.. The Group has taken into account a number of additional negative one-off items amounting to approximately \u20ac1.0bn, which are expected to be recorded in 2016. Such one-off items primarily result from a higher write-down of the investment in the Atlante Funds, on some participations and Deferred Tax Assets for temporary differences and extraordinary contributions to the National Resolution Fund. As a result, the 2016 Group\u2019s estimated net financial result is expected to record a loss of approximately \u20ac11.8bn. Unicredit\u2019s shares fell 5.45% on the news, helping drag the Stoxx 600 Banking Index down 1.68%. Despite the slump in markets following Trump\u2019s travel ban, most are still within reach of record highs. But Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary, has told Bloomberg TV he is concerned about the recent rises in markets: What I think is a clear error, is to confuse several months of strong markets, with strong fundamentals. The period post-election when markets did best in the twentieth century was the period between Herbert Hoover\u2019s election and his inauguration. And of course, as a presidency, that was the biggest economic disaster that we had. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next in markets, but nobody should be serene just because markets are behaving well. On the Trump ban he said he was not surprised that the technology sector has spoken out against it: As global businesses, they have a huge stake in the United States being a nation of the Statue of Liberty rather than being a nation of refugee camps and barbed wire. They have a huge stake in the United States supporting an open and tolerant global system, they have that stake for their employees, they have it for their customers, they have it for the reputation of the United States and they have spoken out. And on chief executives being threatened by the prospect of Trump tweeting against their companies, he said: I\u2019m sure most of them share the values of inclusion, the values of American tradition that were reflected in the statements that John McCain and Lindsey Graham made, the statements that Jeff Immelt made. And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if others don\u2019t have those values or whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if they are being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet. But it\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week. That is an extraordinary change in what the United States is about. Back with the markets, and the Dow\u2019s fall back below 20,000, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: In what is a fairly significant development the Dow Jones opened under 20000 this Monday, causing the Trump travel ban losses to increase across the board. The Dow plunged by 150 points after the bell, US investors equally unhappy with the instability brought on by Trump\u2019s actions as their European cousins. Now, the fact that a potentially March rate-hike signalling Fed meeting looms on Wednesday, alongside the first Trump-era non-farm jobs report on Friday, may have something to do with the Dow\u2019s losses. However, there is no doubt that the main catalyst for the drop has been the Muslim travel ban executive order from the President, not for moral reasons that have caused outrage elsewhere but instead the potential ramifications it could have for trade from the Middle East and elsewhere. With the Dow dipping below its landmark 20000 level there was no reason for the European indices to change tack this afternoon. The FTSE maintained a 0.8% decline as the day went on, keeping the UK index at a 2017 low despite the pound\u2019s own slide against the dollar and euro. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, gradually saw their losses intensify after the US open; the German and French indices are now both down 1.1%. Still with housing, but moving to Ireland, and credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s predicts that Irish house prices could rise by 5% this year. Henry McDonald adds: The number of homeowners in the Republic who are trapped in negative equity or have fallen behind in their mortgage repayments has also dropped dramatically, Moody\u2019s say. In their new year analysis of the Irish housing market, which was one of the main factors contributing to Ireland\u2019s economic collapse towards national bankruptcy in the recession, the Moody\u2019s report found that negative equity in the Republic is \u201cstill high.\u201d However, Moody\u2019s have found that the number of borrowers in arrears or negative equity has fallen from its peak in 2013 to one third of all homeowners. In the aftermath of the financial crash, almost two-thirds of Irish homeowners were exposed to mortgage arrears or negative equity. Its report also forecasts a supply shortage in new or available homes which will fuel rising house prices in the state. Overall Moody\u2019s projects that rising house prices and few mortgage arrears will continue to spread to Irish banks and their bonds which are backed up by home loans According to the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation there are 35,000 home owners in the Republic who have been in mortgage arrears for over two years. Signs of strength in the US housing market. Pending home sales rebounded in December after a decline the previous month, with the National Association of Realtors\u2019 index rising by 1.6% to 109. Analysts had been expecting a 1% increase. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: Pending sales rebounded last month as enough buyers fended off rising mortgage rates and alarmingly low inventory levels1 to sign a contract. The main storyline in the early months of 2017 will be if supply can meaningfully increase to keep price growth at a moderate enough level for households to absorb higher borrowing costs. Sales will struggle to build on last year\u2019s strong pace if inventory conditions don\u2019t improve. The news has done little for the market, where investors are more worried about the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. Unsurprisingly given the chaos and uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban and the falls it has caused in Asian and European markets, Wall Street has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 0.66% or 130 points to 19,963 - below the 20,000 barrier it struggled for so long to achieve. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.41% lower and the Nasdaq Composite 0.46%. Losses were not confined to one particular sector but spread across the board. In the UK market, one of the day\u2019s big risers is engineering and consultancy group WS Atkins. Its shares have jumped more than 7% following a report in the Times (\u00a3) that US peer CH2M had approached the group about a possible merger. Atkins - which has partnered the US group on projects - is not commenting, but analysts at Liberum said the idea was credible: A response from Atkins in relation to the rumoured merger with CH2M is possible in the next day. A merger would almost double the size of the current business and would have more than 50% sales to the US. The business would be particularly strong in Energy, Water and Transportation. We believe that speculation is credible given the industry trend towards consolidation and would potentially create a top 5 global design company. Although the history of M&amp;A is chequered in the sector, we see the potential combination as an early cycle play on growth in US infrastructure. CH2M\u2019s third quarter trading update indicated lower earnings year on year. CH2M has had a challenging time but the suggested valuation of $2bn appears to be a reasonable market cap. The enterprise value is significantly higher, given debt, preference shares, pensions, and perhaps joint venture liabilities. The pension will be a key factor although liabilities have reduced post a controversial deal with the PPF. Premature to assess value creation, but expect limited cost-savings and an interesting debate on revenue synergies. Atkins has already said it is hoping to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure spending plans. Back with the German inflation figures, and despite consumer prices increasing by 1.9% year on year in January, that does not mean the ECB should rein in its stimulus programme, says economist Dr Andreas Rees at UniCredit: Four weeks ago when the December figure was released, there was an outcry by some media and politicians about rising inflation risks in Germany. The ECB should act by unwinding QE as quickly as possible before it is too late, so the story went. It is likely that you will read such statements once again even the latest headline inflation figure came in a tad below expectations. In our view, this kind of thinking is not based on economic facts for two reasons. First, there are no signs of a persistent upward trend in consumer prices. Instead, it is largely about oil. Second, German private households\u2019 inflation expectations remained well anchored. Let us state the obvious: Rising inflation at the turn of the year has primarily been caused by energy prices, or more precisely by the higher oil price. The latest driver was the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia at the end of November to curb output. It was the first agreement of a global oil cartel since 2001. According to our calculations based on federal states data, inflation excluding food and energy was up a more moderate 1.4% year on year after 1.5% in the previous month.... More important, the latest inflation excitement in the media and by some policymakers has been crying wolf as flagged by forward-looking surveys. Private households do not anticipate any surging inflation which goes beyond the energy rise. As a matter of fact, inflation expectations of Germans for the next 12 months hit its trough in spring of last year and rose since then, pretty much in line with what one would expect in the light of the oil price increase. The latest inflation expectations survey for January (conducted by the EU Commission) shows that they still remained below its long-term average. In other words, the allegedly so inflation averse Germans have noticed higher fuel price at the gas stations but they are not really concerned for good reason. Going forward, we expect further rising inflation rates in a range of 2\u00bc%-2\u00bd% year on year for the next three months or so before a stabilisation is kicking in. It will be all about the oil price ... whose effects (on a year on year basis) will be fizzling out in the further course of 2017. On average, we expect +1.8% in consumer prices this year after +0.5% in 2016. There\u2019s no sign of a recovery in the European stock markets: FXTM\u2019s vice president of market research, Jameel Ahmad, says the turmoil caused by the Trump administration in the last few days is to blame. Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the US. What if someone now reacts by banning US products, or even worse US nationals from entering their nations? What if investors now decide to take money out of US funds? Over one million Britons have already reacted by signing a petition to stop an upcoming visit from Trump to the United Kingdom, something that will put even more pressure on Theresa May as she has not only just concluded a meeting with the new President but is already under pressure to meet her own deadline to invoke Article 50 within the next two months. Although it is expected and understood that the UK will be aiming to strengthen relationships around the world following the result of the EU Referendum, I am unsure how people will react to Theresa May strengthening a relationship with the United States that appears on track to isolate itself from globalisation. Fresh US consumer spending figures show that the American public kept spending last month. Consumer spending rose by 0.5% in December, up from +0.2% in November, suggesting the economy ended 2016 in solid shape. The report also shows inflation picking up; the Personal Consumption Expenditure index (a measure of the cost of living), jumped to 1.6%, or 1.7% if volatile factors like food and energy are excluded. The jump in German inflation to 1.9% this month will intensify the pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in its stimulus programme. The ECB is currently keeping interest rates at 0%, charging banks which leave money with them, and buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate debt each month with newly created money. With German inflation on the brink of 2%, Berlin will argue that the ECB needs to tighten policy now - even though prices are rising more modestly in other countries. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, says Germany\u2019s \u2018bogeyman\u2019 has returned. But we\u2019re not back in the 1920s yet..... As Brzeski puts it The common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown. First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low... Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Newsflash: Inflation in Germany has hit its highest level since July 2013, in the latest sign that the cost of living is picking up in Europe. Germany\u2019s Consumer Prices Index jumped to 1.9% in January, according to flash estimates, up from 1.7% in December. Some economists had expected it to hit 2% - just over the official target for inflation across the eurozone. There are also signs today that the eurozone debt crisis is bubbling up. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek two-year bonds has jumped from 6.8% to 8.6% today. That means investors are keen to offload the debt, following the IMF\u2019s warning that Greece needs substantial debt relief. Shares in several travel companies have fallen today. Air France-KLM are down 2.2%, IAG (parent company of British Airways) have lost 1.2% and InterContinental Hotels are 1.6% lower. They would all suffer if the global economy slows, or enters an era of greater protectionism. Insurance group AXA UK has pledged to will honour claims from customers affected by Trump\u2019s travel clampdown - even though they\u2019re not technically covered for such disruption. Here\u2019s the official statement: \u201cIn light of the sudden and unexpected decision by the Trump administration to block entry to the US for nationals from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen, AXA Insurance UK confirms that individuals who have been denied entry as a result of the executive order, will be able to claim on their policy. Although not technically covered, we view the current situation as unprecedented and unforeseen and as such we are extending the cover under our policies. For those intending to travel to, or return from, the United States of America we recommend allowing extra time due to protests currently taking place at a number of airports.\u201d European stock markets remain in the red as lunchtime approaches, with the German, French and UK indices all down around 0.8%. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson says the US president\u2019s ban visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen is causing alarm. Global Indices have started on the back foot this morning, after US President Trump announced one of his most radical policies yet, in the form of a travel ban. The resulting press criticism and mass protests appear to have pushed some investors to the sidelines as rising uncertainty in the ability of the President not to cause damage to the US economy starts to increase, and uncertainty rarely bodes well for financial markets. Bloomberg has flagged up that the tech industry has particular reasons to worry about Trump: A glimmer of good news; economic confidence across the euro area has hit its highest level in almost six years. The EC\u2019s Economic Sentiment Indicator, which tracks business and consumer confidence, has jumped to 108.2 from 107.8 in December, the best reading since March 2011. But with Trump causing anxiety worldwide, and crunch elections in Germany and France this year, can confidence hold up? Only a handful of the 100 companies on the blue-chip Footsie index have risen this morning; the rest have been dragged down by concerns over Trump\u2019s policies. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the FTSE 100 is \u2018floundering\u2019 this morning, as it sheds 60 points to its lowest level of 2017. Friday\u2019s dour finish across US markets seems to have paved the way for this morning\u2019s weak trade, with markets turning their focus away from Donald Trump\u2019s business friendly measures and towards his more controversial decision to ban citizens and refugees from seven states in the Middle East and Africa. As we enter February, we are due the typical raft of economic data, with the Bank of England\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 and Friday\u2019s US jobs report meaning that volatility is expected to grow as the week progresses. UK public anger about Trump\u2019s actions continues to build; one million people have now signed the petition opposing him receiving a state visit. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in five hours time. The futures market indicates the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 40-ish points to around 20053, having hit record highs last week. Remo Fritschi, institutional Sales Manager at ADS Securities in London, believes Trump\u2019s refugee clampdown could spur a burst of profit-taking on Wall Street. Wall Street is looking at a softer start to the week as questions begin to mount over just how damaging the new US immigration policy will be to a number of multinational businesses. Sweeping bans on admission to the country from a number of nations risks undermining the globalisation agenda that has helped pump valuations in a range of US-listed stocks over the last few years, whilst the prospect of similar restrictions being applied to US citizens could also hamper overseas trade initiatives. Back in the eurozone, Spain\u2019s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.7% in October-December, matching the growth rate in the previous three months. It means Spain grew by 3.2% in 2016, the third year of growth since its recession during the euro debt crisis. Reminder, we get more eurozone GDP data on Tuesday. Paul Donovan, economist at UBS, has warned clients that investors in the Middle East could pull money out of America, if they feel Trump is persecuting Muslims. European stock markets are all in retreat this morning, as the US travel ban hits sentiment across the continent. The share price rally sparked by Trump\u2019s shock election win in November has now fizzled out; the FTSE 100 is now in the red for 2017. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Pretty much everything slipped into the red this morning, the markets reacting to the fresh bout of instability brought on by Donald Trump over the weekend. Though the Trump rally may have lifted the markets to their current peaks, the global outrage that has greeted the President\u2019s first week in office, the most recent instance being the well-placed disgust at his Muslim travel ban, is now beginning suppress investors\u2019 appetites especially since, as mentioned, the indices are trading so high. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, says Trump is creating \u201cmore uncertainty and jitters among investors.\u201d The major US tech giants have also strongly condemned the president\u2019s executive order which is not helping business confidence. Starbucks, the US coffee giant, announced today that they will hire 10,000 refuges over the next 5 years, sending a clear message to Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant and biased policies. You could certainly say that the tourism sector over in the US might also feel the pinch as holidaying stateside is not an ideal scenario for visitors in light of his new anti-immigration policies. After a blizzard of executive orders on immigration, border control, oil pipelines and trade, it\u2019s becoming clear that Trump actually means what he said during last year\u2019s campaign. This may be an unwelcome shock to investors who hoped the billionaire would take a different path once in office. James Woods, global investment analyst at Rivkin Securities in Sydney, explains (via Reuters): \u201cTrump always stated these were policies he would implement. \u201cQuite a lot of it was brushed off as \u2018campaign rhetoric\u2019 but he is following through. \u201cThis renews concerns about a trade war with China that would significantly affect both Asian and the global economy.\u201d Stock markets and the US dollar are both starting the week on the back foot, as Donald Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban worries investors. Shares have fallen in Asia, amid fears that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt the US economy, and trigger a new phase of protectionism. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.5%, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX index shed almost 1%. European stock markets are under pressure too, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 dropping by 55 points, or 0.75%, to 7129 in early trading. The US dollar also retreated against the Japanese yen, dropping by 0.2% to \u00a5114.88. The selloff comes after Trump imposed a 90-day ban on citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen travelling to the US, and temporarily halted America\u2019s refugee programme. The move has sparked heavy criticism around the globe, and protests in several American cities. In Britain, a petition against Trump being granted a state visit to Britain has already attracted almost one million signatures. Financial analysts are concerned that the backlash against Trump\u2019s plans could have serious economic consequences. Stephen Innes, a senior trader at OANDA, summed the situation up well: \u201cWorld leaders were quick to condemn President Trump\u2019s executive order to ban U.S. travel from seven Muslim countries. The global reaction has been one of universal condemnation. The fear here is that the market may start to think that personal vendetta is clouding the Oval Office judgment and they could express a huge vote of non-confidence through the markets. \u201cThe increase in civil unrest alone should be a concern for investors, and with a lack of clarity on the economic policy front, markets will be cantankerous early in the week as they\u2019re completely uncertain of what\u2019s next from President Trump on the geopolitical landscape.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This is going to be a big week for news, with European growth data being released, two key central bank meetings, and a new healthcheck on America\u2019s jobs market. On Tuesday, we get new eurozone GDP figures showing how the currency bloc fared in the last three months of 2016, plus euro inflation data for January. Wednesday brings a Federal Reserve meeting; the US central bank isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates, but could hint at a hike in March. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: On Thursday the Bank of England will announce its interest rate decision, and publish its quarterly inflation report. With inflation picking up, the BoE could face pressure to raise rates sooner than expected. Finally, Friday will bring the latest US jobs data, in the Non-Farm Payroll report. That will show if America\u2019s labour market is slowing down, after years of solid growth under Barack Obama. Coming up today.... The week starts with new inflation figures from Germany, at 1pm GMT, and America at 1.30pm GMT. Economists predict that Germany\u2019s inflation rate may have risen to 2% in January, slightly over the eurozone\u2019s target, and ahead of other European countries. German politicians are already anxious that the European Central Bank is too relaxed about the rising cost of living, so today\u2019s data could fuel that debate. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: The consensus call is that the German inflation rate rose to 2% y/y in January, in line with the ECB\u2019s own target with the likelihood that the rate will rise further in coming months which will likely see further public calls from Germany policy makers and commentators for the ECB to begin to consider normalising policy. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Greece, as talks with its creditors drag on. Experts fear trouble ahead unless the latest phase of Athens\u2019 bailout is signed off by 20 February. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The fallout of Trump\u2019s ban on travel, his firing of the acting attorney general, followed by the attack on the euro and Germany by his top trade advisor, have all added to the mood of growing uncertainty. Some unimpressive updates have not helped.

But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. <br></p> <p>Speaking on Skai TV this morning, <strong>Nikos Xydakis</strong>, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, <strong>Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou</strong> similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. </p> <p>In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner <strong>Anna Diamantopoulou</strong> demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5890a055e4b0e481c6e49340\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T14:45:18.089Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b0e8abd8cc2dadf6c5f896ba4e0e1607a8f8a665\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e8abd8cc2dadf6c5f896ba4e0e1607a8f8a665/0_0_2748_3802/723.jpg\" alt=\"The Wall Street sign and the front of the New York Stock Exchange in New York.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders.</p> <p><strong>FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States.</p> <p>While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58909bd1e4b0f1550c0dadaf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T14:22:51.370Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6091f3cd41e80f374a3d4863f91429f86a3b468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6091f3cd41e80f374a3d4863f91429f86a3b468/0_0_5072_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sweden\u2019s Prime minister Stefan Lofven giving a press conference in Stockholm today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sweden\u2019s Prime minister Stefan Lofven giving a press conference in Stockholm today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/31/eurozone-gdp-french-economy-grows-unemployment-germany-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-58907897e4b0b3e971af5115#block-58907897e4b0b3e971af5115\"> Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism:</a></strong></p> <p>Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed.</p> <p> \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The new US administration has opened up a new front against Europe, accusing Germany of unfairly profiting from the \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro. Peter Navarro, who heads up Donald Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, made the comments in an FT interview today. The comments sent the euro spiking; it\u2019s now at its highest level since November. But German chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to rebuff the comments, saying that Germany can\u2019t control the value of the euro anyway. New data has shown that Europe\u2019s economy continues to recover -- and that price pressures are building. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, new data shows, meaning that it grew faster last year than America. Inflation is also on the rise; the consumer prices index jumped by 1.8% year-on-year. But the increase was mainly due to energy prices, with core inflation remaining at 0.9%. There was also relief that the eurozone jobless rate fell again, to 9.6% in December. But the divisions in Europe were clear to see - with Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hitting a post-reunification low, while Italy\u2019s remains at the highest since July 2015. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Greece\u2019s deadlocked talks with creditors have once more raised the spectre of Grexit. And back across the Atlantic, US consumer confidence dropped in January from the fifteen year high seen in December. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite a busy day for economic and corporate news, the actions of the Trump administration were once again at the forefront of investors minds. The fallout of Trump\u2019s ban on travel, his firing of the acting attorney general, followed by the attack on the euro and Germany by his top trade advisor, have all added to the mood of growing uncertainty. Some unimpressive updates have not helped. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said A double whammy in the form of misses for the Chicago PMI and consumer confidence on the economic front, plus a poor set of numbers from economic bellwether UPS, have resulted in a continuation of yesterday\u2019s risk-off atmosphere. Only in London is the mood more optimistic, where once again it is the FTSE\u2019s mining contingent that is helping to [support] the index. In the end the FTSE also succumbed to the negative mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.27% or 19.33 points at 7099.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.25% to 11,535.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% lower at 4748.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.9% to 18,590.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.49% lower at 9315.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.38% to 611.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 138 points or 0.7%. It\u2019s probably no surprise that market volatility is on the rise after the first few days of the Trump presidency. And after a dip on Monday it is back up again: Despite the drop in US consumer confidence, it is still at fairly high levels. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Although slightly down on last month\u2019s historic high US consumer confidence remains strong in the face of uncertainty. The US economy is enjoying robust numbers at the moment and Fed Chair Janet Yellen will likely be inching closer to the first of three possible interest rate rises this year. American citizens appear to be confident in the potential growth of business conditions, stock prices and jobs. However, the world\u2019s largest economy is now being steered by an unpredictable new leader in the form of Donald Trump and the year ahead could still be bumpy. That didn\u2019t last long... US consumer confidence has dropped, having spiked in the aftermath of the US election victory. America\u2019s Conference Board reports that its consumer confidence index dipped to 111.8 this month, down from the fifteen-year high struck in December. Over to Greece where deadlocked talks with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat have once again raised the spectre of Grexit and the need for contingency plans. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: It is a scenario that in the ranks of Syriza, the governing left-wing party, no one openly wants. But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. Speaking on Skai TV this morning, Nikos Xydakis, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d \u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked. Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting. \u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015. \u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901. Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that: Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States. While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment. Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism: Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said: \u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed. \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is.\u201d City experts aren\u2019t convinced by Peter Navarro\u2019s comments about the euro: Here\u2019s former UBS chief economist George Magnus: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets: Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye Risk Management, is even less impressed: Newsflash: German chancellor Angela Merkel has responded to Peter Navarro\u2019s attack. She says that Germany cannot influence the value of the euro, and that the country has always pushed for the European Central Bank to be independent. Does Peter Navarro have a point, when he claims Germany is exploiting other countries through its cheap currency? Well.... Germany posted a record trade surplus in 2015, and will probably do the same when 2016\u2019s numbers are added up. Cheap currencies boost exports, and no-one would argue that the euro would be more valuable if you removed the weaker members from the currency bloc. Back in 2015, former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke blogged that the German trade surplus was \u201ca problem\u201d for the global economy. He argued that Berlin should boost government spending, and workers\u2019 wages, to help drive it down. However.... Bernanke also pointed out that Germany has little control over the value of the euro. It has fallen near to parity with the US dollar because the European Central Bank has slashed interest rates to record lows (unpopular in Germany), imposed negative rates on banks (unpopular in Germany) and created tens of billions of euros to buy government bonds (unpopular in Germany). Currency wars aren\u2019t a new issue either. NBC correspondent Hans Nichols points out that the Obama administration had its own concerns about the euro, when it was stronger: The prospect of a currency spat between the US and the eurozone has pushed the euro up against all major currencies. The single currency is up 0.7% against the dollar now, to $1.0764, after Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed it was \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d. This means the US dollar is still on track to post its worst January since 2008 (as recorded earlier). The euro has also gained 0.6% against the pound to 86.1p, meaning one pound is worth \u20ac1.1608. Peter Navarro\u2019s attack on Germany over the euro shows that the Trump administration are concerned about countries who run a trade surplus with the US. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Citigroup global econonomics director Ebrahim Rahbari says that \u201ctalking about a currency is much easier than taking specific measures\u201d. Currency rates have clearly been under discussion for some time, at forums such as the G20, Rahbari points out. So Navarro is \u201cratcheting up the discussions that have previously taken place\u201d, he concludes. Hold onto your hats, folks. The Financial Times is reporting that one of Donald Trump\u2019s advisers has hit out at Germany, saying it gets an unfair advantage due to the weakness of the euro. Here\u2019s the story, by the FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan: Germany is using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to exploit the US and its EU partners, Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser has said in comments that are likely to trigger alarm in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Peter Navarro, the head of Mr Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, told the Financial Times the euro was like an \u201cimplicit Deutsche Mark\u201d whose low valuation gave Germany an advantage over its main partners. His views suggest the new administration is focusing on currency as part of its hard-charging approach on trade ties. In a departure from past US policy, Mr Navarro also called Germany one of the main hurdles to a US trade deal with the EU and declared talks with the bloc over a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership dead. Here\u2019s the full story: Trump\u2019s top trade adviser accuses Germany of currency exploitation The euro is now rising sharply against the US dollar, as traders anticipate action from Washington over this issue. It\u2019s gained almost 0.5% to \u20ac1.074. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the news that eurozone growth and inflation have risen, while the unemployment rate has hit a new seven-year low. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: In the Eurozone GDP figures have been released this morning. Inflation in Spain has increased to 3% as has the cost of living in France, up by 1.4%; while the broader EU CPI measure jumped to 1.8% largely driven by a jump in energy prices. The French economy grew 1.1% in 2016 slightly less than expected but despite this Michel Sapin, the French minister of finance, insisted the French economy is still moving in the right direction and reducing unemployment. Overall, Eurozone GDP came in at 0.5% for the last quarter which was better than forecast and unemployment fell. All this positive data suggests the Eurozone is recovering slowly, though Italy continues to remain a weak point. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity: Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, A fresh and intricate new conundrum has reared its ugly head for Mario Draghi this morning as the pressure of a significant uplift in German inflation has pushed the Eurozone figure up to 1.8% for January. The renown \u2018powerhouse\u2019 of the Eurozone is now putting significant pressure on the ECB President as euro-sceptics are quickly pointing out that stimulus measures are falling far short of creating a balanced and improved bloc state. Whilst GDP saw an uplift this morning, as well as a diminishing Unemployment rate also posted, inflation has, and will be for the foreseeable future, the focus. With such wild swings upwards, Draghi will have to adopt Monetary policy accordingly, which at present isn\u2019t hugely clear as to what path he should, or is willing to take. Many analysts suggest Quantitative Easing is falling far short of improving the economic situation, and Draghi always notes \u2018other tools\u2019 which he can, and will adopt - perhaps now is the time for him to lay his cards on the table, so to speak. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: The ECB has been wont to point out that core inflation remains a problem and the uptick in prices might not last. And again this remains stubbornly below the headline figure at just 0.9%. No cause for the ECB to tighten monetary policy just yet but refreshingly upbeat figures nonetheless. The data is improving in Europe but there is as yet no sign of anything other than monetary policy divergence between the Fed and European Central Bank. Greece\u2019s debt problems won\u2019t go away and political risks are abundant. The eurozone didn\u2019t manage to match Britain\u2019s economy, though. UK GDP grew by 0.6% in the last three months of 2016, and by 2.2% during the year. The eurozone outperformed the United States last year. Today\u2019s growth figures show that the eurozone expanded by 1.8% in 2016; last Friday, we learned that America only grew by 1.6%. This is the first time the Eurozone has grown faster than the US in a calendar year since 2008, when the financial crisis struck. Eurozone politicians will be delighted to see the region\u2019s jobless rate fall to 9.6% (not 9.8% as I mistyped earlier, sorry). This is the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. The jobless rate across the European Union came in at 8.2%, unchanged from November, and the lowest since February 2009. The lowest rates were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany, while Greece suffered the worst jobless rate (23.0% in October 2016) followed by Spain (18.4%). There are still 20.065 million men and women out of work in the EU, including 15.571 million in the euro area. And young people are still finding it hard to find work; in December 2016, the youth unemployment rate was 18.6% in the EU28 and 20.9% in the euro area, compared with 19.5% and 21.8% respectively in December 2015. Important point: eurozone core inflation (which strips out food and energy) was only 0.9% this month, rather than the headline figure of 1.8%. That\u2019s little comfort to households facing a cash squeeze, but it does give the European Central Bank a good reason not to be bounced into changing monetary policy. Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, explains: \u201cHeadline inflation is clearly picking up in the Eurozone, but a lot of that is linked to energy price base effects (+8.1% compared with +2.6% in December). As highlighted in their most recent press conference, the ECB itself is willing to look through these transient gains. As such, we believe that it is too early to call for any sort of further \u201ctapering\u201d in the region, especially ahead of a very busy political agenda. Growth up, inflation up, unemployment down.... On an annual basis, the eurozone grew by 1.8% last year - up from 1.5% in 2015. My Reuters machine is gasping for air as a burst of newsflashes ripple out from the eurozone, giving new insights into the European economy. New growth figures show that the euro area grew by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, suggesting the region\u2019s recovery is picking up pace. But inflation has jumped by more than expected, to 1.8% in January. That\u2019s the highest in almost four-years, driven by a steep rise in energy prices. The European Central Bank\u2019s target is to keep inflation just below 2% - these figures are surely going to fuel calls for the ECB to stop its bond-buying stimulus programme, and consider pushing interest rates up. And the unemployment rate across the region has dropped to 9.6% in December  , a new seven-year low. Details and reaction to follow.... The latest unemployment news from Italy is rather disappointing. The Italian jobless rate came in at 12% in December, higher than expected, while November\u2019s reading has been revised up from 11.9% to 12%. These are the highest readings since July 2015. The US dollar is poised to suffer its worst start to any year since 2008. The greenback has fallen by 1.9% against a basket of currencies this month, partly thanks to yesterday\u2019s selloff as Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders alarmed traders. The pound, for example, has gained over 1.5 cents against the US dollar this month, from $1.233 to $1.25. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says it\u2019s very hard to know how the markets will react to Trump. President Trump\u2019s travel ban - and his associated decision to fire the acting Attorney General - dominates sentiment and remains good for Treasuries, the yen (and gold), but bad for bonds and the dollar. How long will market sentiment to be affected? How far can the dollar and yields fall on this? I\u2019m not sure serious analysis is possible, and I don\u2019t trust my gut instincts on something as far from the usual state of affairs, but my bias is still that we\u2019ll get back to the Trump economic program, and the implications for Fed policy, before too long. More prosaically, markets will focus on the US jobs data due Friday. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s jobs market remains as strong as ever. The unemployment total in Europe\u2019s largest economy has fallen again this month, by 26,000 people, to 2.605m. That takes Germany\u2019s jobless rate down to 5.9%. UK online supermarket group Ocado is the best performing stock across Europe, jumping by 6.5%. It posted a 21% jump in pre-tax profits this morning, to \u00a314.5m, and told shareholders it was busier than ever, in its long-running attempt to sign an overseas deal. The only problem is that we\u2019ve been waiting YEARS for Ocado to team up with an international partner. The company insists there are plenty of suiters in the wings, but there\u2019s still no actual agreement. Retail analyst Nick Bubb predicts: Management will have to put up with more questions from the City today about the failure to deliver an Overseas deal in the analysts meeting at 9.30am\u2026 European stock markets have opened nervously, following those losses in Asia overnight. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has inched up by 0.2%, while the French CAC and German DAX are both flat. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says investors are juggling political and economic concerns right now. It\u2019s been an interesting start to the week, with protests against President Trump\u2019s immigration ban dominating market news and reaction. Trump\u2019s use of executive power has not stopped with immigration; on Monday he signed a new order that will cap business regulation. While politics took centre stage at the start of the week, earnings from Apple and Exxon on later today, along with a flurry of central bank meetings this week will be critical for determining what matters more to markets right now: politics or economics. Back to GDP....and Austria has posted another quarter of solid growth. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, matching the (upwardly revised) growth in July-September. Austria\u2019s statistics body said that consumer spending and investment were the main factors behind the growth, as in France. Newsflash: Inflation in Spain has surged this month, to 3% on an EU-harmonised basis. The cost of living in France has accelerated too, jumping from 0.8% to 1.6% . The rises are mainly due to higher energy prices, and it suggests the eurozone inflation rate, due in two hour\u2019s time, has also risen sharply this month. If so, there\u2019ll be a lot more pressure on the European Central Bank to consider tightening its stimulus programme, especially from Germany (where inflation jumped to 1.9%, according to figures released on Monday). Asian stock markets have had another poor day, as fears about Donald Trump\u2019s actions continue to rile investors. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 1.7%, its biggest drop since October, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.7%. On Monday, global markets suffered their biggest one-day drop in six weeks, amid global condemnation of the US president\u2019s travel ban on seven countries in the Middle East. The news that Trump had fired attorney general Sally Yates after she instructed lawyers not to defend the ban has added to the nervous mood, and fears that Trump is destabilising the world order. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says (via Reuters): Investors are becoming worried as it appears as if he was setting fire to geopolitical risks that already exist. We don\u2019t have any growth figures from Germany today. Instead, we\u2019ve got a nasty fall in retail spending. German retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in December, dashing hopes of a recovery after a 1.7% drop in November. These figures are often volatile, but it could suggest consumers in Europe\u2019s largest economy were cautious in the run-up to Christmas. Outgoing French president Francois Hollande will surely be pleased that the economy is growing, but his successor still faces a big challenge: German journalist Gesche W\u00fcpper points out that France\u2019s growth during 2016 was weaker than hoped, at just 1.1% for the year. Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets this graph, showing how France\u2019s growth has been volatile and unspectacular over the last few years: Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group, shows how France (in green) has lagged behind Sweden, the US, Germany and the UK over the last decade. France has got Eurozone GDP Day off to a good start, by reporting that its economy accelerated in the last three months of 2016. French GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December quarter, twice as fast as in July-September. This suggests that France\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis continues, despite the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote last summer. The figures also show that France\u2019s economy grew by 1.1% during 2016. Statistics body INSEE says that consumer and business spending drove the recovery. \u201cHousehold consumption expenditures\u201d rose by 0.6% during the month. while \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d jumped by 0.8%. Exports were \u201cmore dynamic\u201d, rising by +1.1% during the quarter while imports grew by 0.8%. And that means foreign trade balance contributed slightly to GDP growth: +0.1 points after \u22120.7 points in the previous quarter. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be looking at Europe\u2019s economy this morning, as new data are released showing how the eurozone is performing. The first estimate of eurozone GDP for the last quarter of 2016, due at 10am GMT, may show that growth picked up to +0.4%, from +0.3%. We\u2019ll also get some figures from individual countries, including France. The latest eurozone unemployment figures are also due at 10am GMT; economists reckon the jobless rate will stick at 9.8% again, the lowest since 2009. But Italy\u2019s figures, due at 9am GMT, will surely show that its recovery is lagging behind. Plus, the latest estimate of eurozone inflation is released (yup, also at 10am GMT). We also get German retail sales figures for December at 7am; they\u2019re expected to bounce back by around 0.6% after shrinking by 1.8% in November. And at 8am, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving speech on \u201cInto the future: Europe\u2019s digital integrated market\u201d in Frankfurt, Germany. Europe\u2019s financial markets are expected to be subdued, following yesterday\u2019s losses as investors watched the backlash against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day...",
