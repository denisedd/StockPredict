                "bodyText":"While the FTSE 100 was breaking new records, European markets were more subdued but still managed to end the day in positive territory, for the most part. The final scores showed: Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.17% to 11,583.30 France\u2019s Cac closed up just 0.01% at 4888.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.33% to 19,424.19 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9452.0 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 42 points or 0.2% at 19,929, heading back towards the 20,000 barrier. Meanwhile after its recent falls, the pound is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2160 and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1511. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high for the ninth day running, breaking a record which has stood for nearly 20 years. The index finished up 0.53% at a new peak of 7275.47, bettering the eight day winning streak recorded in May 1997 as Tony Blair\u2019s Labour won the general election. The FTSE 250 has closed at 18,413, also a record high. As markets continue to climb - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in positive territory and just under 60 points away from the 20,000 level - Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE 100 has again had an outstanding day, with the index gaining from the first minute to the last as it reached new all-time highs once more. The fact that we are seeing the index hit these new highs in such a fearless manner says a lot about the potential for further gains. Interestingly we have seen both [President elect] Trump and [UK prime minister} May providing positive news for the respective US and UK indices, yet for very different reasons. While Trump has boosted US stocks by setting out a positive outlook for the future, the strength of the FTSE has been largely down to the pound devaluation associated with fears over a hard Brexit outcome. Back with the markets, and the FTSE 100 is well on course to break two records - a new closing peak and the longest run of closing highs. With a winning streak of nine consecutive end-of-day peaks, this would beat the previous record set in May 1997. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the pound still at 2 month to 10 week lows (even if it did manage to shrink much of today\u2019s losses), the miners boosted by data from China [factory gate inflation] and the supermarkets led higher by Morrisons impressive Christmas performance the FTSE has plenty of support this Tuesday..[This] sees the index set to break the record for most consecutive days of new all-time closing highs, a record that has lasted for just shy of 20 years. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is giving a speech on Brexit and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering it in the politics live blog: As investors await the US reporting season to see if company results justify the heady heights the stock market has reached, leading shares have edged lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came perilously close to the elusive 20,000 barrier on Friday, has shied further away from that level. It is currently down 27 points or 0.13% at 19,860. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both slipped marginally at the open. Back in the markets, the pound has pulled out of today\u2019s slide and is now flat against the US dollar at $1.217. It\u2019s still down slightly against the euro though, at \u20ac1.149. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the recovery could be temporary... Monday was a bit like Deja-Vu for currency traders, and a keen reminder of how politics can play havoc with a currency. Sterling declined to its lowest level since October as political fears and the Brexit premium started to bite. The pound has managed to claw back some losses on Tuesday, but it remains at risk from a further decline in sentiment. This year\u2019s Davos will certainly be different, thanks to the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Attendees will be pondering whether populist forces will triumph in elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands this year, and president Trump\u2019s views on climate change, financial regulation and global inequality. So it\u2019s no surprise that Klaus Schwab, who created WEF decades ago, is no fan of populism. But, of course, those \u2018populist\u2019 forces are no fans of Davos either! CNBC\u2019s Matt Clinch has a good take: In a nod to this current mood, this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (WEF) is titled \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership\u201d and its official agenda describes a \u201cweakening of multiple systems\u201d that has eroded confidence and speaks of a possible \u201cdownward spiral\u201d fuelled by protectionism, populism and nativism. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as U.S. president on January 20 will overshadow the event but it\u2019s hard to see how every conference, bilateral meeting or roundtable in Davos won\u2019t include some reference to this political upheaval, which the conservative news aggregation site The Drudge Report calls the \u201cnew, new world order\u201d. Indeed, some critics have attacked the event itself as being a reason why U.S. citizens started to question globalization and contemplate the negative impacts it\u2019s had on some parts of Western nations. CNBC: The \u2018party of Davos\u2019 wakes up to the new, new world order Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Campbell and Albertina Torsoli agree that China will be one of the big issues at WEF next week. They explain: The most high-profile guest by far will be Chinese president Xi Jinping, the first sitting Chinese leader to attend the event. He\u2019s heading a larger-than-ever delegation of business executives from the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, underscoring China\u2019s determination to assume a global leadership role as other major powers are hobbled by domestic infighting. China\u2019s two richest citizens, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda Group Co. Ltd CEO Wang Jianlin, will join him and appear in solo on-stage interviews. China\u2019s deepening engagement with the world will, meanwhile, be the subject of a discussion on \u201cChina\u2019s Role for Global Prosperity,\u201d in which stock-market regulator Fang Xinghai and state-assets chief Xiao Yaqing will appear alongside Lloyds of London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale. More here: Chinese president Xi\u2019s first visit to Davos, next week, is an important opportunity to strengthen relations between China and the rest of the world, says argues WEF founder Klaus Schwab. Schwab tells the WEF press conference that Xi Jinping will attend with a set of top officials and businesspeople, at a time when its economic power is as important as ever. Since I first visited China in 1979, we have developed a very close relationship, close presence in China. We are all aware that we are now in transition to a multi-polar geo-political and geo-economic structure. China will equal the United States soon for economic power. And I foresee that President Xi will show how China will assume a responsive and responsible leadership role in global affairs. Schwab also reiterates that populism won\u2019t make the world a better place. We are living in a very complex world. All the issues are interrelated.... There are no simple answers to the challenges that we have. So what we have to do in Davos is show how complicated the situation is. Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum are getting ready for their 47th annual meeting, which begins next Monday. A lot has happened around the world since the 46th get-together, and much will have shocked the CEOs, government leaders and other heavy-hitters who trek to the ski resort each year. WEF founder Klaus Schwab and colleagues are holding a pre-meeting press conference now (it\u2019s online here). Schwab says this year\u2019s meeting must make progress towards tackling the world\u2019s problems - and argued that the rising tide of populism isn\u2019t the answer. Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned to fail. We cannot just have populist solutions. The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic approach....and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, united in one mission - improving the state of the world. Schwab also singled out the challenge created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (the new wave of automation and robotics), and pointed out that Chinese premier President Xi Jinping will address Davos for the first time. Over in Italy, two people have been arrested for allegedly hacking into the email accounts of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, former prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, and thousands of others. We don\u2019t know what information was obtained, or what it was used for, but it will only intensify the focus on cybersecurity. Reuters has the details: \u201cThere were tens of thousands of email accounts hacked, and among them were accounts belonging to bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals in the Vatican,\u201d Roberto Di Legami, director of the specialised cyber police unit that conducted the investigation, told Reuters. Police have sequestered a server in Rome containing thousands of files, but 99 percent of the data was stored in the United States, Di Legami said. The information will be shipped back in coming days but it will take some time before it can be analysed. While the FTSE 100 hits fresh highs, the pound is on track for its worst three-day run sin October. Sterling is now down 0.2% at $1.214, adding to Monday\u2019s 1% slide, and keeping it at a 10-week low against the US dollar. It\u2019s also at two-month lows against the euro, down 0.25% at \u20ac1.147. These aren\u2019t big moves, of course, but it does bring the pound rather close to its weakest level against the dollar since the alarming \u2018flash crash\u2019 of early October, which is $1.2080. This chart from City expert David Jones shows how the pound\u2019s rally in November has now unravelled: Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says the uncertainty around Brexit is overshadowing the fact that UK economic data has been better than expected. He writes: \u201cThe pound\u2019s lowly performance this week took a sharper hit, reaching fresh 10-week-lows, owing largely to dimming hopes for a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit. The key issue being the taut stance of EU over free-movement and its effect on the prospects of a single market access deal for the U.K. Selling pressure on the pound is expected to stay until further details are revealed in the coming weeks. On the bright side, the economy is still defying expectations as it continues to persist on the momentum from 2016 and a lower pound has positively affected exports. Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford to increase interest rates anytime in the near future \u2013 such indicators normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole driver of the current narrative.\u201d Incidentally, the FTSE 100 could also set its longest run of daily gains since 2009 today -- as well as the lengthiest stretch of record highs ever. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since it was created in 1984. After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, an new intraday high. Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the last eight days running. It\u2019s gained 8% since the start of December: So if the rally holds, the FTSE 100 will close at a record high for the ninth day running. This would smash the previous record set in 1997 after Tony Blair won a landslide general election victory. Mining companies are now leading the rally, helped by optimism about economic growth next year. The strong Christmas trading figures from Morrison\u2019s are pushing supermarkets shares higher too. Here\u2019s some more snippets from the parliamentary hearing on Brexit and the City, via Financial News\u2019s Lucy McNulty: Over in parliament, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has warned that thousands of City jobs could be lost if the uncertainty around Brexit doesn\u2019t ease. Xavier Rolet told the Treasury committee that LSE clients wouldn\u2019t wait for clarity about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the few thousands. But the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it\u2019s syndication, trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of thousands of jobs. They would then start migrating.\u201d (thanks to Ben Woods of the Press Association for the quotes). HSBC chairman Douglas Flint is also talking about clients\u2019 concerns about Brexit. We\u2019ll have more on this shortly... Food inflation is returning to the UK, and the weak pound is partly to blame. Research group Kantar Worldpanel has reported that grocery prices rose by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first time in just over two years that food prices have gone up. The cost of importing foodstuffs like sugar and chocolate into the UK has risen since sterling slumped against other currencies. And one of the country\u2019s largest food producers, Premier Foods, is now in talks to hike prices. It\u2019s bad news for fans of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia custard and Loyd Grossman\u2019s sauces. City AM reported overnight that Premier was talking to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda due to \u201cgrowing cost pressures from the weaker pound in the wake of the EU referendum\u201d. A spokeswoman has now confirmed that negotations are underway, saying: \u201cThe situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customer. On average we are considering rises around the midsingle digit mark.\u201d The swingometer has been a staple of British current affair since the 1950s. And analysts at HSBC have created their own version, the \u2018Brexometer\u2019 to show whether the City is expecting a hard or soft Brexit. Today\u2019s weakening pound suggests we\u2019re heading towards a rather solid exit (losing full access to the single market, and no longer subject to the free movement of people, capital, goods and services). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx predicts more sterling volatility today: The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn set to deliver a speech claiming the UK can be better off out of the EU meaning it might be another rough day for the pound. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a major speech on Europe today that will outline his vision for Britain after Brexit. Our political editor Anushka Asthana explains: Jeremy Corbyn will use his first speech of 2017 to claim that Britain can be better off outside the EU and insist that the Labour party has no principled objection to ending the free movement of European workers in the UK. Setting out his party\u2019s pitch on Brexit in the year that Theresa May will trigger article 50, the Labour leader will also reach for the language of leave campaigners by promising to deliver on a pledge to spend millions of pounds extra on the NHS every week. He will say Labour\u2019s priority in EU negotiations will remain full access to the European single market, but that his party wants \u201cmanaged migration\u201d and to repatriate powers from Brussels that would allow governments to intervene in struggling industries such as steel. Sources suggested that the economic demands were about tariff-free access to the single market, rather than membership that they argued did not exist. Karl Whelan, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin, tweets that this call for immigration control but full access to the single market seems familiar.... The Financial Times argues today that \u201cexasperation\u201d over Theresa May\u2019s lack of clarity about Brexit are doing the real damage to sterling. Traders aren\u2019t surprised that Britain is likely to leave the single market, to allow new controls on immigration, but they are uncomfortable in the dark waiting for more details. Here\u2019s a flavour: With less than three months to go before the government plans to invoke Article 50 and begin the Brexit process, there is nervousness that the government has yet to reveal a plan. \u201cThere is no clear path and a lack of substance,\u201d said Andrew Soper, head of FX options at Nomura. More here: Traders fret over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit vagueness The pound is continuing to drop. It just hit a new 10-week low of $1.2118 against the US dollar, down another half a cent this morning. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading. The index of the largest companies listed in London gained 23 points, or 0.3%, to hit 7261 points. That\u2019s partly due to the pound\u2019s weakness, which boosts the value of international companies and should help exporters. A strong performance by the supermarket sector is also helping, after Morrisons posted its best sales results in seven years. Morrison\u2019s share are up 4%, with rivals Sainsbury and Tesco close behind. On Monday night the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high for the 8th day in a row. That last happened in 1997 -- a ninth consecutive closing high today would break that record. Despite Theresa May\u2019s best efforts, the pound is under renewed pressure this morning as investors fret about Brexit. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% against the euro to \u20ac1.1466 in early trading, its lowest level since the 10th November. The pound is also a little weaker against the US dollar at $1.2137, adding to Monday\u2019s losses (when it hit a three-month low against the greenback). The PM claimed on Monday that Britain will get the best possible deal from the EU. However, her insistence that the UK can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of membership\u2019 have fuelled worries about a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit (not a term Mrs May approves of), and exit from the single market. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound was \u2018battered\u2019 on Monday. She predicts that investors will keep betting against sterling until they know the details of Brexit. We expect the pound to remain the most volatile of the G10 currencies in the coming months while we wait for the triggering of Article 50. Essentially the market is likely to re-establish shorts in GBP, after a brief respite at the end of last year, until it is quite confident that Brexit won\u2019t be \u2018hard\u2019 or disastrous for the UK economy. While Theresa May says that we can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of the EU\u2019, sterling isn\u2019t safe from the bears until we know what will replace the single market. Any potential recovery in the pound be scuppered by \u201cheightened levels of political risk\u201d, she adds. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re getting a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy this morning, with results from supermarket chain Wm Morrison and retailer Majestic Wine. The early signs are encouraging, with Morrison\u2019s posting its best sales growth since 2009 - up 2.9% over the crucial Christmas period. That suggests UK consumer confidence is holding up, although Morrison\u2019s new management team should take the credit too. Majestic says its retail outlets had their biggest ever Christmas too, with like-for-like sales up 7.5%. So, Britain hasn\u2019t lost its appetite for wine - and after 2016, who can blame us? More on all that shortly.... Also coming up today Three City chiefs will be grilled by MPs about Brexit this morning. Douglas Flint of HSBC, Elizabeth Corley of Allianz Global Investors and Xavier Rolet of the London Stock Exchange are due before the Treasury committee at 10am. And City traders will be watching to see Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 can maintain its run of record highs.",

We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u2019s conference will be rising inequality, which the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\"> WEF has warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\">is the biggest problem facing the world. </a>The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, had led the west to \u201ca tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d.</p> <p>The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u201cCombating rising insecurity and inequality\u201d, to be introduced by the WEF\u2019s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u201cvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u201d. </p> <p>The extra Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re staff include \u201cspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u201d, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. </p> <p>The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u2019s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u201cThere are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u201cWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIce sculptures are always part of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/ilo-warns-of-rise-in-social-unrest-and-migration-as-inequality-widens\">ILO warns of rise in social unrest and migration as inequality widens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. </p> <p>\u201cI assume [the staff] get good tips,\u201d Kleber said, but \u201cmost of them are not coming for the money \u2013 they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u2026 Of course it\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u2019s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th US president.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2016/01/22/jack_ma_davos_party.php\">Cameron was photographed partying</a> tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events.</p> <p>Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. </p> <p>To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/strategic-partners\">Strategic Partners</a> of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. </p> <p>Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Annual_Report_2015-2016.pdf\">its annual report</a>. </p> <p>The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u2019s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u2019s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/economics-blog/2017/jan/11/are-americans-more-ready-to-accept-inequality-donald-trump\">Are Americans more ready to accept inequality?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u2019s parties as \u201cendless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u201d. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u2019s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u2019s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World.</p> <p>Many of this year\u2019s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/china-xi-jinping-world-economic-forum-davos-donald-trump\">China\u2019s two richest men</a>, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00fcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them.</p> <p>Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. </p> <p>The increase in private jet flights \u2013 which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u2013 comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2017\">annual global risks report</a> the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before.</p> <p>Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00a37,860. \u201cClients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos.

The court decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support.</p> <p><strong>Theresa May</strong></p> <p>The UK prime minister will be at Davos for the first time this year. May is not listed to appear on any panels, and the No 10 press office declined to provide any details of May\u2019s itinerary. David Cameron used his speech at Davos last year to reassure global business leaders that Britain would stay in the European Union. Cameron said he wanted to \u201cconfront this issue, I want to deal with it\u201d. \u201cMy aim is absolutely clear: I want to secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Shakira</strong></p> <p>The Grammy award-winning Colombian singer-songwriter will be at Davos in her role as a global ambassador for Unicef. She follows in the footsteps of other celebrities, including Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am, who have spoken at Davos to promote their charitable interests. Shakira will be promoting her Pies Descalzos / Barefoot Foundation, which helps provide education to poor and vulnerable children.</p> <p><strong>Matt Damon</strong></p> <p>The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting actor will be at Davos to talk about his continuing efforts to provide clean water to developing countries. Damon, who founded charity <a href=\"http://water.org/\">Water.org</a>, will speak at a session hosted by CNBC. In 2014, Damon told Davos that having travelled in developing countries he \u201cstarted to get a real appreciation for the magnitude of the water crisis\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Xi Jinping</strong></p> <p>The Chinese president will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to Davos. He is the first Chinese president to attend the WEF, and his visit is a statement of intent that China wants to assume a global leadership role as other world powers struggle with domestic tumult.</p> <p><strong>Joe Biden</strong></p> <p>The outgoing US vice-president will be at Davos, which runs until Friday \u2013 the same day as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.

                "bodyText":"Hundreds of chambermaids, doormen and cocktail waiters have been flown to Davos to cater to every whim of world leaders, business executives and the super-rich who will descend next week on the Swiss Alps town for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) celebration of capitalism. While WEF guests, including Theresa May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and South African president Jacob Zuma, will spend their nights in some of the world\u2019s most luxurious hotel suites, the staff brought in to serve them will be sleeping up to five to a room in bunk beds. The manager of the fanciest hotel in Davos \u2013 the Grandhotel Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re \u2013 said he had flown in 200 extra staff to work in shifts around the clock during the annual jamboree of the rich and powerful. \u201cWe normally have about 100 employees, but this week we have 300 to help us out,\u201d Thomas Kleber, general manager of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, said. Kleber said the extra staff have been flown in from partner hotels across the world to help out during the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re\u2019s busiest week of the year, but because the whole of Davos is packed out with forum visitors there isn\u2019t much space to accommodate the additional workers. \u201cWe have a staff house, but at this time of the year it is getting cosy,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe do have some different places with four or five people in one room. We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u201d Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u2019s conference will be rising inequality, which the WEF has warned is the biggest problem facing the world. The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, had led the west to \u201ca tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d. The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u201cCombating rising insecurity and inequality\u201d, to be introduced by the WEF\u2019s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u201cvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u201d. The extra Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re staff include \u201cspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u201d, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u2019s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver. Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u201cThere are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u201d he said. The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u201cWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIce sculptures are always part of it.\u201d Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. \u201cI assume [the staff] get good tips,\u201d Kleber said, but \u201cmost of them are not coming for the money \u2013 they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u2026 Of course it\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he added. Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u2019s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th US president. Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, Cameron was photographed partying tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events. Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become Strategic Partners of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to its annual report. The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u2019s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u2019s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u2019s parties as \u201cendless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u201d. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u2019s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u2019s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World. Many of this year\u2019s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, China\u2019s two richest men, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00fcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them. Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. The increase in private jet flights \u2013 which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u2013 comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its annual global risks report the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before. Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00a37,860. \u201cClients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos. The parties there have become a place to be. Davos is now on \u2018the circuit\u2019 along with the Superbowl, the Champions League final and the Monaco Grand Prix.\u201d The rich and powerful at Davos Christine Lagarde The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a firm fixture at the WEF, and will participate in at least three panels at this year\u2019s conference including \u201cSqueezed and Angry: How to fix the middle-class crisis\u201d, and another on how to \u201cchallenge stereotypes and institutional inertia to achieve gender parity within our lifetimes\u201d, as well as being keynote speaker on the wider challenges facing the economy this year. Lagarde, formerly a French minister, was recently found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u2019 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence. The court decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support. Theresa May The UK prime minister will be at Davos for the first time this year. May is not listed to appear on any panels, and the No 10 press office declined to provide any details of May\u2019s itinerary. David Cameron used his speech at Davos last year to reassure global business leaders that Britain would stay in the European Union. Cameron said he wanted to \u201cconfront this issue, I want to deal with it\u201d. \u201cMy aim is absolutely clear: I want to secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union,\u201d he said. Shakira The Grammy award-winning Colombian singer-songwriter will be at Davos in her role as a global ambassador for Unicef. She follows in the footsteps of other celebrities, including Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am, who have spoken at Davos to promote their charitable interests. Shakira will be promoting her Pies Descalzos / Barefoot Foundation, which helps provide education to poor and vulnerable children. Matt Damon The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting actor will be at Davos to talk about his continuing efforts to provide clean water to developing countries. Damon, who founded charity Water.org, will speak at a session hosted by CNBC. In 2014, Damon told Davos that having travelled in developing countries he \u201cstarted to get a real appreciation for the magnitude of the water crisis\u201d. Xi Jinping The Chinese president will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to Davos. He is the first Chinese president to attend the WEF, and his visit is a statement of intent that China wants to assume a global leadership role as other world powers struggle with domestic tumult. Joe Biden The outgoing US vice-president will be at Davos, which runs until Friday \u2013 the same day as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Biden, who will travel to Switzerland on Air Force 2, will \u201cdeliver remarks on the cancer moonshot and deliver an address on foreign policy\u201d, the White House said. Sheryl Sandberg The chief operating officer of Facebook, who has amassed a $1.3bn fortune from the social network according to Forbes, will speak at a panel about how older world leaders can harness the optimism of youth. The panel also includes: Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard; Last King of Scotland actor Forest Whitaker, and Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia. Sir Martin Sorrell Britain\u2019s best-paid boss \u2013 who collected \u00a370.5m from his advertising company WPP last year \u2013 will speak at a panel entitled \u201cSize Matters: The Future of Big Business\u201d. They will discuss how \u201cfewer than 10% of the world\u2019s public companies account for 80% of all profits. What does operating at this scale mean for competition, collaboration and innovation?\u201d Eric Schmidt The chairman of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is a regular at Davos, although he is not lined up to speak at any panels this year. Schmidt, 61, is the world\u2019s 36th richest man with a $11bn fortune, according to Forbes. Jack Ma The founder of Chinese internet group Alibaba is China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Last year he hosted a lavish party attended by David Cameron, Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey. Jamie Oliver The British celebrity chef-turned businessman will be interviewed by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington about \u201cdriving a healthy and sustainable food revolution\u201d. Oliver, who is worth $400m according to the Sunday Times rich list, was recently forced to close six of his Italian restaurants after tough trading and the \u201cpressures and unknowns\u201d following the Brexit vote. Khalid al-Falih Saudia Arabia\u2019s energy minister will be in demand as a key voice on Opec after the oil-producing countries recently agreed to cut output sending oil prices soaring. Al-Falih, who is also chairman of state oil and gas giant Saudi Aramco, has been put in charge of leading Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 \u2013 the country\u2019s plan to diversify away from oil dependency.",

Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hmmmm, maybe George. </p> <p>And on Europe, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOne has to recognize that the European Union has become too complicated and people are alienated.

After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019.</p> <p>This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter...</p> <p>In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning.</p> <p>Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44</li> <li>Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89</li> <li>France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14</li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%.</p> <p>As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:17:23.303Z\">at 5.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f2c0e4b01065cf59861d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:15:30.626Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV.</p> <p><em>On bank jobs leaving London:</em></p> <p>Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that.</p> <p><em>On the customs union:</em></p> <p>Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK.</p> <p><em>On globalisation:</em></p> <p> I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone.</p> <p><em>On the pound\u2019s weakness:</em></p> <p>Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p><em>And on technology and jobs:</em></p> <p>Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. <br></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-19/may-tells-banks-she-values-them-as-they-pack-their-brexit-bags\">Bloomberg\u2019s write-up</a> of the interview.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:20:15.585Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f01ee4b00b8fc2ae2666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:59:15.534Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes people feel globalization has &quot;left them behind,&quot; Theresa May says <a href=\"https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN\">https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5NaC9Y37cx\">pic.twitter.com/5NaC9Y37cx</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880ece5e4b0f0efb00f5cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nickfletcher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:54:45.388Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve had &quot;positive discussions&quot; with big banks about jobs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal\">@bbckamal</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/davos2017?src=hash\">#davos2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd\">https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FUjE1fEKMs\">pic.twitter.com/FUjE1fEKMs</a></p>&mdash; BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p>Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy.</p> <p>She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/822122563610480642\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of what UK PM May said in that BTV interview has already been discounted...

Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong.

For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy.<br></p> <p>The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day.</p> <p>Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u20ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u2019s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880a0f0e4b00b8fc2ae2452\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T11:38:13.002Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sadiq Khan: May must listen to businesses</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b629a09cab7c6a3175c3764900c686559489d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b629a09cab7c6a3175c3764900c686559489d42/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May leaves the stage after giving her speech today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May leaves the stage after giving her speech today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Gillieron/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Theresa May is in Davos today.</strong></p> <p>But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City.</p> <p>On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the fact she\u2019s got a plan is welcome.

                "bodyText":"Here are some of the key quotes from George Soros, for those who missed his interview here in Davos tonight (delegates are now polishing off the pudding and wine in the Seehof Hotel) In my opinion is is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament.And I think she will not last. At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted, and they live in hope.But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they\u2019ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won\u2019t rise as fast as the cost of living. The divorce is going to take a very long time. Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning. Hmmmm, maybe George. And on Europe, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday said: \u201cOne has to recognize that the European Union has become too complicated and people are alienated. The anti-European parties are gathering force.\u201d And that\u2019s all from Davos. Goodnight!! GW Soros also took a swipe at Hungary\u2019s government, which is threatening to crack down on the non-government agencies he funds. He reads out a statement, saying that these threats against civil society are an affront to European values. Before anyone mistakes George Soros for Cassandra, lets remember that he predicted a year ago that Europe would disintegrate. He now says it won\u2019t - because neither Vladimir Putin nor China want it to fail. This session is being streamed live on Bloomberg TV, for anyone who hasn\u2019t made it to the Seehof hotel in Davos. Soros is taking questions from the room now -- and accepting them by email too, at sorosdavos2017@gmail.com Onto China....and Soros says Beijing would have no choice but to retaliate if Donald Trump labelled it a currency manipulator. It\u2019s much harder to get divorced than to get married, Soros continues, explaining why the Brexit process will take a long time. And he even suggests that Britain could quit the EU on a Friday, and rejoin on the Monday (!) George Soros now declares that it is unlikely that prime minister Theresa May will remain in power for long. She has already got a divided cabinet and a small majority in parliament....I think she will not last, Soros tells his audience of Davos delegates. The people in the UK are in denial, Soros continues. The current economic situation is not as bad as expected, so they live in hope, but as the currency depreciates, inflation will lead to a decline in living standards. It will take time, but when it happens they will realise they are not as well off as before, Soros concludes. If Europe breaks down, the consequences will be very dire, Soros concludes. And currently it is going in the wrong direction. Q: How will Brexit play out? I hope that both sides realise they must find some common ground. A bitter divorce would hurt both sides - And the divorce will be a long process. But when people realise they are going in the wrong direction, they will come together. Soros cites the Guardian\u2019s recent story that Michel Barnier was pushing for a special deal for the City. Last year was a disaster for Europe, Soros continues, with the Brexit vote and the Italian election. Europe has become too complicated, and people are alienated - the anti-European parties are gathering force and the future looks very bleak Hello again from the Seehof hotel in Davos, where veteran billionaire investor/philantropist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. On Donald Trump, Soros says he has described Trump as an imposter, a conman and a would-be dictator. But he is confident that the constitution of the US and division of power will hold sway. He would be a dictator if he could get away with it..but he won\u2019t. When Trump oversteps the mark, they will fight back, Soros predicts. He believes that Trump was surprised to win the November election.....he was engaged in building his brand and his success in attracting crowds. Soros says he\u2019s convinced that Trump will fail - not because people want him to, but because the ideas that drive him are essentially contradictory. For example, he has three chiefs of staff instead of one, and there will be tensions within his cabinet - meaning a lot of infighting in future. And that means that the markets won\u2019t maintain recent gains, Soros predicts: Right now, uncertainty is at its peak, and uncertainty is the enemy of long-term investment. It\u2019s all winding down in the WEF conference centre now; but we\u2019ll hoping to cover an interview/dinner with George Soros at around 8.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT) Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish comments at the latest European Central Bank meeting sent the euro lower and also helped push European markets marginally into the red. And with the dollar also weaker against the pound, the FTSE 100 also fell back - unsurprising given much of its recent gains have been due to the weakness of sterling boosting overseas earners. After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019. This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter... In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning. Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%. As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590. Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV. On bank jobs leaving London: Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that. On the customs union: Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK. On globalisation: I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone. On the pound\u2019s weakness: Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom. And on technology and jobs: Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. And here is Bloomberg\u2019s write-up of the interview. Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace. Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future. This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy. She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reckons that European leaders won\u2019t be scared by Philip Hammond\u2019s threat to slash taxes and regulation if Britain doesn\u2019t get a good Brexit deal. May and Hammond had two aims in Davos. The first was to convince UK business leaders they had a plan, an objective largely achieved even among those that think tough times lie ahead. The second was to smooth things over with businesses and politicians in the rest of Europe, which has been far less successful. May and Hammond seem oblivious to the current level of hostility towards the UK. Nor is the May-Hammond \u201ciron fist in the velvet glove\u201d routine likely to make the rest of Europe soften its hard line in the negotiations. Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong. The EU 27 will see scorched earth as an empty threat. Which it is. Here\u2019s his full analysis: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the new head of the United Nations, has singled out youth unemployment as a major threat to global security. In a keynote speech, Guterres says that: The scourge of youth unemployment is probably the worst problem we are facing today, with consequences for the wellbeing of the people involved, societies, and global security too. Young unemployment people in several parts of the world are the largest area of recruitment for terrorist groups. Guterres also warns that we live in a \u201cdangerous world\u201d today; countries must bolster their efforts to deliver peace. The euro has weakened on Mario Draghi\u2019s comments at the ECB\u2019s first press conference of 2017, with investors interpreting his stance as largely dovish. After announcing its decision to leave key interest rates and the quantitative easing (QE) programme unchanged at its 1,000th board meeting, the ECB president highlighted downside risks to the eurozone economy from \u201cglobal uncertainty\u201d and noted a lack of underlying upward pressure on inflation. Much of the recent rise in inflation, he says, is down to energy price movements and he also pointed out nominal wages growth remains subdued. There is more of that in his opening statement. Draghi appeared keen to send the message that the ECB remains ready to do more to shore up the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery as necessary. Draghi said there was no discussion of tapering - the process of winding down QE. In the wake of criticism from German politicians over how low interest rates were hurting those with savings, he also called on people to be patient with the ECB. He patiently fielded several questions on German low rate angst. To the likely disappointment of reporters at the news conference, the ECB president dodged a question on whether Donald Trump could make life more difficult for those charged with safeguarding the euro after the president elect said in an interview that it would be a struggle keeping the euro together. A careful Draghi said: I just won\u2019t make any comment on that... I would rather comment on policies and policy actions than just statements.\u201d His apparently relaxed stance on inflation left the euro down 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.0600 by the end of the news conference. Against the pound it is down 0.6% on the day to 86.19 pence. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 share index turned positive after the apparent promise of ultra-low interest rates for a very long time to come. Commenting on the tone of the press conference, David Lamb sums up the likely reaction of German politicians: In Berlin, Mario Draghi\u2019s unwavering dovishness will go down about as well as Donald Trump\u2019s hints of tariffs on German cars... With the money-printing set to continue until further notice, inflationary pressures will return and the euro has taken an immediate hit. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima says the\u201drace to the bottom on corporate tax\u201d needs to be addressed. It\u2019s worrying now. We\u2019ve seen the promise from president-elect Trump to cut corporate tax. We\u2019ve heard Theresa May threatening to make Britain a little island with low tax rates on the shores of Europe. These are steps in the wrong direction. This year we need to see progress on this corporate tax competition. This isn\u2019t just an issue of legal compliance, Byanyima continues. The local corner shop where I buy bread probably pays a higher tax rate than Apple. We want to see big companies take this as more than a legal compliance, and see it as a moral issue to society - to provide their fair share to fund heath, education, to create jobs for young people, she adds. Switzerland is now \u2018fighting the good fight\u2019 against tax avoidance today, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. Some background: the new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) come into effect in September 2017, when around 50 jurisdictions will work towards having their first information exchanges. Angel Gurria insists that real progress has been made in fighting tax avoidance and evasion. Back in 2008, there were 30 agreements to share tax information. Today there are 3,500, he says. The promise is enormous, and the potential is very great and it could really help these developing countries. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima is adamant that the current plans don\u2019t go far enough. Simply hiring more tax collectors doesn\u2019t address the use of tax loopholes, or the wider issue of low corporate tax rates. The transparency is good, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough. It doesn\u2019t have public country-by-country recording -- if people don\u2019t know what firms are doing, you\u2019re not going to get the secrecy out and tax them fairly. Panama\u2019s vice-president points the finger at big companies for forcing tax breaks out of developing countries. Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado says some multinationals go to 3rd World companies and \u201cinsist on negotiating tax breaks that local companies don\u2019t have\u201d, in return for siting their operations there. Poland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, reckons the global tax avoidance problem is probably even bigger than that $240bn figure. Morawiecki says that the three countries who make the most foreign direct investment into the European Union are the United States, then Switzerland, then Bermuda. And the list of FDI payments to countries from the EU is exactly the same (ie, the most goes to the US, then Switzerland then Bermuda). If this is not huge, global tax evasion, I don\u2019t know what is. Tax avoidance is a human rights issue, declares Winnie Byanyima, executive director at Oxfam International. She tells her audience at WEF that Kenya is losing $1.1bn every year through tax incentives and tax exceptions. That\u2019s almost double its health budget; in a country where 1 in 40 children die at childbirth. This is really a human rights issue. Byanyima is much less optimist than the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria - she agrees there is progress, but we have a long way to go. She brings a home truth to Davos too: First of all, the developing countries are not at the table, while a notorious tax haven like Switzerland had a place at the table. There is a harmful race to the bottom with countries offering lower tax rates to attract companies (something Philip Hammond has been hinting at), Byanyima adds, saying pointedly: If you can\u2019t dodge taxes, you pay the government to lower the tax rate. Companies need to be forced to provide proper country-by-country reporting of their tax bills, she concludes, to get proper transparency: Yes we are moving, but not fast enough or broadly enough. Panama\u2019s vice-president says her government understands the importance of taxes, both to fund Panama\u2019s spending and to help other countries fight evasion. According to Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, Panama had been taking action since her government took office 2 and a half-years ago. Before the Panama Papers, President Varela had announced our commitment to automatic information sharing, to the United Nations. And then this leak came, which pointed out a global problem... A global problem which Panama needs to participate in the solution, and the rest of the world needs to participate in the solution. It made us run faster, we were already running. I can say today there is not one issue pending in Panama\u2019s steps to comply with international standards on information sharing, she adds. The panel begins by hearing that countries lose $240bn of tax revenues per year through tax avoidance by companies, according to the OECD 100 countries have signed to an information-sharing deal. Is it making a difference? Absolutely, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. And that includes Panama, which has signed up too. My message to the Panamanian Congress is - yes, pass the law. Complying with the tax system doesn\u2019t mean changing it, it means enforcing it, Gurria continues. And next September, countries will start automatic information sharing - companies who haven\u2019t reported information correctly will be caught out. Nine months ago the Guardian exposed how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca was helping some of the world\u2019s richest people, and its largest companies, avoid tax. Those revelations helped to drive the issue of aggressive tax avoidance high up the political agenda. Now, a heavyweight group at Davos are discussing how to get multinational companies to pay a fair share -- an issue Theresa May also highlighted in her speech. On the panel: Angel Gurr\u00eda: Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Winnie Byanyima: Executive Director, Oxfam International Valdis Dombrovskis: Vice-President and Commissioner, Euro and Socia..., European Commission Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado: Vice-President of Panama Mateusz Morawiecki: Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Here\u2019s some background reading while we wait for it to start: Chancellor Philip Hammond turned a bit lyrical when he spoke to business leaders today, telling them that the \u201cfog of Brexit\u201d was starting to lift. \u201cWe are not going to get rid of it overnight but I hope gradually it will start to lift. A few things are becoming clearer through the mist.\u201d The chancellor also stressed that the Government would do whatever necessary to ensure Britain remained competitive in the event that the rest of the EU cuts up rough in the divorce negotiations for Brexit. Hammond said: If somehow despite out best efforts political retribution were to triumph over economic logic, and we don\u2019t get a fair deal....we will have to do whatever was necessary to ensure the continued competitiveness in those circumstances. \u201cThat\u2019s not a threat. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious.\u201d He returned to the theme in the Q&amp;A session after his speech, saying that a free trade deal with the EU was not the only way for Britain to remain competitive. \u201cWe have reinvented ourselves before and we will do so again if we have to.\u201d Elsewhere in Davos, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has taken another stride onto the world stage by announcing a major sponsorship deal with the Olympics. Ma\u2019s Alibaba has signed up until 2028, and will provide cloud computing services, and help build a new e-commerce platform to flog Olympic branded products to the masses. They\u2019ll also help develop and customise the Olympic Channel, a web site, for a Chinese audience. No pricing details, I\u2019m afraid. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been praising the City, at a lunch with top UK CEOs and journalists. Hammond warns that \u2018fragmenting the City\u2019 isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interests, but he has also repeated his warning that the UK could lower taxes and regulations if it can\u2019t get a good Brexit deal: Hammond also touches on the customs union issue that is worrying Sir Angus Deaton: Away from Davos, the European Central Bank has confirmed it is leaving its key interest rates unchanged and not tinkering any more for now with its bond-buying programme, AKA quantitative easing (QE). Amid signs that inflation and growth are picking up, the Frankfurt-based central bank for the eurozone also stuck to its previous guidance that it stood ready to act should things take a turn for the worse. The full statement is here, but here\u2019s a flavour: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases... If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the [asset purchase] programme in terms of size and/or duration.\u201d We will get a clearer sense of how ECB policymakers see things when president Mario Draghi hosts a news conference at 13.30GMT. The ECB surprised markets in December by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u20ac60bn (\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u20ac80bn currently. But whatever you do, don\u2019t try and tell Mario Draghi that\u2019s tapering. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who isn\u2019t at Davos, alas) has responded to May\u2019s speech: \u201cToday in Davos the Prime Minister talked about making globalisation work for all. But actions speak louder than words. \u201cAt every opportunity, the Conservatives have given handouts to the wealthiest and cut taxes for big business - while refusing to provide vital funds for the NHS, cutting social care and ditching rights at work. \u201cTheresa May\u2019s vision for Brexit is now clear: a bargain basement Britain on the shores of Europe based on low pay and deregulation. \u201cThis week we heard the Prime Minister threaten to turn Britain into a tax haven, slashing corporate taxes and workers\u2019 rights in an all-out race to the bottom. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be taken in by warm words. This Conservative Government is backed to the hilt by wealthy elites, lines the pockets of its friends and resists all practical steps to make a fairer Britain work for all\u201d. Nobel prize winner Sir Angus Deaton tells me that May\u2019s speech missed out some key issues. For starters, there was no mention of Scotland - Deaton\u2019s home country. He wants to be a member of the European Union, and a member of the United Kingdom - and now that doesn\u2019t seem possible. And on trade, Deaton says: I was also surprised she talked about free trade all the time, and she didn\u2019t talk about the customs union. That\u2019s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain. So I haven\u2019t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out. This was the first time that Deaton has watched May speak in the flesh, and he was reminded of an earlier Conservative leader. The immediate analogy when you see her for the first time is, this looks like Mrs Thatcher. But when you listen to her, she\u2019s sort of the anti-Thatcher in some sense. Mrs Thatcher used to say there is no society, while she was talking about society. Mrs Thatcher would have not been very keen on taking us out of the EU. So it really is very different from Mrs Thatcher. Theresa May\u2019s stern rebuke to businesses who are not paying a fair share of tax sounded good in the cavernous WEF hall. However, we should remember that Britain has been lowering its own corporation tax rate for years to attract firms to base here. And just last week, chancellor Philip Hammond threatened that the UK might abandon European-style regulations and taxes after Brexit, if the economy struggles. The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Liberal Democrat party, Tim Farron, says: \u201cThe Prime Minister certainly has a brass neck. She goes to Davos to lecture businesses about looking after the little guy yet she threatens to turn the UK into a Europe\u2019s biggest tax haven. \u201cThis shows, yet again, that this Tory government are treating our country like UK plc. They are running our economy like it is a closing down sale. But higher prices and more expensive fuel mean families will feel the brunt of this government\u2019s bad economic policies.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s speech may have been a hot ticket at Davos and generally well received by those present, but the market reaction back home was far more muted than the wild gyrations seen during Tuesday\u2019s Brexit performance. For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy. The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day. Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u20ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u2019s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail. London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Theresa May is in Davos today. But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City. On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe. I think the fact she\u2019s got a plan is welcome. I think the fact she\u2019s here is brilliant But I think she needs to be listening to what our friends, chief executives, innovators, entrepreneurs, political leaders are saying, which is that no-one is bringing us bad will. There\u2019s no bad feeling here. But there\u2019s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no-one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe. Businesses that leave London aren\u2019t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Frankfurt, they\u2019re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Khan says he fully accepts the referendum result, but argues that \u201cno-one voted to make us poorer\u201d. So the government must make it a priority to get \u201cprivileged access to the single market\u201d so London can still attract talent. The good news is that over the last six months Google, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat have expanded their presence in London. But the bad news is that, as a consequence of the speech on Tuesday we have some banks and investment firms expressing unease about their future. Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has also given May a thumbs-up for her comments on making globalisation work. Speaking to AFP newswires here, she said: It was a good speech. She captured lots of the concerns about a responsible globalisation that we all talk about. Katherine Garrett-Cox, the former chief executive of Alliance Trust, tells me that Theresa May gave Davos what it wanted. I think she did a very good job of setting out a clear plan in terms of what Britain intends to do, what Britain intends to stand for, and I think that\u2019s really what people wanted to hear. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of criticism over the past six months over where does this start and where does it go. I think we heard very clearly that that\u2019s the plan, and now we\u2019ve got to get on and do it. Q: Can we do it, though, at the same time as negotiating Brexit? We\u2019ve all heard that the divorce, as people have called it, is going to be complicated and complex. But I think we all have to believe that we can do it, so I\u2019m optimistic. Q: What\u2019s your biggest concern now with Brexit? My biggest concern is that businesses step up and embrace the opportunity rather than constantly looking for the downside. I\u2019ve grabbed a word with Dr Paul Sheard, the chief global economist of Standard &amp; Poors, outside the conference room. He says May gave a \u201cvery good\u201d speech. Theresa May was laying down a stake and saying - Britain will be the lead supporting voice for globalisation in the world. A lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She\u2019s pivoting to saying \u2018no, this is about Britain being very global\u2019. We now have two global leaders, President Xi Jinping and Theresa May, both making a pitch in support of globalisation, Sheard adds. Two days ago, Chinese president Xi Jinping wowed Davos with a speech defending globalisation, at a time when Donald Trump has put free trade under threat. And now Theresa May has declared that Britain is determined to become a more powerful player after Brexit, despite the difficult negotiations ahead. 1) She seemed to give Davos what it wanted to hear, saying that the UK will be a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d after leaving the EU I want the UK to emerge from this period of change as a truly Global Britain \u2013 the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too; a country that gets out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. 2) She threw her weight behind the growing pressure to fix globalisation to address the populist surge in politics; a major issue this year. May, though, took an almost moral tone, speaking about how the responsibilities we have to one another have been forgotten. This was the key line: But just as we need to act to address the deeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years, so we also need to recognise the way in which a more global and individualistic world can sometimes loosen the ties that bind our society together, leaving some people feeling locked out and left behind. 3) She was interventionist, highlighting her industrial strategy and saying: For government, it means not just stepping back and \u2013 as the prevailing orthodoxy in many countries has argued for so many years \u2013 not just getting out of the way. Not just leaving businesses to get on with the job and assuming that problems will just fix themselves. It means stepping up to a new, active role that backs businesses and ensures more people in all corners of the country share in the benefits of its success. 4) And she criticised business leaders too, especially those multinationals who can seem to play by different rules. Theresa May ended her speech with a call on global leaders and business chiefs to work together to make globalisation work for everyone. As we build a new, bold, confident Global Britain and shape a new era of globalisation that genuinely works for all As we harness the forces of globalisation so that the system works for everyone, and so maintain public support for that system for generations to come. I want that to be the legacy of our time. To use this moment to provide responsive, responsible leadership that will bring the benefits of free trade to every corner of the world; that will lift millions more out of poverty and towards prosperity; and that will deliver security, prosperity and belonging for all of our people. May returns to the downsides of globalisation - and the damage it has done to societies. Too often today, the obligations we have to each other have been forgotten, she says. We need to recognise how a more global and individualistic world can loosen the ties that bind us together. And May stakes her flag firmly, declaring: I am determined that centre-ground mainstream politics can respond to the concerns people have today. That means standing up for free trade and globalisation, but also ensuring it works for everyone. And she quotes Edmund Burke, who wrote: A state without the means for some change is without the means for its own conservation. May insists that governments have an obligation to help those who need help the most. If you\u2019re just getting by, you don\u2019t want a government that gets out of the way - you want one that will help you. Government and business need to do even more to make the case for globalisation, May continues. She cites her new industrial strategy -- a term that had fallen into disrepute in recent years. But Britain is going to create the conditions where winners can grow and thrive, not about \u2018picking winners\u2019. We must step up and take control to make sure that free trade and globalisation works for everyone. May now addresses the UK business leaders in the audience - saying they must do more to help the public. She cites the importance of everyone paying a fair share of tax. In the UK, trust with business runs at just 35% among the lowest-income groups. Companies must putting aside short-term considerations, and investing in people and communities for the long term. There is a feeling that some companies, especially multinationals, are playing by a different set of rules to everyone else, May declares. It is essential for business to show leadership - to show that in this globalised world, everyone is playing by the same rules. On globalisation, May reiterates that some people are being left behind by economic changes - they are getting by but not getting on. On slavery, May urges her audience to help tackle this abhorent problem; she has convened a top-level panel at Davos today to seek solutions. May reminds the audience of the dark days in the first half of the 20th century. We must uphold the institutions that help the world to work together, and guarantee global security. May also cites Britain\u2019s multicultural heritage. May is outlining her vision of making Britain a truly global country. We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again. A country in charge of its own destiny is in a better position to take the lead in improving the world, she continues. She cites the fact that some of Britain\u2019s most famous car brands, like Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by India\u2019s Tata. Brexit was a vote to take control, and make decisions ourselves, May continues. Britain\u2019s history and culture is profoundly international, she says. We have always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We are, by instinct, a great global trading nation. And we want to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world. She welcomes the fact that preliminary talks are underway with several countries including Australia, while China and the Gulf States have expressed interest in making deals with us. Britain faces a time of momentous change, and tough negotiations, May says, following the Brexit vote. But we must believe that it will lead to a better future British people chose to build a truly global country, May says. And we face the future with confidence. May\u2019s on the stage now. This is an organisation that is committed to improving the state of the world. Those of us who meet here are optimists, who believe in the power of public and private collaboration to make the world tomorrow better than today. Free trade, partnership and globalisation. But outside this hall, those forces for good which we take for granted are being called into question. Forces that have had such a positive impact, lifting millions out of poverty, broken down barriers and raised living standards, are now being undermined. As we meet here, across Europe parties of the far left and far right are trying to profit from a keenly felt sense, especially among those on modest incomes, that these forces are not working for them. These people feel that mainstream political and business leaders have failed to appreciate their legitimate concerns for too long, May says. But she will lay out an agenda for how mainstream politics can address this. Davos\u2019s founder Klaus Schwab has taken the stage, to introduce Theresa May. Schwab says he was born before world war 2 broke out - for him, Europe was a big dream of never having war again, and feeling united. He says he\u2019s very pleased to hear Theresa May say that the UK will not leave Europe, but will have a very amicable divorce. Hammond and Khan are now chatting together, as we wait for the PM... Chancellor Philip Hammond just marched into the hall, not far behind Sadiq Khan. Even the global elite have to queue sometimes. There\u2019s a massive line snaking around the conference now, as delegates try to bag a decent seat to watch Theresa May in 25 minutes. There\u2019s a flurry of activity as some of the global elite head into a private meeting in the heart of the WEF conference centre. It looks like an IGWEL - or Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders in the Davos jargon. I\u2019ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and HSBC chairman Douglas Flint arriving (you can see Lagarde here) One insider says they\u2019ll be discussing sustainable development; hopefully they\u2019ll still catch Theresa May\u2019s speech too. London mayor Sadiq Khan is also in Davos today. He\u2019s been meeting with business leaders, and arguing for Britain to get privileged access to the single market. He\u2019s just giving an interview to the BBC now, saying that his message to EU leaders is not to assume the Brexit vote was a one-off. Unless you address the concerns around globalisation, unless you address these issues, if there\u2019s a vote in your country whether to stay or leave the EU don\u2019t be surprised if your voters decide to leave the EU. Good morning from Davos, and day three of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. Theresa May swept into the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re hotel in the centre of this ski resort last night, on the latest stage in her push for Brexit. The UK PM is the hottest act in town today; at 10.15am local time (9.15am GMT) she will deliver a special address to an audience of fellow world leaders, business chiefs and economists. The speech gets top billing: Britain after Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will spell out the economic implications of leaving the European Union May is expected to talk about those who have not prospered under globalisation; linking the Brexit vote into a broader theme that has dominated talk at Davos this week already. One Downing Street source told Sky News overnight that: \u201cThe PM is reflecting themes she\u2019s spoken about before - that change has to come in order to benefit who have been left behind.\u201d May\u2019s likely to use the speech to pitch for more global trade, saying Britain remains open to business despite voting to leave the EU. The speech could also include a hard-hitting section on modern slavery; a priority for May since her days as Britain\u2019s Home Secretary. May is also meeting bank chiefs in Davos, such as Wall Street bosses who are wondering whether to start moving jobs and operations out of the City in anticipation of the UK leaving the single market. Bloomberg: May Meets Wall Streeters in Davos as Banks Plan Brexit Exodus It could be a tricky Davos debut for May; the Guardian reports this morning that European leaders are presenting a united front ahead of the EU exit talks. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, led the way, predicted that negotiating Brexit will be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d But May has allies here too; chancellor Philip Hammond will meet with a clutch of UK business chiefs at a lunch later. We\u2019ve also spied Liam Fox; the Secretary of international trade told us last night that he\u2019s here to make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action from Davos through the day...",
