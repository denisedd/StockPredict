But one at least performed well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/poundland-shareholders-approve-takeover-by-steinhoff\">with Poundland being sold to South Africa\u2019s Steinhoff</a> at a premium to our starting price. And the advertising giant WPP was the star performer, up 16%.</p> <p>Undaunted, here are our predictions for what is likely to be another tricky year, as Brexit rumbles on, Donald Trump takes over in the US and France and Germany face key elections:</p> <h2>Flybe</h2> <p>A dose of reality has returned to airline prices lately after the likes of the BA owner IAG and easyJet once soared. One airline afflicted with too much reality since its laughably high initial valuation is Flybe. A \u201cturnaround plan\u201d looked more like a 360 backwards loop. But fans of a dead cat bounce might like to gamble on an airline with shares at just 44p. Under new management, it could revive slightly if air passenger duty is cut, and may get more subsidised domestic routes if it can stay in business. <strong>Gwyn Topham</strong><br></p> <h2>Diageo</h2> <p>The share price of the Smirnoff, Baileys and Johnnie Walker drinks company <strong>Diageo </strong>is already up on a upward trajectory as a result of the 23 June referendum. Sterling\u2019s 17% slump against the dollar flatters its earning power as just 10% of its revenue is generated in the UK. The US is around half the market for the company. Hence the rally since the vote to leave the EU. It might still be one to watch in 2017 at \u00a321.10; some analysts have pointed out that alcohol sales might be resilient in these uncertain times and as of June, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/women-in-uk-boardrooms-still-low-equalities-nicky-morgan-female-ftse100-davies\">Female FTSE board report produced by Cranfield</a>, it has the highest gender balance of any major stock market listed company. <strong>Jill Treanor</strong></p> <h2>Tesco</h2> <p>Tipping a supermarket when economists are predicting the UK is heading for economic slowdown and a significant rise in inflation, in a market where price competition is tough, might seem foolhardy. But Tesco is in recovery mode. More than two years after it was battered by an accounting scandal and five years after it started losing customers rapidly to lower priced discounters like Aldi and Lidl, there are signs it is on the mend. Dave Lewis, the chief executive hired in from Unilever, has improved sales and customer service, and boosted shelf availability. The grocer appears to have what all businesses seek: forward momentum. Tesco sales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/uk-grocery-prices-tesco-kantar\">were up 1.6% in the 12 weeks to 4 December versus 2015</a>. Its market share has climbed from 28% to 28.3% in a year; this may sound small but in the \u00a3130bn grocery market that is a substantial gain, especially when it is opening very few new stores. Tesco shares performed well last year \u2013 rising from 142p to 207p \u2013 but they could have further to go. <strong>Julia Finch</strong></p> <h2>Randgold Resources</h2> <p>Chaos and uncertainty are usually good for gold and only an optimist would bet on smooth sailing for the global economy during 2017. The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Mali-focused gold miner Randgold Resources has been on a downward run since last summer although it picked up towards the end of 2016 as gold recovered. The company\u2019s prospects have recently been upgraded by investment banks including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley and the stock is looking pretty cheap at \u00a364.15 after its six-month losing streak. Its management team is stable and experienced, so they are unlikely to spring any unpleasant surprises. <strong>Rob Davies</strong></p> <h2>Ted Baker</h2> <p>The fashion retailer\u2019s shares, now \u00a328.14, are down 13% on the start of 2016 after taking a thrashing after the Brexit vote on fears of cost inflation and consumer confidence. It is likely to be subject to cost increases as a result of a fall in the value of the pound against the dollar in which it sources clothing abroad. But it has a natural hedge against that thanks to a growing overseas business, which will be now be boosted by the currency changes. Meanwhile British shoppers have so far proved resilient and the winter season is likely to have gone better for all clothing retailers as more normal weather conditions have prevailed after two years of unseasonable warmth. . The UK market will get tougher in 2017 but this is a well-run business with a growing international profile that is likely to help it continue to grow in a tough climate. <strong>Sarah Butler</strong></p> <h2>Associated British Foods</h2> <p>Shares in Associated British Foods have fallen from their 2016 peak, on concerns about a slowdown at its discount retailer Primark and the outlook for its sugar business. But a recent update reassured investors, with Primark\u2019s expansion continuing and sugar recovering as prices move higher and cost-cutting benefits start to take hold. There are concerns about the effects of the weak pound on Primark\u2019s products sourced from abroad but opening 1.3m square feet of new store space next year should still help to fuel growth, although margins are expected to come under pressure. Even so, the shares at \u00a327.45 could have further to rise. <strong>Nick Fletcher</strong></p> <h2>Dairy Crest</h2> <p>After selling its milk business at the end of 2015, <strong>Dairy Crest</strong> is free to focus on developing its specialist brands and expanding overseas. The company owns Cathedral City cheese, Clover margarine, and is selling demineralised whey into China for use in baby food. The milk business was barely profitable so Dairy Crest can now spend more on marketing and widening the range of products it sells. In 2017 it could also benefit from price inflation and the fall in the value of sterling helping the overseas business by making sales more valuable. The share price fell slightly in 2016 and looks decent value at 619.5p. <strong>Graham Ruddick</strong></p> <h2>ConvaTec Group</h2> <p>Analysts at UBS, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Cazenove and Deutsche Bank are all glowing about the prospects for the shares in medical supplies firm <strong>ConvaTec Group</strong> \u2013 but let\u2019s not hold that against the company. The City\u2019s professional scribblers may have almost as bad a track record when it comes to picking stockmarket winners as anybody else, but ConvaTec only floated in October at 225p, shot into the FTSE 100 in December and closed the year at 233.9p. So the firm is new enough to be receiving unconditional support from the Square Mile\u2019s cheerleaders for a bit yet. <strong>Simon Goodley</strong></p> <h2>Card Factory</h2> <p>With 2017 expected to be a tough year for retailers, the no frills greeting card firm <strong>Card Factory</strong> has some admirable qualities. The Yorkshire business operates squarely in the value end of the market, focusing on cards costing less than \u00a31. It is also vertically integrated, with greeting cards rolling off the presses at its printworks in Shipley. Demand for its products is fairly predictable as birthdays come round every year, and the internet has not wreaked as much havoc as in other retail sub-sectors. The share price was down nearly 30% in 2016 to 253p as weak high street footfall and the Brexit vote hit sentiment, but this is a cash-generative retailer which pays generous dividends. <strong>Zoe Wood</strong></p> <h2>Shire</h2> <p>After an acquisition spree, <strong>Shire</strong>, which is listed in London, based in Dublin and run from Boston, is one of the main pharma players globally focusing on treatments for rare diseases and specialised conditions such as haemophilia. Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/shire-clinches-32bn-takeover-of-baxalta\">the $32bn takeover of US firm Baxalta</a>, Shire chief executive Flemming \u00d8rnskov is targeting $20bn in annual revenues by 2020. Risks include pressure on drug pricing in the US, but Shire\u2019s new dry eye drop Xiidra has had a strong launch there and it has a good pipeline of new products. It is also a clear winner from the weak pound and compared with rivals its shares look cheap at \u00a346.84. <strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></p>",

In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound against other major currencies has boosted the UK\u2019s competitiveness on the international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export orders performing well.</p> <p>However, sterling\u2019s fall also means that imported components are more expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 2017 from 2.2% in 2016.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586b7e3fe4b0a43edaa20bd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-03T10:36:46.064Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland</strong>, <em>reports Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent.</em></p> <p>The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the \u2018British Irish Gateway to Trade\u2019 service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea.</p> <p>Britain remains Ireland\u2019s biggest trading partner with business between the UK and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.

The annual rate rose to 1.7% in December, the highest since July 2013, and compared with 0.7% the month before. The increase which comes alongside a pick-up in inflation in France and Spain provides ammunition for those at the European Central Bank who are arguing for a gradual exit from the bank\u2019s unconventional stimulus programme. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is up more than 150 points, or 0.8%, at 19,915.73 at the open, flirting with the 20,000 mark. The Nasdaq is more than 40 points ahead at 5,424.16 while the S&amp;P 500 is some 17 points higher at 2,255.81, both gains of nearly 0.8%. UK grocery prices rose slightly between November and December, but prices remained below 2015 due to competition among supermarkets, according to data from price tracking website mysupermarket.com. A shopping basket of 35 commonly bought items cost \u00a383.33 in December, up from \u00a383.18 in November. Fresh fruit and veg cost more such as bananas, grapes and carrots. But the basket was still nearly 3% cheaper than it was in December 2015, as fierce competition between supermarkets limited their ability to raise prices. Economists and retail experts expect food inflation to rise this year because the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote is pushing up the cost of imported goods. The tracker covers nearly 5,000 products across Tesco, Asda, Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s, Ocado, Lidl and Morrisons. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Importantly, the delay means that the Trump administration, which has in the past suggested it wants to relax banking regulation, will now be involved in signing off the new proposals. The proposals are already contentious, but whether they will be weakened remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the retail sector has an early dose of the January blues, he noted, with Next, Dixons Carphone and Marks &amp; Spencer the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today. Halfords is still the biggest loser in the FTSE 350 index. Those with substantial import costs have been hit particularly hard, after Deutsche Bank flagged the potential for lower sterling to lead to higher inflation in a research note released this morning. With the note highlighting the difficulties a weak pound could bring to Halfords\u2019 already increasing cost base, shares in the UK\u2019s leading retailer of motoring and cycling products fell by 5.6%. Our City editor Jill Treanor writes: Global regulators have postponed a meeting to agree major reforms to the banking sector prompted by the 2008 crisis. A leading group of central bankers was due to meet on 8 January to agree changes that could have forced some banks - largely in Europe - to hold more capital. But it was announced on Tuesday that the meeting had been called off. No new date was given for the meeting of central bankers - known as the group of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS) - who were due to discuss rules that influence how much capital banks hold and the way they measure the risks they are taking. Banks are the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, led by Barclays which is up 4%, after global regulators delayed the sign off of new rules on bank capitalisation. Lloyds Banking Group is 3.6% ahead while Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 3.3%, Standard Chartered 2.4% and HSBC is up 2%. Mining shares, which have been among the big winners of the weak pound in the past year, are also among the biggest gainers, including Antofagasta and Glencore. Oil prices have been rising as new production cuts take effect, as reported earlier. This is feeding through to petrol prices. UK drivers are paying 15p a litre \u2013 or \u00a38.25 a tank \u2013 more for their fuel than a year ago, according to the AA. Petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared to 102.69p at the same time last year, a price last seen in December 2014. Diesel has risen to 120.35p from 105.99p 12 months ago. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 2015. All in all, with the cold weather, it\u2019s been a pretty miserable return to work. UK workers\u2019 confidence has not been shaken by uncertainty around leaving the European Union, with 48% saying that they are looking for a new job this year, according to specialist recruiter Reed. It asked more than 2,000 people about their careers in 2017, and found that 43% are feeling optimistic about their career prospects. The FTSE 100 has hit fresh all-time highs on the first trading day of the year in London, building on its record close at the end of 2016. It rose through the 7,200 mark earlier to a new record of 7,205.21 and is now more than 30 points ahead at 7,176.20, a 0.5% gain. The leading index is on track for another record close if it holds on to its gains. Retailers are among the biggest fallers, led by Next, which was downgraded by Deutsche Bank ahead of a Christmas trading update tomorrow. Dixons Carphone, Marks &amp; Spencer and Kingfisher are also down. European bourses are also ahead. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.04% at 11,602.96 France\u2019s CAC up 0.5% at 4,906.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.4% at 9,460.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.7% at 19,703.28 Britain\u2019s factories are booming, according to the latest manufacturing PMI survey from Markit/CIPS. This drove the pound to a two-week high against the euro. Oil prices reached 18-month highs this morning as production cuts kick in. Brent crude touched $58.37 a barrel earlier and is now up 2.1% at $58.02. As speculation continues over where banks based in London and elsewhere in the UK might choose to settle after Brexit, we hear today from the boss of American bank JP Morgan. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, has been speaking about his hopes for the investment bank\u2019s UK operations once Brexit becomes a reality to Financial News. Dimon said he worries Brexit will have repercussions for the rest of the European Union. \u201cA major fear to me about Brexit is that it causes the EU to fail down the road,\u201d he told Financial News in the interview at JP Morgan\u2019s Victoria Embankment offices in London. Financial News says Dimon also proclaimed a \u201clove\u201d for London, but provided no reassurance that JP Morgan wouldn\u2019t move business from the City to the continent after Brexit takes effect. \u201cI wish we could keep it all here [in London],\u201d said Dimon. \u201cI think it\u2019s very good for Europe.\u201d The full interview is available here. Ahead of the June referendum, JP Morgan was among the big banks warning that a vote to leave would cost jobs. It said 4,000 jobs could go. The FTSE 100 has not managed to hold on to all its earlier gains, when it pushed through the 7,200 mark, but still looks on track for another record close. The index of London-listed bluechips is currently up 31 points at 7,174, having closed at an all-time high of 7,142.83 on Friday, the last trading day of 2016. The futures market is also pointing to a strong start to 2017 for Wall Street. Much of the support for the FTSE has come from the weak pound, which is down sharply since last June\u2019s Brexit vote. The weak pound flatters the earnings of those FTSE 100 companies that report in dollars. It has also helped those firms who export from Britain and it makes assets priced in pounds more attractive to foreign investors. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex expects the FTSE 100 to remain in positive territory in afternoon trading but said the pound\u2019s strength was limiting gains. He also expects gains on Wall Street for the Dow Jones industrial average index. Campbell commented: It appears that this morning\u2019s December manufacturing PMI reading... hampered the FTSE\u2019s record-breaking surge by giving a boost to the pound. In the aftermath of the PMI release sterling jumped 0.6% against the euro, taking it back above 1.18 for the first time in a week and a half; this was enough to temper the FTSE\u2019s growth, despite the fact that the pound is continuing to struggle against the dollar... Looking ahead to this afternoon and following a bitterly disappointing end to 2016 that saw the index fail to break 20,000 the Dow Jones is set to recover some of its losses this Tuesday. The Dow futures are suggesting the index will reclaim around 150 points, pushing it above 19900 and putting that elusive landmark level back on the cards. The upbeat PMI report on the UK\u2019s manufacturing industry caught City analysts off guard. But they have been quick to point out the divergence between the PMI survey and official data which paints a gloomier picture of the factory sector and many also highlight the threat that higher inflation in 2017 will squeeze consumer spending, the biggest driver of economic growth in the UK. The outlook remains one of a marked slowdown for the UK economy this year, says James Knightley, senior economist at the bank ING. He commented: This [the PMI reading] is the strongest figure since June 2014 and again suggests that the Brexit referendum has not harmed the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector. In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound against other major currencies has boosted the UK\u2019s competitiveness on the international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export orders performing well. However, sterling\u2019s fall also means that imported components are more expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 2017 from 2.2% in 2016. A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland, reports Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the \u2018British Irish Gateway to Trade\u2019 service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea. Britain remains Ireland\u2019s biggest trading partner with business between the UK and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce. Its chairman John McGrane said the network would promote more growth in trade between Ireland and the UK in the face of the Brexit challenge. McGrane said: At a time when businesses are preparing for Brexit, they appreciate a resource like BIG which helps them to grow their business by being introduced to more customers and suppliers across the UK and Ireland\u201d. 2017 will focus all our minds on the importance of the trade between Britain and Ireland which supports over 400,000 jobs. Firms on both sides of the Irish Sea are looking for more trading opportunities and this new service supports the work of Chambers and the various state agencies to make those connections easier to find for businesses north south east and west. The new service lets businesses find the trading partners they want within a trusted network of like-minded firms across the two islands. The full story: More reaction to the strong UK manufacturing PMI. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doesn\u2019t believe it will last. UK manufacturing is benefiting from both continued brisk growth in domestic demand as well as improving global demand, but this momentum likely will peter out in 2017. The pick-up in the total orders balance to 58.5 from 55.2 suggests manufacturing output will continue to grow briskly over the next couple of months. Meanwhile, the fact that the UK\u2019s PMI exceeds those for the eurozone and U.S., 54.9 and 54.2 respectively, signals that the UK economy is continuing to marginally outperform. The relationship between the PMI and the official data, however, has been particularly loose lately; the PMI has signalled steady growth in manufacturing output since August, but the official data have oscillated around a flat trend. Meanwhile, we continue to think that domestic demand for manufactured goods will crumble as consumers experience a renewed squeeze on their real incomes, driven mainly by higher import prices. At the same time, the boost to growth from sterling\u2019s depreciation will remain relatively modest, because exporters have raised sterling prices sharply and because uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trade relationships will deter exporters from investing. Oil prices have pushed even higher, to 18-month highs, boosted by hopes that a deal to cut production between Opec and non-Opec producers such as Russia will diminish the global oil glut. Brent crude jumped about 2.5% to $58.37 a barrel, the highest since July 2015. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: December\u2019s UK Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI provides further evidence that the sector\u2019s post-referendum weakness will prove short-lived... A rise in overall new orders to a two-and-a-half year high suggests that the strength in manufacturing activity will continue in the coming months. Admittedly, the fall in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures. Indeed, despite falling back from 79.1 in November to 76.9 in December, the input prices balance remained well above its long-run average (55.1). Nonetheless, on the basis of past form, the three-month average of the survey\u2019s output balance is consistent with a quarterly rise in manufacturing output of about 1% in Q4, following Q3\u2019s 0.8% contraction. This is consistent with other survey evidence, such as the CBI\u2019s Industrial Trends Survey, which suggest that the manufacturing sector gained some momentum at the end of 2016 too. That said, given the sharp monthly fall in October in the official figures, even a large increase in output in November and December would probably not be enough to lead to a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q4. A stronger end to the quarter would, however, provide a good base for manufacturing growth in Q1. As such, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced in the quarters ahead. Sterling jumped to a two-week high against the euro after the strong manufacturing survey. It hit 84.71p per euro, up 0.5%. Against the dollar, the pound rose to $1.2290. The FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.8% earlier this morning, is only 0.4% ahead now at 7173.12, a gain of some 30 points. All the main sub-indices were strong. New export business rose for the seventh month in December. Companies secured new orders from the US, Europe, China, the Middle East, India and other Asian markets. Employment rose for the fifth month in December, with the pace of jobs growth picking up to the fastest in 14 months, especially at smaller and medium-sized firms. Rates of inflation for input costs and prices charged both remained among the fastest seen during the survey\u2019s history, but slowed from October\u2019s highs. UK factories ended 2016 on a strong note, according to the Markit/CIPS manufacturing survey. The December reading of 56.1, a 30-month high, is up from 53.6 in November and well above its long-run average of 51.5. Rising domestic and overseas demand has boosted output and companies\u2019 order books. Price pressures remained elevated but eased from recent highs. The UK manufacturing PMI has hit the highest level since June 2014, rising to 56.1 \u2013 better than expected. Oil prices are pushing higher this morning, helping underpin gains in the FTSE 100. Brent crude is up 82 cents, or 1.4%, at $57.64, not far below the 2016 high of $57.89, hit on 12 December. US light crude is trading 72 cents higher at $54.44, a 1.3% gain. 1 January marked the official start of a recently agreed deal between the oil cartel Opec and other exporters such as Russia to reduce output by almost 1.8m barrels a day. Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, told Reuters: First signals suggest the Opec and non-Opec production cuts are raising hops that the global oil oversupply will diminish. The number of unemployed people in Germany has fallen for a third month in a row, declining by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 in December from the previous month to 2.638 million. Economists had expected a drop of 5,000. Germany\u2019s Federal Statistics Office also said that the jobless rate was unchanged at 6%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990. 2016 was a good year for vinyl, when sales reached a 25-year high, as LPs continue their comeback. Hannah Ellis-Petersen writes: More than 3.2m LPs were sold last year, a rise of 53% on last year and the highest number since 1991 when Simply Red\u2019s Stars was the bestselling album. This was also the first year that spending on vinyl outstripped that spent on digital downloads. The deaths of some music world giants was a key driver in vinyl sales, as people invested in records as a mementos. After David Bowie\u2019s death he became the bestselling vinyl artist of 2016, with five albums posthumously featuring in the top 30. We have published our share tips for 2017, including Tesco, Diageo, Dairy Crest, Flybe and Shire. Last year our tips didn\u2019t do so well, alas. Looking back at 2016, our markets reporter Nick Fletcher writes: It\u2019s a cliche \u2013 and true enough \u2013 that stock markets hate uncertainty, which is one possible explanation for why investors shrugged off the shock of Brexit and the even bigger shock of a Donald Trump presidency. At least there was an element of knowing where we stood, in the near term at least. In a volatile 12 months, the FTSE 100 slumped to three-and-a-half-year lows in February on fears of a global economic slowdown, recovered, then fell sharply but briefly following the EU referendum vote, before hitting new heights as a drop in the pound boosted the index\u2019s overseas earners and a rise in oil prices lifted commodity companies. It finally ended the year at a record 7,142, up 14.4%. The manufacturing PMI for Japan has come in weak, suggesting factory activity is shrinking at a faster rate. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has sent us his thoughts. Continuing the push it saw at the very end of 2016 the UK index is already eyeing the 7200 mark, a 50 point-plus rise leaving it within striking distance of that landmark level. For now, at least, investors are ignoring the potentially disruptive events littered across 2017 \u2013 most pertinent to the FTSE being March\u2019s triggering of Article 50 and the impending announcements related to the banking sector\u2019s decision whether or not to stay in the UK post-Brexit \u2013 to get behind the UK index. Helping the FTSE is the performance of Brent crude which, at just above $57 per barrel, is at its best price in around 18 months, something that has secured some solid growth in the commodity sector as the New Year gets underway. The FTSE does, however, get its first 2017-test this morning in the form of December\u2019s manufacturing PMI; analysts are expecting the figure to dip slightly month-on-month, from 53.4 to 53.3. Any negative news will likely be absorbed by the pound, which is sitting flat just above a 2-month, sub $1.23 low against the dollar. Shares in London continue to climb on the first trading day of the year, pushing the FTSE 100 up briefly to 7,202.44, a fresh record high. It is now 0.8% ahead, not far below the 7,200 mark. Mining stocks Glencore and Anglo American, which have benefited hugely from the weak pound in the past year, are among the biggest risers today, as is Intercontinental Hotels, after a rating upgrade from Barclays. Retailer Next is the biggest faller, down 3.2%, after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d. European equity markets are also up for a second day. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has risen 0.75% to 365.89, the highest level since December 2015. Italian banks are among the top gainers, with the newly-merged Banco BPM gaining 4.6% in early trading. Economists at Daiwa said: With Spanish inflation on the EU harmonised measure released last Friday surprising notably on the upside, rising 0.9ppt to 1.4% year-on-year, a near-3\u00bd-year high, the equivalent flash euro area figure due tomorrow is expected to rise 0.4ppt to 1.0%Y/Y, which would be the highest in since September 2013. Nevertheless, given the continued lack of underlying cost pressures, euro area core CPI is expected to be unchanged at just 0.8%Y/Y, for the fifth consecutive month. In the eurozone, the focus today is on the flash estimates of December inflation figures from Germany and France as well as German unemployment data. The French numbers are already out \u2013 inflation rose at an annual rate of 0.8% last month, the highest since May 2014, driven by higher food and energy prices while services inflation slipped back. The German data are expected to show an annual inflation rate of 1.3%, which would be the strongest since 2013. We are also getting German unemployment data this morning. Economists are forecasting a small fall of 5,000 in the number of jobless people, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 6%. European stock markets have also opened higher. The Dax in Frankfurt and the Ibex in Madrid are both 0.3% ahead while the CAC in Paris and the FTSE MiB in Milan have gained 0.5%. The FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the open, rising more than 27 points to 7170.65, a 0.4% rise. On the corporate front, the London Stock Exchange is selling its 50% stake in the French clearing arm of LCH Clearnet to Euronext, which runs several European exchanges, in a \u20ac510m (\u00a3433m) deal. Both companies have agreed on the terms of Euronext\u2019s all-cash offer. The LSE is offloading its stake in LCH in an attempt to ward off anti-trust concerns raised by the European commission over its proposed \u00a321bn mega-merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the operator of the German stock exchange. Read the full story here. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes that slowing growth in real incomes (adjusted for inflation) will define the UK economy this year. He says that income growth is unlikely to keep up with rising inflation, caused by the sharp slide in the pound which is pushing up the price of imported raw materials and other goods. The UK economy retained its momentum last year, despite the seismic shock of the vote to leave the EU. Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth averaged 0.5% in the first three quarters of 2016, matching 2015\u2019s rate and the average pace of growth across the Atlantic. So far, surveys and official data point to growth of about 0.4% in Q4. The economy\u2019s strength, however, has relied on consumers, who will not be able to raise spending much further in 2017 as the consequences of the Brexit vote unfold... The jobs data already have begun to lose their shine; employment fell by 6K in the three months to October, the first decline since mid-2015. The numbers often are erratic, but the deterioration in surveys of employment intentions and a small decline in the number of vacancies points to a clear slowdown in job growth. In addition, we expect no serious increase in wage growth, which likely will remain close to 2.5% this year. Employers are responding to rising materials costs by squeezing pay; the median basic pay deal was just 1.6% in the three months to November, down from 2% in the first half of the year, according to XpertHR... Households\u2019 real incomes look set to stagnate this year, following increases of 3.6% in 2015 and 2% in 2016. Investec economist Chris Hare is expecting a slight uptick in the UK factory index today, to a healthy 53.6. It dropped unexpectedly in November to 53.4 from October\u2019s revised 54.2, the second monthly decline. Anything above 50 indicates expansion while a reading below points to contraction. He says: The decline on the month is no cause for panic though \u2013 the index still remains above levels that prevailed in the months before the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU and is also still above its long run average level. Indeed, we expect the read from the manufacturing sector to remain fairly elevated over the coming months \u2013 exporters should continue to benefit from post-referendum falls in the pound. Over time, that should more than offset the adverse effect of higher import costs. Meanwhile, we would note that businesses have largely shrugged off the economic uncertainty associated with the post-Brexit vote environment. Good morning, and Happy New Year. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The FTSE 100 ended 2016 at a record high of 7,142.83 after a surge in mining stocks and dollar earners, which dominate the index. The pound has lost 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote in June, benefiting those companies that make most of their money overseas. The UK market reopens today after yesterday\u2019s bank holiday closure \u2013 the first trading day of 2017. The highlight is the UK manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index for December, which will shed more light on how industry has fared since the referendum. European stock markets got off to a good start yesterday after strong manufacturing reports. The manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 54.9 last month, the highest since April 2011, boosted by Germany, France and Italy. German factory growth rose to close to a three-year high thanks to rising demand from Asia and the US. French manufacturing hit a five-and-a-half-year high, while in Italy factories grew at their fastest rate since June.",

                "bodyText":"The FTSE100 is still pretty much flat, due to the hammering that retail stocks are taking on the back of Next\u2019s disappointing update. The blue-chip index needs to finish above 7177.89 to set a new record. Over on Wall Street, there\u2019s a slim chance the Dow Jones could smash through the 20,000 barrier for the first time. The oil price was 0.27% higher at $55.62 by mid afternoon and the pound is doing a bit better against the dollar, up around 0.4% at $1.228. The main economic news of the day is that the UK construction industry enjoyed the fastest growth in new orders in almost a year in December, according to the latest PMI survey. And the Bank of England said consumer credit staged its fastest monthly rise since March 2005 in November. With that, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great comments. Shall we do it again tomorrow? Why not. The Dow Jones has flirted shamelessly with the magic 20,000 mark in recent weeks, edging tantalisingly close before falling away again, the big tease. Over on Wall Street, the Dow is up 23 points in early trading at 19,905. Someone needs to get their wallet out if the long-awaited watermark is going to be breached today. One last piece on retailer Next\u2019s gloomy 2017 forecast now and it\u2019s our financial editor Nils Pratley, who is always a must-read. A trading update and pessimistic 2017 forecast from Next has made grim reading for retail investors today, dragging shares in high street chains down across the board. The firm laid the blame in part at the weakness of sterling since the EU referendum vote in June. Now the chain\u2019s chief executive Simon Wolfson, one of the most prominent Brexiteers in the business world, has asked for greater clarity from the government. He wants the government to flesh out some of the core principles that will underpin negotiations with the remaining EU members, particularly on immigration. It would be helpful to understand the principles and objectives of the government with which they are going to enter negotiations. Here\u2019s more detail on Lord Wolfson\u2019s call to arms. Trigger-happy tweeting may have helped Donald Trump win the US presidency but how will it affect his relationship with some of the big-hitters on the US business scene? The Guardian business desk\u2019s very own US expert Rupert Neate takes a look at how Trump\u2019s industrial strategy could unfold, if his social media strategy is anything to go by. Dollar Libor, the interest rate at which banks lend each other dollars, has risen above 1% for the first time since May 2009. The rise has been fuelled by last month\u2019s signal from the Federal Reserve that it could raise interest rates three times in 2017, with employment and inflation both on the up. Businesses are also hoping to benefit if Donald Trump, backed by a Republican Congress, embarks on a series of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and dismantling regulation. The Libor rate for three-month dollars hit 1.00511%, for those who were wondering about the figure to five decimal places. Libor, better known for its role in the Libor scandal that has seen bankers imprisoned and lenders forced to pay billions in fines, is used to calculate around $350tn of financial transactions worldwide. It seems our economics editor Larry Elliott isn\u2019t the only one sounding a warning about Britons embarking on a credit binge. Debt charity StepChange says Theresa May\u2019s government should be concerned by a lending boom unparalleled since the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Here\u2019s what the charity\u2019s head of policy Peter Tutton has to say. Lenders, regulators and the government need to ensure that the mistakes made in the lead-up to the financial crisis are not repeated and that there are better policies in place to protect those who fall into financial difficulty. Our economics editor Larry Elliott warns shoppers may be storing up trouble for the future by embarking on a borrowing binge. It follows the release of lending figures from the Bank of England, which showed that consumer credit has staged its fastest monthly rise since March 2005. After Next posted a grim trading update earlier, retailers have taken a knock on the FTSE100, with Marks &amp; Spencer, Primark owner Associated British Foods, Burberry and Debenhams all out of favour among traders. To the untrained eye, sales figures for the last week of 2016 at department store chain John Lewis will only add to the gloom. Sales for the week to 31 December were down 9.4% on last year to \u00a3138.5m at John Lewis and fell 12.5% to \u00a3110m at the firm\u2019s grocery store business Waitrose. However, the timing of Christmas means John Lewis has undersold its true performance. There was one fewer trading day in the final week of 2016 than in 2015, so the numbers are not nearly as bad as they seem. Indeed, including all 22 weeks to the end of the year, Waitrose sales grew by 3.3% and John Lewis was up by 4.2%. Let\u2019s catch up with Eurozone inflation data from earlier, which showed inflation in December hitting 1.1%, the highest level for three years and a sharp jump on the 0.6% reported in November. Price rises are largely down to increases in the cost of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. The European Central Bank (ECB) set a target for inflation of just below 2%, a level ECB president Mario Draghi has said could be reached as soon as late 2018. A quick update on the FTSE100, which strayed into negative territory earlier but is back up, albeit marginally. The blue-chip index closed at an all-time high of 7177.89 and is presently up nearly seven points at 7185, putting it on course to post another record. That\u2019s despite a bleak trading session for retailers, most of which have tanked after Next issued a dismal trading update. It\u2019s coming up to noon, which means that the average FTSE100 boss has already earned \u00a328,200 so far in 2017, matching what the average person will earn for the entire year. The unofficial title of this momentous occasion is Fat Cat Wednesday. Every penny richly deserved, of course. Some more reaction to the Bank of England consumer credit update for November has arrived. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has been digging into the numbers. Such rapid growth in unsecured credit is unsustainable over the medium-term, and the recent fall back in consumer confidence suggests that households will borrow more cautiously in 2017, subduing growth in consumption. Meanwhile, the negligible rise in mortgage approvals shows that the boost to activity from the recent fall in mortgage rates has been modest. Approvals still are 3% below the average level of the first half of 2016, and they likely will struggle to recover further over coming months. The rise in market interest rates since October suggests that lenders soon will increase mortgage rates slightly, while the outlook for stagnation in households\u2019 real incomes this year, as job growth slows and inflation rebounds, will mean that affordability constraints start to bite. Here\u2019s a handy graph showing growth rates in consumer credit, going back to the start of the 21st century. Here\u2019s our story on the results of the PMI survey of UK construction for December. Coming hot on the heels of a strong manufacturing PMI yesterday, the latest update offers a better-than-expected picture of the state of the economy as we move into 2017. Next\u2019s trading update was a gloomy way to kick off the year for retailers, but Scunthorpe-based convenience store specialist Nisa Retail is ticking along nicely. Christmas trading in the 10 weeks to the 1st January 2017 showed sales up 2.7% to \u00a3235.6m, delivering underlying profit for the period of \u00a3718,000 compared to \u00a3520,000 for the same period of 2015. Nisa was boosted by growth in fresh produce, which it put down to leading the way on \u201cfestive vegetable pricing\u201d. More detailed information on Nisa\u2019s trading update can be found here. Consumer credit staged its fastest monthly rise since March 2005, according to the Bank of England. Net lending in November jumped by \u00a31.9bn, up from \u00a31.68bn in October and ahead of expectations. Mortgage approvals hit 67,505 compared to 67,731 in October, the highest rate since March 2016. Mark Dyason of Edinburgh Mortgage Advice reckons the increase in mortgage approvals is partly down to people borrowing now in the expectation that rates will rise, making home loans more expensive. The sense that time is running out on the best rates, coupled with a general softening in prices, especially in prime areas of the country, has kept the market ticking over. Ironically, the ongoing uncertainty around the full impact of Brexit has spurred many people into action. The philosophy many people have adopted appears to be one of take action now while conditions are at least in their favour. While the number of approvals looks strong, the actual amount undershot expectations. The Bank of England recorded \u00a33.15bn of net mortgage lending in November, below expectations of \u00a33.5bn and the lowest level since August last year. Some more reaction to the UK construction PMI survey data now, this time from Mike Chappell, of Lloyds Bank\u2019s construction team. As this data reflects, the construction firms we speak to are still relatively upbeat. Yet there is some uncertainty as we begin the first quarter of the year given the likelihood of Article 50 being triggered. To try and create stability many contractors are focussing on managing risks, for example through joint ventures. These suit both construction businesses and client by sharing risk and minimising the impact of one firm being unable to fulfil a contract. In terms of pipelines, the current political focus on infrastructure is welcomed by contractors but while they are optimistic about the potential of mega-projects like Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2, they are hard-wired not to pin their hopes on any schemes until shovels hit the ground. Here is the assessment of Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the Markit/CIPS construction PMI, which showed strong growth for the UK construction industry in December. December\u2019s survey data confirmed a solid rebound in UK construction output during the final quarter of 2016. All three main areas of construction activity have started to recover from last summer\u2019s soft patch, but in each case growth remains much weaker than the cyclical peaks seen in 2014. Housebuilding remains a key engine of growth for the construction sector, with the latest upturn the fastest for almost one year. Meanwhile, commercial activity was the weakest performing category in December, reflecting an ongoing drag from subdued investment spending and heightened economic uncertainty. So what\u2019s the bad news, Tim? The main negative development in December was a sustained acceleration in input cost inflation to its strongest since 2011. UK construction companies noted that the weaker sterling exchange rate had resulted in higher costs for a wide range of imported materials, while some also reported that forward purchasing of inputs had led to depleted stocks among suppliers. The UK construction sector PMI survey result came in at 54.2 for December, a decent increase on the 52.8 registered in November. IHS Markit/CIPS, who release the survey numbers each month, call it a \u201crobust and accelerated expansion\u201d of the sector. However, there is a note of caution here, as the price that suppliers charge construction firms for imported raw materials has increased due to the weakness of sterling. IHS Markit/CIPS warn this is putting \u201cintense cost pressures\u201d on construction firms. The rise in input costs was the steepest for just over five and a half years. Just time for a quick check on what analysts are saying about Next\u2019s pessimistic outlook, while we wait for the PMI survey of how UK construction is doing. The folk at ETX Capital thinks Next\u2019s woes may signal problems may tell us more about problems specific to the company than the state of play on the rest of the high street. This is a worry for all retailers but the simple problem is that Next is underperforming the market. UK retail sales have held up in the months following the Brexit vote but Next has suffered. It\u2019s been suffering for a while and needs a turnaround plan. Indeed, driven by a surge in clothing sales, the October figures from the Office for National Statistics showed retail sales growth at a 14-year high. Today\u2019s BRC-Nielsen shop price index also shows that deflation eased in December. The brand is struggling for relevancy and risks going the way of Marks &amp; Spencer on the clothing front, appealing to an ever-narrower customer base. Compare it to H&amp;M or Zara, which continue to notch up strong sales growth year-over-year, and you can see its place on the high street is being squeezed. That\u2019s a fairly bruising assessment for poor old Next. However, George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, thinks other high street names will be feeling the pinch too. That\u2019s a view shared by many in the market, given this morning\u2019s bloodbath among retail stocks. Despite hopes of a more positive Christmas for the retailers, Next\u2019s results have set the tone for what is likely to be a difficult reporting season. Results from the keenly-watched PMI survey of the services sector shows decent growth for the Eurozone as a whole. The the index came in at 53.7 for December, ahead of a predicted 53.1, where anything above 50 means bosses in the industry think activity has increased. Wrapping the services result into what we already know about other sectors of the Eurozone economy gives us an index of 54.4, the best result since May 2011. And now to Germany, where activity in the services sector is purring along at a very decent clip indeed. Europe\u2019s largest economy registered a PMI index of 54.3 in the service sector, ahead of a forecast of 53.8. That means a composite figure for the wider German economy of 55.2, beating a forecast that the index would remain flat at 54.8. Wunderbar! A reminder that PMI surveys are an indicator of how bosses in key sectors think business activity is shaping up, rather than hard data on actual transactions. France\u2019s services sector is doing slightly better than its Italian counterpart, according to PMI survey data. The index hit 52.9, beating forecasts of 52.6. Now that we\u2019ve got data from the services sector, we can put together a composite picture of sentiment in the wider French economy. The composite figure reached 53.1, above a prediction of 52.8. Pas mal. Here comes the first batch of PMI survey results from Europe\u2019s services sector and Italy is first out of the blocks with figures for December. It\u2019s underwhelming news. The Italian services sector PMI came in at 52.3, compared to expectations of 52.6. That means the index of the overall Italian economy stands at 52.9, below a forecast of 53. Remember, anything above 50 indicates growth but performance relative to forecasts is crucial for market sentiment. Here\u2019s the full story on Next, as Julia Kollewe digs into the retailer\u2019s disappointing numbers. Here\u2019s what retail analysts at RBC Capital Markets have to say about that dismal statement from Next. We think Next retail sales growth is continuing to be affected by a tough UK clothing sector, a shift to online and its very high margins versus peers. Next has also guided to inflation pressures on its cost base including higher labour, business rates and energy taxes. In addition it intends to add around \u00a310m to its cost base in order to improve its website systems and online marketing. Although we see potential for further cost savings in warehouse and labour costs, we think Next remains exposed to potential volume disappointments next year owing to price rises and as the competition has largely caught up online, plus we see a risk of further margin pressure owing to higher discounting. Meanwhile, a slew of other retailers are feeling the heat as stock-pickers take a look at Next\u2019s numbers and assume we\u2019ll be seeing similar from its rivals. Half an hour into the day\u2019s trading and Marks &amp; Spencer is the second-biggest FTSE faller, off 4.5%, with Primark owner Associated British Foods down 3.7% and Tesco losing 1.5%. On the FTSE250, Debenhams is the worst off, some 4% lower. All in all, not a good day to be a High Street clothing store, or someone with shares in one. Often billed as the bellwether of the UK fashion industry, Next has cut its profit forecast for 2016 and warns of tough times in 2017 to boot. It says the weak pound will contribute to rising prices for clothes, eating into consumers\u2019 spending power. The gloomy assessment has triggered a fall of more than 13% in Next\u2019s shares during early FTSE trading. The High Street chain is being followed into the doldrums by fellow retailers Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer. Here is what Next had to say about the reason for its travails:- The fact that sales continued to decline in quarter four, beyond the anniversary of the start of the slowdown in November 2015, means that we expect the cyclical slow-down in spending on clothing and footwear to continue into next year. In addition to this effect, there are two further factors which may depress sales: We may see a further squeeze in general spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth. As previously indicated, following the devaluation of the pound, we expect prices on like-for-like garments to rise, but by no more than 5%. We expect that this will depress sales revenue by around 0.5%. The fashion chain\u2019s chief executive Lord Wolfson is among the most prominent business figures to back the Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum, which triggered a steep fall in the value of sterling. In the first few minutes of trading, the FTSE100 edged up from yesterday\u2019s all-time record close of 7177.89 but it has taken a bit of a knock due to a fairly dismal update on sales and profit forecasts from fashion retailer Next, which is down an eye-watering 11% in early trading. This is what the folks at trading firm IG Index think we\u2019ll see as European stock markets open. It looks like smiles all round at trading desks in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Another all-time record could be on the cards for the FTSE100 today and its chances of hitting new highs would be boosted by some heartening news on the construction sector. Closely-watched construction PMI survey results for December are due at 9.30am, offering an insight into how decision-makers in the industry think things are going. November\u2019s result beat expectations, with the index showing a figure of 52.8, up from 52.6 the previous month, where anything above 50 represents growth. Yesterday\u2019s manufacturing PMI came in at a 30-month high, so another good result could catapult the FTSE past yesterday\u2019s all-time high of 7177.89. Markets are also watching out for the latest Eurozone PMI survey of the services sector, released at 9am. On the High Street, a trading update from Next makes for grim reading for fashionistas. The firm sounded a warning that clothes prices will be higher due to the weak pound and sales forecasts have been reined in as a result. We\u2019ll bring you all the latest as it emerges.",

A sizeable majority of the profession expected a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c58599e-d0f1-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0\">vote for Brexit </a>would rapidly hit Britain\u2019s economic performance and we now know this to be wrong. For some, such as Michael Gove, the prominent Brexiter, the error is sufficient proof of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38138820\">politically motivated groupthink</a> to justify dismissing economists almost entirely. For others, the error requires economists to confess they know very little about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05c98c0e-b251-11e6-a37c-f4a01f1b0fa1\">macroeconomy</a>.</p> <p>Both responses are dangerous non sequiturs. A far better response is to admit to the error, understand what went wrong and learn lessons.</p> <p>Excuses should be avoided. It is not good enough to say most forecasts were based on an assumption of an immediate UK notification of Article 50 and the Bank of England leaving policy unchanged. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit\">Brexit</a> uncertainty exists regardless of when the UK informs the EU of its intention to leave \u2014 and monetary policy operates with a long delay.</p> <p>In fact, we know the predominant source of error. It stemmed from underestimating the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c061e51a-c8f5-11e6-9043-7e34c07b46ef\">strength of household consumption </a>after the vote for Brexit. Economists expected a vote to leave would increase household savings in the short term, both as precautionary insurance against uncertainty and to begin an adjustment to a less prosperous future.</p> <p>These were reasonable guesses, based on recent household behaviour \u2014 for example, at the time of huge banking uncertainty early in 2008. But rather than rising, household savings fell throughout 2016. The savings ratio dropped to an exceptionally low level in the third quarter as consumers went on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7ccbf80-d264-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51\">borrowing and spending</a> binge not seen since before the financial crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>But why has consumer spending been so strong?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The interesting question is why households acted in this way. There are three plausible reasons. First, households correctly thought Brexit would improve their personal finances and borrowed and spent accordingly. Second, they were deceived into expecting economic gains from Brexit and still went out to spend. And, third, households watched sterling tumble, understood the likely effect on prices and brought forward their consumption, so they were spending in the knowledge their money would buy less in future.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:41:09.819Z\">at 1.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-586e488ee4b081b2b4eda569\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:25:40.946Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BOE's Haldane: 2017 harder for consumers than 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some Reuters flashes on Haldane: He said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to think this year will be harder for consumers than 2016, and that higher UK inflation would likely lead to slowing consumer spending, although he added that was not inevitable.</p> <p>He also said that consumers last year behaved almost as though the Brexit vote had never happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c655772501b810068f4aee85c4c8a11f4c71d1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c655772501b810068f4aee85c4c8a11f4c71d1c/0_247_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Haldane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Haldane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:26:23.096Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-586e4713e4b081b2b4eda565\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T13:22:02.078Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking about productivity and other matters at the Institute for Government.

Prices are down 12.5% since their 2014 peak.</p> <p>Higher property taxes coupled with political and economic uncertainty have been dragging down prices. Savills is forecasting zero growth over the next couple of years.</p> <p>In outer prime London, where the average value is just below \u00a32m, prices fell 4% last year and are just 2.7% down from where they were two years ago.</p> <p>Savills collected data that suggests from January to the end of November there were around 320 sales worth over \u00a35m in London, with a total of over \u00a33.7bn spent. The number of sales was 17% below the same 11 month period of 2015.</p> <p>Contrary to some reports, the very top end of the market has been more active than in 2015. In the 11 months to the end of November \u00a31.43bn was spent on properties worth over \u00a320m compared to \u00a31.07bn in 2015.</p> <p>Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We saw a real dearth of transactions over the late spring and summer months following the race to beat the new 3% surcharge [stamp duty]. But further price adjustments, coupled with the currency play for international buyers, appear to have triggered greater buyer commitment and prime London sales volumes picked up significantly in September, October and November before easing back in December.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he cautioned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Buyer sentiment remains fragile. Improved transaction levels are the result of adjusted pricing and should not be seen as a precursor to price rises in the foreseeable future. High stamp duty rates and the uncertainty created by negotiations to leave Europe will still need to be factored into expectations on value.</p> </blockquote> <p>The forecast is for prime central London growth to total 21% in the five years to the end of 2021.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09269889663bc694d81e1381bacfbae59f1a3212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09269889663bc694d81e1381bacfbae59f1a3212/0_1441_2574_1543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grosvenor Crescent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grosvenor Crescent</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T09:31:22.108Z\">at 9.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-586e04c4e4b081b2b4eda447\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-05T08:35:54.008Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the British car industry is warning of a sales downturn this year as the economic uncertainty that followed the Brexit vote kicks in. <em>Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes:</em></p> <p>A fifth consecutive year of growth saw nearly 2.7m new car registrations in the UK last year, a rise of 2.2% on 2015.

It is expected to show a slight easing in activity, to 54.8 from 55.2. Anything above the 50 mark indicates expansion. The sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/uk-manufacturing-growth-at-a-30-month-high-says-pmi-survey\">surveys for manufacturing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/uk-construction-industry-growth-new-orders\">construction showed both sectors growing at a robust clip</a>, suggesting the economy was stronger than many expected in the fourth quarter, despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p><strong>The Irish services PMI is already out.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 is trading 15 points higher at 7,205.35, putting it on track for yet another all-time closing high. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are broadly flat, while the Dow on Wall Street is slightly down, trading just below the historic 20,000 mark. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Dennis de Jong, managing director at online forex broker UFX.com, was quick to react to the survey data. The US services industry accounts for two-thirds of the country\u2019s economic output, so the above-expectations ISM non-manufacturing PMI for December will please Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed, especially as it comes on the back of broadly encouraging financial data of recent weeks. The US economy was remarkably resilient in the face of growing uncertainty during 2016, and the markets reacted positively to Donald Trump\u2019s election in November. With the president-elect now just weeks away from the White House, the challenge is to deliver the growth he has promised. The Dow Jones is still in negative territory, but has improved slightly from the open. It is now down 8 points at 19,934.68. The closely watched ISM survey for the US has come in stronger than expected. The non-manufacturing sector PMI, from the Institute for Supply Management, rose to 57.2 in December from 57.2 in November. The new orders sub-index jumped from 57 to 51.6, the highest since August 2015. Another piece of labour market data from the US, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s key non-farm payrolls: the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped 28,000 to 235,000 last week, according to the US Labour Department \u2013 close to the 233,000 touched in November, a 43-year low. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has opened nearly 14 points lower at 19,928.41, as expected \u2013 its first lower open in 2017. It got tantalisingly close to the historic 20,000 mark yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have both slipped a couple of points. Here in London, the FTSE 100 is now more than 10 points ahead at 7,201.18, a 0.16% gain, and could get to another record close today. It would be the sixth in a row. The longest run of all-time closing highs (eight in a row) was in May 1997. The Haldane event has now finished. Back to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane, who is answering questions at the Institute for Government, a think tank. He said the central bank was keeping an eye on the recent strong growth in consumer lending but saw no need for alarm. You\u2019ll have seen and read from our Financial Policy Committee that this is something that they\u2019re keeping a close... eye on. And they are right to do so. Nonetheless, we need to put all this in a bit of context. Aggregate borrowing by households isn\u2019t tearing away right now. We\u2019ve gone through a long period where borrowing, both by companies and households, has actually been rather subdued. US stocks are set for their first lower open of the year, following the weaker-than-expected jobs data and the minutes of the last Fed meeting. Almost every Fed policymaker thought Donald Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and infrastructure spending could stoke higher inflation, which could force the central bank to step up rate hikes this year. The Dow Jones has been flirting with the 20,000 mark for weeks but future markets suggest it will open 15 points lower today. It has never broken through that level before. It closed at 19,942.16 yesterday. Over in the US, the ADP National Employment Report (from payrolls processor ADP) indicated that employers in the private sector created 153,000 jobs last month, below Wall Street forecasts of a job gain of 170,000. The figures come a day before the government\u2019s key non-farm payrolls data. US Treasury bond yields slipped on the news. Haldane reiterated the Bank of England\u2019s view that economic growth will slow a little while inflation will pick up materially this year, following the sharp fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum. That [higher inflation] will in turn produce something of a squeeze on the spending power of consumers and may lead them to throttle back somewhat in their spending plans. It might not happen, they might choose to run down their savings. But it\u2019s possible, indeed I\u2019d say likely that there will be something of a slowdown. You can watch the Haldane event live here. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist is answering questions at the Institute for Government. More from Andy Haldane. He sees a \u201cvery interesting disconnect\u201d between the political uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote and the strength of the stock market and the economy. Regarding the surprising strength of household spending, Chris Giles, the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, wrote this piece yesterday. Little is more fashionable at the start of 2017 than criticising UK economic expertise. A sizeable majority of the profession expected a vote for Brexit would rapidly hit Britain\u2019s economic performance and we now know this to be wrong. For some, such as Michael Gove, the prominent Brexiter, the error is sufficient proof of politically motivated groupthink to justify dismissing economists almost entirely. For others, the error requires economists to confess they know very little about the macroeconomy. Both responses are dangerous non sequiturs. A far better response is to admit to the error, understand what went wrong and learn lessons. Excuses should be avoided. It is not good enough to say most forecasts were based on an assumption of an immediate UK notification of Article 50 and the Bank of England leaving policy unchanged. Brexit uncertainty exists regardless of when the UK informs the EU of its intention to leave \u2014 and monetary policy operates with a long delay. In fact, we know the predominant source of error. It stemmed from underestimating the strength of household consumption after the vote for Brexit. Economists expected a vote to leave would increase household savings in the short term, both as precautionary insurance against uncertainty and to begin an adjustment to a less prosperous future. These were reasonable guesses, based on recent household behaviour \u2014 for example, at the time of huge banking uncertainty early in 2008. But rather than rising, household savings fell throughout 2016. The savings ratio dropped to an exceptionally low level in the third quarter as consumers went on a borrowing and spending binge not seen since before the financial crisis. But why has consumer spending been so strong? The interesting question is why households acted in this way. There are three plausible reasons. First, households correctly thought Brexit would improve their personal finances and borrowed and spent accordingly. Second, they were deceived into expecting economic gains from Brexit and still went out to spend. And, third, households watched sterling tumble, understood the likely effect on prices and brought forward their consumption, so they were spending in the knowledge their money would buy less in future. Some Reuters flashes on Haldane: He said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to think this year will be harder for consumers than 2016, and that higher UK inflation would likely lead to slowing consumer spending, although he added that was not inevitable. He also said that consumers last year behaved almost as though the Brexit vote had never happened. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking about productivity and other matters at the Institute for Government. The Bank of England hasn\u2019t released a text, but here are some tweets from journos and others who are there. Mike Ashley said: Keith has my full backing and will be continuing in his role on the basis that he has the unanimous support of the board. I note that many of those who voted against Keith have acknowledged that we have made positive progress since the AGM. At the group\u2019s annual meeting in September, 53% of the votes cast by independent shareholders opposed the chairman\u2019s re-election. Ashley wasn\u2019t allowed to vote at that meeting. The crisis at Sports Direct was triggered by a Guardian investigation in 2015, which revealed that workers at its giant Derbyshire warehouse were paid less than the national minimum wage. The scandal prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse, reigniting long-held concerns about the level of control Ashley enjoys at the company. News just in from the Sports Direct shareholder meeting at its Shirebrook headquarters. Chairman Keith Hellawell has survived another shareholder vote, despite growing opposition from investors such as Aberdeen Asset Management. The former chief constable been re-elected to the board with 80.9% of investors backing him and 19.1% voting against. Company founder Mike Ashley, who owns 55% of the company, was able to vote this time. However, nearly 54% of independent shareholders voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election, and only 46% backed him. My colleague Simon Goodley had previewed the meeting. The FTSE 100 has had a great run recently, thanks to the weakness of sterling, which has benefited all the dollar earners in the index. London\u2019s leading shares recorded all-time closing highs on the final three trading days of 2016 and continued their rally this week, closing at new peaks on Tuesday and Wednesday. (The market was closed on Monday, a Bank Holiday). The five consecutive record closes mean the FTSE is inching closer to the longest run of record closes in May 1997, when it notched up eight consecutive all-time closing highs. However the FTSE is trading over 3 points lower again at the moment. Time for a lunchtime round-up. European trading is somewhat lacklustre, as expected. The FTSE 100 in London hit another all-time high, of 7,211.96 this morning but is now barely in positive territory \u2013 trading 3 points higher at 7,192.68. The Dax in Frankfurt has slipped just over a point to 11,582.64 while the CAC in Paris is nearly 4 points ahead at 4,903.31. The final batch of UK PMI survey data was stronger than expected, and suggests the economy grew by a healthy 0.5% in the final three months of the year \u2013 down slightly from 0.6% in the previous quarter. Higher taxes and jitters over the EU referendum pushed down high-end London property prices last year as sellers accepted more \u201crealistic\u201d offers, according to upmarket estate agent Savills. The Bank of Cyprus has fully paid back the emergency funds it received from the European Central Bank during its crisis in 2013. The country\u2019s biggest lender said it had repaid the entire \u20ac11.4bn emergency liquidity assistance funding. Crude oil prices are rising again after reports that Saudi Arabia had embarked on discussions with customers about lowering crude sales by up to 7%, in an attempt to support efforts by the Opec cartel to reduce the global oil glut. The news swept away doubts that Opec wasn\u2019t serious about its November agreement to reduce production and wouldn\u2019t cut as much as promised. Brent crude is 28 cents ahead at $56.74 a barrel, a 0.5% gain. One source told Reuters: Aramco [The Saudi Arabian Oil Company] is approaching all its customers for possible cuts from February and discussing likely [supply] scenarios. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, agreed to cut output by 486,000 barrels per day. This amounts to 4.6% of its October production of 10.5m barrels. The new year is starting well for people working at Aldi: The German discounter is giving more than 3,000 staff a pay rise in an attempt to leapfrog rival Lidl to become the highest-paying supermarket in the UK. My colleague Rob Davies writes: Employees at the fast-growing supermarket chain will earn \u00a38.53 per hour and \u00a39.75 if they live in London, starting from 1 February. While Aldi\u2019s hourly rate in the capital will be the same as the new minimum announced in November by Lidl, staff outside London will earn 7p an hour more. Both supermarket chains have now matched or bettered the the voluntary minimum pay suggested by the Living Wage Foundation. The stories you need to read, in one handy emailRead more The weak performance of UK hotels and restaurants recorded in today\u2019s services survey is at odds with other data. New figures from VisitEngland out just now show that Brits spent \u00a345.3bn on day trips across England in the first 11 months of 2016, setting a new record for the survey. Spending is up 7% on the previous year. The number of day trips was also the highest ever, rising to 1.35bn, up 14% on the same period in 2015. VisityEngland is promoting day trips to Hull, the UK city of culture this year; the women\u2019s cricket world cup final at Lord\u2019s cricket ground; and the British Music Experience, which has moved from London to Liverpool and opens at the Cunard Building in February. My colleague on the economics desk Katie Allen has taken a close look at the strong UK services survey. ... and it\u2019s back in positive territory, just. Persimmon is leading gains this morning after a strong trading update, along with fellow housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt. Persimmon shares are nearly 6% ahead at \u00a319.13. The FTSE 100 has just turned negative, slipping just over 2 points to 7187.57. Much of its recent strength \u2013 it\u2019s had a run of five consecutive record closes \u2013 has been underpinned by the weaker pound, as many companies on the index are dollar earners. On the currency markets, sterling has recovered some ground against the dollar since the strong PMI data came out, to $1.2311. The dollar is also being knocked by a surge in China\u2019s yuan, prompted by a rise in overnight borrowing costs in Hong Kong. That triggered a broad round of profit taking on the greenback, Reuters reported \u2013 sending the dollar down by more than 1% against the yen and past $1.05 against the euro. Scotiabank\u2019s head of European fixed income strategy Alan Clarke\u2019s verdict is: Brexit clearly hasn\u2019t hurt business sentiment, the acid test is whether this feeds into the hard data. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, has sent his commentary on the PMI survey findings: Hiring has revived alongside upturns in new orders and business confidence, but prices continue to rise sharply. All of which adds weight to the argument that the next move by the Bank of England is as likely to be a rate hike as a cut. He said sterling weakness continued to be seen as a key driver of growth, but mainly for manufacturers. However, while manufacturers again reported stronger export sales in December, buoyed by the more competitive exchange rate, there were few signs of the weak pound boosting spend from overseas tourists in the service sector. Service sector expansion was driven by business service providers and financial services, with transport and communications and IT also showing robust growth. Activity in the hotels and restaurant sector fell for a second month running. What happened to the mini-tourism boom? The FTSE 100 index hit a new record peak of 7,211.96 earlier this morning, and is now trading just below the 7,200 mark at 7,197, up 0.1%. And here\u2019s some instant reaction from economists. They tend to be cautious, saying that the stronger-than-expected economic momentum isn\u2019t likely to last. Scott Bowman of Capital Economics says: December\u2019s Markit/CIPS report on services suggests that the UK economy will turn in another strong performance in Q4 and hasn\u2019t lost any momentum since the vote to leave the EU. The support provided to activity from a lower pound and rock-bottom interest rates should prevent growth from slowing too sharply. Overall, our forecast is for GDP growth to ease from around 2.0% in 2016 to about 1.5% in 2017. Dean Turner at UBS Wealth Management echoed those comments. The robust nature of recent economic data has been supported by a number of factors, in particular the weaker pound, as well as looser monetary and fiscal policy. As we move further into the year, our expectation is that these positive effects may begin to fade. Moreover, higher inflation is likely to erode household income growth which could dampen the up to now buoyant consumer. Here is some instant Twitter reaction. The survey findings took economists by surprise (again). They had pencilled in a slight easing in services growth in December. Let\u2019s dig deeper into those numbers. The final batch of UK PMI survey data for 2016 from IHS Markit and CIPS suggested that the service sector expanded strongly in December to the fastest rate since July 2015, fuelled by stronger growth in new work. The index remained above 50 for the fifth consecutive month, indicating a continued recovery from the contraction suffered in July linked to the EU referendum. However inflationary pressures are also picking up with prices charged by firms surging at the fastest pace since April 2011, due to the decline in sterling since the Brexit vote. The UK services PMI hit a 17-month high of 56.2 in December, up from 55.2 in November, according to Markit/CIPS, which compile the survey. The all-sector PMI, which pools the services, manufacturing and construction survey findings, is also at a 17-month high, rising to 56.4 from 55.1 in November. Markit said this points to GDP growth of 0.5% in the fourth quarter, down a tick from 0.6% in the third quarter. Falling prices for luxury pads and mansions in London triggered more deals in the autumn, says upmarket estate agent Savills. Its latest figures for prime central London show prices fell 2.1% between October and December, and by 6.9% over the year as a whole. Prices are down 12.5% since their 2014 peak. Higher property taxes coupled with political and economic uncertainty have been dragging down prices. Savills is forecasting zero growth over the next couple of years. In outer prime London, where the average value is just below \u00a32m, prices fell 4% last year and are just 2.7% down from where they were two years ago. Savills collected data that suggests from January to the end of November there were around 320 sales worth over \u00a35m in London, with a total of over \u00a33.7bn spent. The number of sales was 17% below the same 11 month period of 2015. Contrary to some reports, the very top end of the market has been more active than in 2015. In the 11 months to the end of November \u00a31.43bn was spent on properties worth over \u00a320m compared to \u00a31.07bn in 2015. Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, said: We saw a real dearth of transactions over the late spring and summer months following the race to beat the new 3% surcharge [stamp duty]. But further price adjustments, coupled with the currency play for international buyers, appear to have triggered greater buyer commitment and prime London sales volumes picked up significantly in September, October and November before easing back in December. But he cautioned: Buyer sentiment remains fragile. Improved transaction levels are the result of adjusted pricing and should not be seen as a precursor to price rises in the foreseeable future. High stamp duty rates and the uncertainty created by negotiations to leave Europe will still need to be factored into expectations on value. The forecast is for prime central London growth to total 21% in the five years to the end of 2021. Meanwhile the British car industry is warning of a sales downturn this year as the economic uncertainty that followed the Brexit vote kicks in. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes: A fifth consecutive year of growth saw nearly 2.7m new car registrations in the UK last year, a rise of 2.2% on 2015. But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it expected growth to reverse, with a sales decline of 5-6%, as the cost of new cars rises due to sterling\u2019s fall. An end to cheap financing deals would also hit sales, it said. As a reader has helpfully pointed out, global debt levels surged to more than 325% of the world\u2019s GDP last year \u2013 mainly because of a sharp increase in government debt, according to a report from the Institute for International Finance. Reuters has the details: The IIF\u2019s report found that global debt had risen more than $11 trillion in the first nine months of 2016 to more than $217 trillion. The report also found that general government debt accounted for nearly half of the total increase. Emerging market debt rose substantially, as government bond and syndicated loan issuance in 2016 grew to almost three times its 2015 level. China accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the new debt, providing $710 million of the total $855 billion in new issuance during the year, the IIF reported. Higher borrowing costs in the wake of the US presidential election and other stresses, including \u201can environment of subdued growth and still-weak corporate profitability, a stronger [US dollar], rising sovereign bond yields, higher hedging costs, and deterioration in corporate creditworthiness\u201d presented challenges for borrowers, the IIF said in its report. There\u2019s not much corporate news here in London so far, apart from a Persimmon trading update. One of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, it shrugged off Bexit uncertainty and posted 8% growth in revenues to \u00a33.2bn for 2016, when it built 15,171 homes. The York-based company said reservations for new homes remained healthy during the autumn, echoing comments made by other housebuilders. At 11am the embattled retailer Sports Direct will kick off a shareholder meeting at its Shirebrook HQ. Its chairman, Keith Hellawell, a former chief constable, is under growing pressure to step down. He already lost a vote of independent shareholders in September but his offer to resign was rejected by the board. Will he survive today\u2019s meeting? A series of City investment groups, including Aberdeen Asset Management, have called on shareholders to oppose his re-election to the retailer\u2019s board. But this time round the company\u2019s billionaire founder Mike Ashley, who owns 55% of the business, is allowed to vote, which means Hellawell could well cling on. The US Federal Reserve is cautious over the pace of interest rate hikes this year, amid a great deal of uncertainty over how much fiscal policy loosening the Trump administration will unleash, i.e. tax cuts. Last night the minutes of the American central bank\u2019s 14 December meeting which concluded with a 25 basis point rate hike, the first in a year, and only the second since the 2008 financial crisis. The minutes showed that only half of Fed officials included some form of fiscal policy loosening into their economic projections. The median projection at that meeting suggested three more 25bp rate hikes this year, which could take the fed funds target range to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of 2017. However some economists think there could be more \u2013 Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says: Assuming that the incoming Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress do agree on a major package of tax cuts by mid-year, however, we still think there will be four rate hikes this year, albeit with three of those hikes coming in the second half of 2017. The recurring theme in the minutes is the uncertainty over the direction of fiscal policy that Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected election victory has thrown up. Neverthless, almost all participants \u201cindicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies.\u201d Some participants thought the upside risks to inflation had increased too. The dollar\u2019s subsequent rally will help to keep a lid on inflation next year, but all that will do is partly offset the impact of the rally in crude oil prices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This morning at 9:30am we\u2019ll get the UK services purchasing managers\u2019 index from Markit/CIPS for December, a closely watched survey. It is expected to show a slight easing in activity, to 54.8 from 55.2. Anything above the 50 mark indicates expansion. The sister surveys for manufacturing and construction showed both sectors growing at a robust clip, suggesting the economy was stronger than many expected in the fourth quarter, despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. The Irish services PMI is already out. It indicates growth in Ireland\u2019s services sector rebounded in December, returning close to the level where it was before Britain voted to leave the European Union. Ireland is considered to be most at risk from the Brexit vote because of its close trading links with the UK. The Investec services PMI for Ireland rose to a five-month high of 59.1 in December from 56 in November, adding to a strong manufacturing survey earlier in the week which showed factory activity at a 17-month high. In the US, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s December non-farm payrolls report we get the latest ADP employment report which is expected to show a drop from November\u2019s 216,000 to about 175,000, while the latest ISM services sector survey is forecast to show a slight slowdown to 56.8, from 57.2 in November. Back in the UK, Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking at an Institute for Government event on \u2018An economy that works for everyone\u2019 at 1pm today. Britain\u2019s leading share index notched up another record close yesterday when the FTSE 100 gained 0.17% to end the day at 7,7189.74\u2013 the fifth trading day in a row it closed at an all-time high. But today could be different \u2013 European stock markets are set for a somewhat lacklustre opening. Michael Hewson, chief market economist at CMC Markets UK, is predicting: FTSE100 is expected to open unchanged at 7,189 DAX is expected to open 4 points higher at 11,588 CAC40 is expected to open unchanged at 4,899",

The last jobs report of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been published and the figures encapsulate his eight-year presidency. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/06/us-wage-growth-trump-labour-market-barack-obama-job-creation\">Job creation in December was not bad at 156,000, simply a bit mediocre</a>. Better was expected.</p> <p>In Obama\u2019s defence, he was left the worse possible legacy. The world\u2019s biggest economy was in freefall when he arrived in the White House in early 2009. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers </a>had gone bust six weeks before the November 2008 presidential election and the Federal Reserve had taken emergency action to stimulate growth as fears grew that the clock was about to be turned back to the 1930s.</p> <p>The full Grapes of Wrath nightmare was avoided, but the economy lost jobs in every month of 2009 and didn\u2019t start to recover until February 2010. Since then, jobs have been created every month...</p> <p>So how does Obama\u2019s record stack up? The answer is that it depends on what is measured and what it is measured against.</p> <p>By the standards of his predecessors in the White House during the seven decades since the end of the second world war, Obama\u2019s record is distinctly modest. The number of employed people increased on average by around 1% a year over his two terms. Only three presidents since 1945 \u2013 the two George Bushes and Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 have a worse record...</p> <p>If the comparison is with other developed countries, the US does better, at least in terms of job creation and unemployment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> arrives in the White House with the jobless rate at 4.7%, less than half that of the eurozone, and reasonably close to what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Larry\u2019s full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/06/obamas-labour-market-report-card-not-bad-could-have-done-better\">Obama's labour market report card: not bad, could have done better</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586fb60ae4b0be03bff4352f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-06T15:24:57.829Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So far the US jobs numbers have failed to put much of a spark in markets, albeit the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory and the FTSE 100 has edged higher and could well see another record close. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly bad jobs report... It just wasn\u2019t good enough to secure a market-wide rise, the dollar instead being the only major beneficiary, rising 0.8% against the Japanese yen, 0.7% against the pound and 0.3% against the euro. This helped suppress investors\u2019 appetite for the Dow Jones, which merely sat flat at 19900 after the bell.</p> <p> The weakened pound (it also dropped 0.5% against the euro) caused the FTSE to ease over the 7200 line... though it wasn\u2019t enough for the index to match the intraday peak struck during Thursday\u2019s trading. The eurozone, meanwhile, was a dead-zone, with the DAX and CAC barely managing a 0.1% rise between them.</p> <p>So that\u2019s almost it for the first week of 2017. Bar that initially 7200-grazing flurry for the FTSE it\u2019s been a painfully dull week, with investors seemingly reluctant to get on board with the all-time high-flirting indices, but content enough to let those same indices loiter just below a series of landmark levels. Though next week is even blander data-wise, a string of post-Christmas statements from the FTSE\u2019s key supermarkets and retailers, and a dose of financial earnings from the US on Friday, could cause a bit more excitement. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586fb4b8e4b0be03bff43527\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katieallen\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-06T15:17:23.845Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our story on the US jobs market, from Katie Allen:</p> <blockquote> <p>The US economy added more than 2m jobs in 2016 and finished the year with a pick-up in wages, suggesting Donald Trump will inherit a solid labour market from outgoing president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>The news of the strongest wage growth since 2009 also raised expectations that the president-elect\u2019s first year in office will be accompanied by a series of interest rate rises from the US central bank.</p> <p>In the final set of <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">jobs figures</a> for the Obama administration, December\u2019s job creation missed economists forecasts, with 156,000 new jobs added rather than the expected 178,000.

Along with rising headline inflation the Fed is probably looking back to its 3-hike 2017 dot-diagram, and thinking \u201dtold you so!\u201d </p> <p>We still think there may only be 2 hikes in 2017, but believe there is a very strong case for a March hike now, and are forecasting just that. Were we to see only 2 hikes in 2017, it is most likely to be because the Fed switches its attention later in the year to balance sheet adjustment, rather than rate hikes.</p> <p>The rest of the report was somewhat mixed. Payrolls rose 156,000, lower than the consensus 175,00 (INGf 150,000). But this is still enough to more than absorb the growth in the labour force, so no grounds for real disappointment. And the unemployment rate ticked back up from 4.6% to 4.7% (ING forecast 4.8%), which is just noise caused by labour participation volatility. </p> <p>In short, this report underlines that the US labour market is tight, and getting tighter. The Fed will not want to hang about before tightening again. This is the message we believe Janet Yellen will try to get across in her speech next Friday.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bade925dddd7892a29491d33d10c73cb1c22bdf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bade925dddd7892a29491d33d10c73cb1c22bdf3/45_0_1299_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US jobs data\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US jobs data</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-586fada2e4b0de5081fa2ed8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-06T14:49:51.422Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After raising US interest rates in December, the Federal Reserve predicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008\">there could be three further rises in 2017. </a> But after the jobs data, they may not come immediately, reckons Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest payrolls report is in line with other evidence that the US economy continues to expand at a reasonable healthy rate.

But so far the 20,000 barrier for the Dow has proved elusive, with the index coming within a whisker at 19,999.63. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has also hit a new record, with the strength of the US currency lifting dollar earners. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Now this is getting too much: the Dow has hit 19,999.63 before dipping again. Less than a point below 20,000, and another new peak. The Dow has come within less than 2 points of the elusive 20,000 barrier, but has slipped back: Heads up, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now hit a new peak and is just 7 points shy of 20,000. In Europe, the mood in the markets has stayed a little more subdued. Germany\u2019s Dax ended 0.12% higher at 11,599.01, France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.19% at 4909.84 and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.23% higher at 19,687.71. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The bulls are out in force and there\u2019s no stopping the FTSE in 2017. The blue index closed the week with yet another record high, finally closing above 7,200 after another strong session. It\u2019s the seventh straight record close and means the index has risen for five consecutive weeks \u2013 the best performance since the Brexit vote in June. We\u2019ve also got US equities jumping with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 hitting fresh intra-day record highs. And after a pretty soggy start to the US session the Dow Jones has also rallied and is now just 40 or so points away from the 20,000 mark. The session could yet see the 20k barrier finally broken. The great rotation from bonds into stocks \u2013 the Trump trade \u2013 is back on. And the FTSE 100 is not the only record breaker, nor is all the attention in the US market on whether the Dow will breach 20,000: A burst of life on Wall Street following further consideration of the US jobs data has helped push the FTSE 100 to a record close for the seventh day in a row. Another closing high on Monday would see the index match the eight day record winning streak seen in 1997. After an uncertain start, the index finished 14.74 points or 0.2% higher at 7210.05 - the first time it has closed above 7200. This is the fifth consecutive weekly rise - the best performance since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last year. The rise in the US currency on talk of further rate rises after the non-farm numbers has given a lift to the dollar earners in the FTSE 100, with Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems both among the leading risers. After a negative start, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 49 points at 19948 - back on its way towards 20,000. And here is our economics editor Larry Elliott on Barack Obama\u2019s final jobs data: So that\u2019s it. The last jobs report of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been published and the figures encapsulate his eight-year presidency. Job creation in December was not bad at 156,000, simply a bit mediocre. Better was expected. In Obama\u2019s defence, he was left the worse possible legacy. The world\u2019s biggest economy was in freefall when he arrived in the White House in early 2009. Lehman Brothers had gone bust six weeks before the November 2008 presidential election and the Federal Reserve had taken emergency action to stimulate growth as fears grew that the clock was about to be turned back to the 1930s. The full Grapes of Wrath nightmare was avoided, but the economy lost jobs in every month of 2009 and didn\u2019t start to recover until February 2010. Since then, jobs have been created every month... So how does Obama\u2019s record stack up? The answer is that it depends on what is measured and what it is measured against. By the standards of his predecessors in the White House during the seven decades since the end of the second world war, Obama\u2019s record is distinctly modest. The number of employed people increased on average by around 1% a year over his two terms. Only three presidents since 1945 \u2013 the two George Bushes and Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 have a worse record... If the comparison is with other developed countries, the US does better, at least in terms of job creation and unemployment. Donald Trump arrives in the White House with the jobless rate at 4.7%, less than half that of the eurozone, and reasonably close to what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: So far the US jobs numbers have failed to put much of a spark in markets, albeit the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory and the FTSE 100 has edged higher and could well see another record close. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It wasn\u2019t a particularly bad jobs report... It just wasn\u2019t good enough to secure a market-wide rise, the dollar instead being the only major beneficiary, rising 0.8% against the Japanese yen, 0.7% against the pound and 0.3% against the euro. This helped suppress investors\u2019 appetite for the Dow Jones, which merely sat flat at 19900 after the bell. The weakened pound (it also dropped 0.5% against the euro) caused the FTSE to ease over the 7200 line... though it wasn\u2019t enough for the index to match the intraday peak struck during Thursday\u2019s trading. The eurozone, meanwhile, was a dead-zone, with the DAX and CAC barely managing a 0.1% rise between them. So that\u2019s almost it for the first week of 2017. Bar that initially 7200-grazing flurry for the FTSE it\u2019s been a painfully dull week, with investors seemingly reluctant to get on board with the all-time high-flirting indices, but content enough to let those same indices loiter just below a series of landmark levels. Though next week is even blander data-wise, a string of post-Christmas statements from the FTSE\u2019s key supermarkets and retailers, and a dose of financial earnings from the US on Friday, could cause a bit more excitement. Here\u2019s our story on the US jobs market, from Katie Allen: The US economy added more than 2m jobs in 2016 and finished the year with a pick-up in wages, suggesting Donald Trump will inherit a solid labour market from outgoing president Barack Obama. The news of the strongest wage growth since 2009 also raised expectations that the president-elect\u2019s first year in office will be accompanied by a series of interest rate rises from the US central bank. In the final set of jobs figures for the Obama administration, December\u2019s job creation missed economists forecasts, with 156,000 new jobs added rather than the expected 178,000. But earlier months\u2019 figures were revised to show 19,000 more jobs were created than previously thought and pay growth was stronger than expected. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics commented: \u201cThe more modest 156,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in December suggests that labour market conditions weakened just a fraction in the closing stages of last year. Nevertheless, that is still a solid gain, particularly as it followed an even bigger 204,000 increase in November.\u201d The figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a total of 2.2m jobs were added to the world\u2019s biggest economy in 2016 after the creation of 2.7m in 2015. The full story is here: More US data, and a slightly disappointing set of factory goods orders. New orders fell 2.4% in November after a drop in the volatile civilian aircraft numbers. Analysts had been expecting a decline of 2.2% although October\u2019s figure was revised upwards from a gain of 2.7% to 2.8%. And the underlying trend suggested that manufacturing is holding up. Excluding aircraft, orders rose 0.9% in November, the same as the previous month. However Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, believes a rate rise could be more imminent: The December Labour market report shows why it is wrong to write off a March hike from the Fed. The key figure here is average hourly earnings \u2013 now rising at 2.9% year on year, its highest rate of growth since June 2009. Along with rising headline inflation the Fed is probably looking back to its 3-hike 2017 dot-diagram, and thinking \u201dtold you so!\u201d We still think there may only be 2 hikes in 2017, but believe there is a very strong case for a March hike now, and are forecasting just that. Were we to see only 2 hikes in 2017, it is most likely to be because the Fed switches its attention later in the year to balance sheet adjustment, rather than rate hikes. The rest of the report was somewhat mixed. Payrolls rose 156,000, lower than the consensus 175,00 (INGf 150,000). But this is still enough to more than absorb the growth in the labour force, so no grounds for real disappointment. And the unemployment rate ticked back up from 4.6% to 4.7% (ING forecast 4.8%), which is just noise caused by labour participation volatility. In short, this report underlines that the US labour market is tight, and getting tighter. The Fed will not want to hang about before tightening again. This is the message we believe Janet Yellen will try to get across in her speech next Friday. After raising US interest rates in December, the Federal Reserve predicted there could be three further rises in 2017. But after the jobs data, they may not come immediately, reckons Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management: The latest payrolls report is in line with other evidence that the US economy continues to expand at a reasonable healthy rate. The Fed have signalled that they wish to continue with gradual interest rate rises, however given the uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any fiscal stimulus, we expect them to hold off until they have greater detail on policy changes from the new administration. This suggests they will wait until the second quarter of 2017 before raising rates again. Despite the US jobs market seeming in fairly robust shape despite a disappointing headline figure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen back in early trading. It is currently down 40 points at 19859 points, shying further away from the 20,000 barrier. But the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened slightly higher. Weak productivity has dogged the UK economy since the financial crisis and the latest update from the Office for National Statistics shows the output problem isn\u2019t going away. That\u2019s bad news for living standards, as firms struggle to raise wages in line with inflation. Not long now until the Dow Jones opens and some analysts are predicting that the index could hit the 20,000 mark for the first time ever today, after non-farm payrolls data undershot expectations but still showed a US labour market in solid shape. Here\u2019s Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: Could today\u2019s NFP [non-farm payrolls] miss send the Dow to 20k at long last? It\u2019s touch and go \u2013 US equities could receive that extra leg of support they need after the monthly US jobs report was little short of expectations, but the data doesn\u2019t really alter the broader narrative that says the Fed is on track to raise rates three times in 2017. Jobs numbers missed their mark but this slight slip up alone is certainly not enough to stop the Fed from raising rates this year. The data is a little positive, a little negative. US bond yields and the dollar index both firmed having slipped a little over the last 24 hours, while stock futures turned higher. Some more reaction to the US jobs numbers, this time from Kully Samra, managing director at the UK outpost of American brokerage Charles Schwab. Despite December\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers missing forecasts, the US economy still has a robust labour market. The case for investment in the US remains very much intact. These figures should still be viewed as a justification of the interest rate hike last month, and we continue to expect the FED to raise rates throughout the year. Today\u2019s numbers do not alter the trends we are seeing in wider economic data, which shows a definite inflection in the economy. When coupled with the simultaneous inflection in earnings, this bodes well for the stock market in 2017. We remain optimistic that this is an ongoing secular bull market in US stocks and the risk of it ending swiftly is low. Bear markets tend to sniff out economic recessions and, with growth accelerating from its below-trend pace, the risk of that is also low. Reaction to the US labour market update is proving fairly optimistic, despite non-farm payrolls coming in below expectations at 156,000. Some analysts are focusing on the improvement from November, while sentiment is also buoyed by signs of wage growth. Here\u2019s Paul Sirani chief market analyst at trading firm Xtrade:- Figures released today show the US employment rate has risen since the nine-year low in November, implying there is a solid pace of hiring despite the proposed expansionary fiscal policy stance. Average hourly earnings have rebounded after a dip in November, with nonfarm payrolls figures showing consistency despite a slight dip, indicating the economy is on a path to stronger growth. This leaves economists optimistic about 2017, giving Donald Trump\u2019s administration a stronger outset as the President-elect prepares to take over from Barack Obama. And there\u2019s this from Dennis de Jong at broker UFX:- Despite the non-farm payroll reading coming in below expectations, employment in the US has been strong for some time now. It looks as though we are coming towards the end of an eight-year bull cycle fuelled by loose monetary policy. The December interest rate rise came as no surprise and the latest minutes from the Fed suggest that more interventions will be required in 2017 to keep growth steady. Although there is still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the President-elect\u2019s Trumponomics, the markets have reacted positively to his economic stimulus programme. The dollar looks likely to continue on its positive trajectory and there\u2019s a very real chance that it will hit parity with the euro at some point this year.\u201d MPs are calling for higher penalties on firms that fail to pay the minimum wage, after nearly 700 companies were fined \u00a31.4m for underpaying staff. The culprits include football clubs and restaurants. If you\u2019re wondering how the FTSE100 has reacted to those slightly disappointing US non-farm payroll figures, you needn\u2019t bother. It hasn\u2019t done much of anything at all. The blue-chip index remains flatter than a Dutch dairy farm, up less than a point at 7196.23. Any rise at all will be the seventh consecutive all-time high. The record is eight in a row, set in May 1997. The keenly-awaited US jobs release, known as non-farm payrolls, has landed. The US economy created a worse-than-expected 156,000 jobs in December, some distance below the consensus forecast of 178,000. On the plus side, October and November\u2019s numbers were revised up to show 19,000 more jobs added than was previously reported. Overall, the US economy created 2.16m jobs in 2016. The unemployment rate in December was 4.7%, up from 4.6% and bang on the consensus forecast. Average hourly earnings increased by 10 cents, or 0.4%, offering some hope of momentum in the labour market and stronger economic growth. We are just minutes away from learning how many jobs the US economy created in December, with the release of monthly non-farm payroll data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This will be the last jobs update of the Obama presidency. Market consensus is for 178,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.7%. Anything wildly different from that is likely to trigger major stock market movements. For a reminder of how the US economy looked when Obama took over in 2008 versus how it looks today, check out this post from earlier. Last year was a bad one for mergers and acquisitions, according to corporate intelligence firm Bureau van Dijk, which has issued a report drawing on data from deals database Zephyr. The total global value (including debt) of takeovers slumped 21% from $6tn in 2015 to $4.7tn, while the number of deals declined 10% to 96,665. This was despite mammoth deals such as the $124bn \u201cMegabrew\u201d takeover of SABMiller by fellow drinks giant AB In-Bev. Although dealmaking was on the wane, Zephyr pointed out that 2016 was actually ahead of every year since 2007, barring 2014 and 2015, which was a record. Zephyr director Lisa Wright said: After an extremely impressive year in 2015 it was always going to be difficult for 2016 deal activity to keep up such a blistering pace. Geopolitical factors such as the UK referendum on Europe and the US election brought economic concerns, both before and after their eventual outcomes. Based on the results from the last 12 months, it is clear that 2015\u2019s momentum has not gathered even more pace, but it is worth noting that 2016\u2019s value is not far behind 2014 and is still significantly higher than any yearly value generated between 2008 and 2013. [...] It could be that dealmakers have simply been more cautious after spending so freely in 2015, which has led to the decline in volume which held down activity in 2016. Here\u2019s a prediction from City firm IG Index on how US stock markets will open, as we await the last monthly update on US jobs of the Obama administration. Predictably, given that we don\u2019t know the outcome yet, it\u2019s flat as your hat. After Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane issued a mea culpa on behalf of his profession, the Guardian business desk\u2019s economic minds have been musing on what much-maligned experts can do to win back public trust. They\u2019ve come up with a list of five ways that economists can repair their battered reputations. Just Racing Services Limited (JRSL), the operating company of Formula 1\u2019s smallest and least successful team Manor, has gone into administration. \u201cDuring recent months, the senior management has worked tirelessly to bring new investment to the team to secure its long-term future, but regrettably has been unable to do so within the time available,\u201d said joint administrator Geoff Rowley, of FRP Advisory. \u201cTherefore they have been left with no alternative but to place JRSL into administration\u201d. Manor is owned by Stephen Fitzpatrick, who is also the founder and chief executive of small energy supplier OVO Energy. Here\u2019s a round-up of what the major banks are predicting for today\u2019s update on how many jobs the US economy created in December. The consensus forecast is 178,000. Anything above that could send the FTSE100 to a new all-time high and might also push the Dow Jones above 20,000, a watermark it has been flirting with for weeks. Labour productivity data from the Office for National Statistics can be hard to unpick but Mariano Mamertino, EMEA economist at jobs website Indeed.co.uk, is having a go. He\u2019s concerned that low output signals trouble ahead. Britain\u2019s stubbornly low wage growth had given early clues that productivity was likely to struggle, and the post-referendum uncertainty was never going to help. While the full impact of the Brexit vote has yet to be felt, the UK labour market remains in far better health than most economists would have predicted even a few months ago. But such disappointing levels of productivity growth bely the economy\u2019s apparent robustness and pose a serious threat to wage growth prospects. Productivity is the ultimate driver of both wages and living standards - so with with inflation set to creep up steadily this year, increasing numbers of workers now risk seeing their wages fall in real terms. With economists warning of \u2018a decade of lost wage growth\u2019 the prospect of Britons seeing both their earning and buying power shrink is a chilling one. The UK\u2019s productivity continues to lag far behind that of other major economies. But hurt national pride aside, this is above all a clear indication that despite the short-term resilience, warning signs are on the horizon.\u201d Do we detect a note of scepticism out there at the suggestion that Brexit is to blame for Jamie Oliver shutting six of his restaurants? I think we do. This is what Duncan Weldon, the head of research at investment firm Resolution Group, had to say about it. The managing director of Belfast Airport is warning that a 12.5% corporation tax rate, designed to woo US business, won\u2019t do much good without a transatlantic route in and out of Belfast. Our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald writes:- Northern Ireland won\u2019t fully exploit a lower regional corporation tax unless a transatlantic air link is restored, the head of the province\u2019s main airport has warned. Despite United Airlines pulling out of Belfast International Airport thus ending Northern Ireland\u2019s only air route to North America, passenger numbers were still up in 2016. Results today show record growth last year in passengers passing through Belfast International with double-digit growth in traffic from July. But Keddie warned that unless a new North American route opens up, the impact of a lower regional corporation tax of around 12.5% (aimed at wooing American direct investment just like the Irish Republic does) would be blunted. Keddie said: \u201cAs a region, Northern Ireland has to have direct access to the USA which will underpin the inward investment drive. We have the prospect of reduced corporation tax to look forward to next year but its impact could be blunted if we don\u2019t have direct, point-to-point access for potential inward investors to Northern Ireland. The value of digital currency Bitcoin is tumbling again, after it slumped in value by 20% yesterday. One Bitcoin is worth $918.57 at the moment, down a further 8.7%. The slump follows a steady rise in the currency\u2019s value that saw it reach $1000 at the beginning of the year. You can chart the rise and fall of Bitcoin more closely here. Bitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and is free of control from any central bank or government, making it attractive to those who want to get around capital controls. Critics say this has made it a haven for nefarious types to trade in illicit goods and services. British labour costs rose at their fastest annual rate since late 2013 in the three months after the UK voted to leave the European Union, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Growth in unit labour costs, which the Bank of England watches as a key driver of inflation, moved up to 2.3% year-on-year in the third quarter, the steepest increase since the final quarter of 2013. Productivity remains weak though, with annual growth in output per hour just 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly up on 0.2% in the second. Anyone planning to fly with British Airways on January 10 or 11 will still be able to do so, the airline says, despite planned strikes by some of its cabin crew. Crew serving as BA \u201cmixed fleet\u201d, a segment of the workforce whose pay and conditions are not as good as those enjoyed by some long-serving staff, are planning a 48-hour strike after rejecting a pay offer from the airline. BA said most flights would operate as normal on the two strike days, with some departure time changes affecting flights out of Heathrow. After the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane issued a chastening assessment of economists\u2019 forecasting powers, our economics reporter Katie Allen has some recommended reading for you. Here\u2019s historian and columnist Timothy Garton-Ash on how economics is not a hard science. TV chef and professed healthy eating enthusiast Jamie Oliver is to close six of his restaurants, at a cost of 120 jobs. The group\u2019s chief executive Simon Blagden says post-Brexit \u201cpressures and unknowns\u201d are partly to blame. Here\u2019s the full story. At 1.30pm we\u2019ll get the latest update on US employment with the release of non-farm payroll data for December. Let\u2019s have a look at how things stand in the last month of President Obama\u2019s tenure, compared to how they looked when he took over. Forecast for non-farm payrolls in December 2016: Up 178,000 Non-farm payrolls in December 2008: Down 705,000 Unemployment forecast for December 2016: 4.7% Unemployment in December 2008: 7.2% Dow Jones in January 2016: Flirting with 20,000 mark Dow Jones in January 2009: Record inauguration day low of 7949 US GDP in third quarter 2016: Up 3.5% US GDP in third quarter 2008: Down 0.3% A few other things have changed too. On President Obama\u2019s inauguration day in 2009, Lady Gaga was a Number 1 in the UK with Poker Face. More importantly, President-elect Donald Trump was yet to tweet for the first time, with the social media service still in its infancy. How time flies. Will the FTSE100 hit another record high today? The folks at financial spread-betting firm Spreadex think it might turn out to be a damp squib. Here\u2019s their financial analyst Connor Campbell. Unlike the Next drama or Persimmon boost seen earlier this week there was no major earnings news this Friday to drive trading, leaving the FTSE to flounder around 7180. The index couldn\u2019t even take any solace from the pound\u2019s slight weakening, with sterling dropping 0.2% against both the euro and the dollar. Following the steady stream of PMIs since Tuesday the UK\u2019s empty economic calendar suggests it might be hard for the FTSE to find any upwards momentum as the day goes on. Or, at the very least, it may have to wait until the final Obama-era non-farm jobs report from the US this afternoon for something a bit more interesting. It may have lost out to Heathrow in the fierce battle to be chosen for expansion, but Gatwick Airport is in decent shape. It welcomed a record 43m passengers through its doors during 2016, with long haul traffic up nearly 27% and cargo 13.3% higher in tonnage terms. Gatwick credits Prince Harry with a 97% rise in passengers heading to Toronto, where he has visiting girlfriend Meghan Markle. There has also been a sharp rise in flights to Belfast, which Gatwick is putting down to a Game of Thrones effect. Much of the hit dragon-based TV show is filmed in Northern Ireland. The FTSE100 has started the day marginally down, putting a spanner in the works of its bid to match the all-time record for consecutive record highs. It will have to rise both today and Monday to measure up to the longest winning streak ever recorded, in May 1997. The blue-chip index closed yesterday at 7195.31 and has started the day down about 9 points. Stronger-than-expected US jobs data later today could help push it back above the waterline. South Korean electronics firm Samsung expects to report a 50% rise in profits in the fourth-quarter, despite the disastrous saga of its now infamous Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. The handset displayed a worrying tendency to explode before it was finally pulled from production altogether. While Samsung\u2019s smartphones tend to get all the attention, it was the firm\u2019s semiconductor and display businesses that did the heavy lifting in the last four months of the year. There hasn\u2019t been too much news coming out of the City of London so far this year but easyJet has woken up on this frosty Friday with a smile on its big orange face. December proved a bumper month for the no-frills airline, with passenger numbers up 15% on last year to nearly 5.6m. Load factor, the extent to which it filled its planes, was also higher at 89.9%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has been looking ahead to those eagerly-awaited US jobs numbers. He\u2019s not overly optimistic, in the light of a separate set of employment numbers released yesterday by the ADP Research Institute. Their figures suggest just 153,000 new jobs were added in December, down sharply from 215,000 in November. For the last two years the November and December jobs numbers have been pretty strong numbers due largely to large amounts of temporary hiring that takes place in the lead up to Thanksgiving and Christmas. In 2016 this jobs growth hasn\u2019t been on anywhere the same scale with ADP for December showing half the additional jobs from twelve months ago while the November BLS numbers were also underwhelming, which might suggest that today\u2019s number could disappoint. Expectations are for a number in the region of 180k, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise if we came in below that. Let\u2019s have a look at how traders are expecting Europe\u2019s stock markets to open today. According to City trading firm IG Index, it\u2019s going to be flatter than a pancake out there. US jobs data later in the day might change all of that, of course. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With a fortnight to go until President Obama leaves office, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the final monthly jobs data (known as non-farm payrolls) of his eight-year administration. The US economy is forecast to have created 175,000 jobs in December. Unemployment is expected to be up slightly from 4.6% to 4.7%. Over in the City of London, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has until 5pm today to lodge a formal bid for the 61% of BSkyB it does not own. Sky and Fox have already reached preliminary agreement on an \u00a311.2bn deal, five years after Murdoch was forced to abandon a similar deal amid public disgust at the role of his media empire in the phone-hacking scandal. The FTSE100 has closed at an all-time high for six days in a row, the longest streak of records since 1997. The blue-chip index will need to repeat the trick both today and Monday to match the eight-day record set 19 years ago.",

                "bodyText":"While the FTSE 100 was breaking new records, European markets were more subdued but still managed to end the day in positive territory, for the most part. The final scores showed: Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.17% to 11,583.30 France\u2019s Cac closed up just 0.01% at 4888.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.33% to 19,424.19 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9452.0 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 42 points or 0.2% at 19,929, heading back towards the 20,000 barrier. Meanwhile after its recent falls, the pound is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2160 and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1511. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high for the ninth day running, breaking a record which has stood for nearly 20 years. The index finished up 0.53% at a new peak of 7275.47, bettering the eight day winning streak recorded in May 1997 as Tony Blair\u2019s Labour won the general election. The FTSE 250 has closed at 18,413, also a record high. As markets continue to climb - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in positive territory and just under 60 points away from the 20,000 level - Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE 100 has again had an outstanding day, with the index gaining from the first minute to the last as it reached new all-time highs once more. The fact that we are seeing the index hit these new highs in such a fearless manner says a lot about the potential for further gains. Interestingly we have seen both [President elect] Trump and [UK prime minister} May providing positive news for the respective US and UK indices, yet for very different reasons. While Trump has boosted US stocks by setting out a positive outlook for the future, the strength of the FTSE has been largely down to the pound devaluation associated with fears over a hard Brexit outcome. Back with the markets, and the FTSE 100 is well on course to break two records - a new closing peak and the longest run of closing highs. With a winning streak of nine consecutive end-of-day peaks, this would beat the previous record set in May 1997. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the pound still at 2 month to 10 week lows (even if it did manage to shrink much of today\u2019s losses), the miners boosted by data from China [factory gate inflation] and the supermarkets led higher by Morrisons impressive Christmas performance the FTSE has plenty of support this Tuesday..[This] sees the index set to break the record for most consecutive days of new all-time closing highs, a record that has lasted for just shy of 20 years. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is giving a speech on Brexit and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering it in the politics live blog: As investors await the US reporting season to see if company results justify the heady heights the stock market has reached, leading shares have edged lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came perilously close to the elusive 20,000 barrier on Friday, has shied further away from that level. It is currently down 27 points or 0.13% at 19,860. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both slipped marginally at the open. Back in the markets, the pound has pulled out of today\u2019s slide and is now flat against the US dollar at $1.217. It\u2019s still down slightly against the euro though, at \u20ac1.149. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the recovery could be temporary... Monday was a bit like Deja-Vu for currency traders, and a keen reminder of how politics can play havoc with a currency. Sterling declined to its lowest level since October as political fears and the Brexit premium started to bite. The pound has managed to claw back some losses on Tuesday, but it remains at risk from a further decline in sentiment. This year\u2019s Davos will certainly be different, thanks to the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Attendees will be pondering whether populist forces will triumph in elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands this year, and president Trump\u2019s views on climate change, financial regulation and global inequality. So it\u2019s no surprise that Klaus Schwab, who created WEF decades ago, is no fan of populism. But, of course, those \u2018populist\u2019 forces are no fans of Davos either! CNBC\u2019s Matt Clinch has a good take: In a nod to this current mood, this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (WEF) is titled \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership\u201d and its official agenda describes a \u201cweakening of multiple systems\u201d that has eroded confidence and speaks of a possible \u201cdownward spiral\u201d fuelled by protectionism, populism and nativism. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as U.S. president on January 20 will overshadow the event but it\u2019s hard to see how every conference, bilateral meeting or roundtable in Davos won\u2019t include some reference to this political upheaval, which the conservative news aggregation site The Drudge Report calls the \u201cnew, new world order\u201d. Indeed, some critics have attacked the event itself as being a reason why U.S. citizens started to question globalization and contemplate the negative impacts it\u2019s had on some parts of Western nations. CNBC: The \u2018party of Davos\u2019 wakes up to the new, new world order Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Campbell and Albertina Torsoli agree that China will be one of the big issues at WEF next week. They explain: The most high-profile guest by far will be Chinese president Xi Jinping, the first sitting Chinese leader to attend the event. He\u2019s heading a larger-than-ever delegation of business executives from the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, underscoring China\u2019s determination to assume a global leadership role as other major powers are hobbled by domestic infighting. China\u2019s two richest citizens, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda Group Co. Ltd CEO Wang Jianlin, will join him and appear in solo on-stage interviews. China\u2019s deepening engagement with the world will, meanwhile, be the subject of a discussion on \u201cChina\u2019s Role for Global Prosperity,\u201d in which stock-market regulator Fang Xinghai and state-assets chief Xiao Yaqing will appear alongside Lloyds of London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale. More here: Chinese president Xi\u2019s first visit to Davos, next week, is an important opportunity to strengthen relations between China and the rest of the world, says argues WEF founder Klaus Schwab. Schwab tells the WEF press conference that Xi Jinping will attend with a set of top officials and businesspeople, at a time when its economic power is as important as ever. Since I first visited China in 1979, we have developed a very close relationship, close presence in China. We are all aware that we are now in transition to a multi-polar geo-political and geo-economic structure. China will equal the United States soon for economic power. And I foresee that President Xi will show how China will assume a responsive and responsible leadership role in global affairs. Schwab also reiterates that populism won\u2019t make the world a better place. We are living in a very complex world. All the issues are interrelated.... There are no simple answers to the challenges that we have. So what we have to do in Davos is show how complicated the situation is. Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum are getting ready for their 47th annual meeting, which begins next Monday. A lot has happened around the world since the 46th get-together, and much will have shocked the CEOs, government leaders and other heavy-hitters who trek to the ski resort each year. WEF founder Klaus Schwab and colleagues are holding a pre-meeting press conference now (it\u2019s online here). Schwab says this year\u2019s meeting must make progress towards tackling the world\u2019s problems - and argued that the rising tide of populism isn\u2019t the answer. Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned to fail. We cannot just have populist solutions. The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic approach....and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, united in one mission - improving the state of the world. Schwab also singled out the challenge created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (the new wave of automation and robotics), and pointed out that Chinese premier President Xi Jinping will address Davos for the first time. Over in Italy, two people have been arrested for allegedly hacking into the email accounts of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, former prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, and thousands of others. We don\u2019t know what information was obtained, or what it was used for, but it will only intensify the focus on cybersecurity. Reuters has the details: \u201cThere were tens of thousands of email accounts hacked, and among them were accounts belonging to bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals in the Vatican,\u201d Roberto Di Legami, director of the specialised cyber police unit that conducted the investigation, told Reuters. Police have sequestered a server in Rome containing thousands of files, but 99 percent of the data was stored in the United States, Di Legami said. The information will be shipped back in coming days but it will take some time before it can be analysed. While the FTSE 100 hits fresh highs, the pound is on track for its worst three-day run sin October. Sterling is now down 0.2% at $1.214, adding to Monday\u2019s 1% slide, and keeping it at a 10-week low against the US dollar. It\u2019s also at two-month lows against the euro, down 0.25% at \u20ac1.147. These aren\u2019t big moves, of course, but it does bring the pound rather close to its weakest level against the dollar since the alarming \u2018flash crash\u2019 of early October, which is $1.2080. This chart from City expert David Jones shows how the pound\u2019s rally in November has now unravelled: Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says the uncertainty around Brexit is overshadowing the fact that UK economic data has been better than expected. He writes: \u201cThe pound\u2019s lowly performance this week took a sharper hit, reaching fresh 10-week-lows, owing largely to dimming hopes for a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit. The key issue being the taut stance of EU over free-movement and its effect on the prospects of a single market access deal for the U.K. Selling pressure on the pound is expected to stay until further details are revealed in the coming weeks. On the bright side, the economy is still defying expectations as it continues to persist on the momentum from 2016 and a lower pound has positively affected exports. Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford to increase interest rates anytime in the near future \u2013 such indicators normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole driver of the current narrative.\u201d Incidentally, the FTSE 100 could also set its longest run of daily gains since 2009 today -- as well as the lengthiest stretch of record highs ever. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since it was created in 1984. After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, an new intraday high. Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the last eight days running. It\u2019s gained 8% since the start of December: So if the rally holds, the FTSE 100 will close at a record high for the ninth day running. This would smash the previous record set in 1997 after Tony Blair won a landslide general election victory. Mining companies are now leading the rally, helped by optimism about economic growth next year. The strong Christmas trading figures from Morrison\u2019s are pushing supermarkets shares higher too. Here\u2019s some more snippets from the parliamentary hearing on Brexit and the City, via Financial News\u2019s Lucy McNulty: Over in parliament, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has warned that thousands of City jobs could be lost if the uncertainty around Brexit doesn\u2019t ease. Xavier Rolet told the Treasury committee that LSE clients wouldn\u2019t wait for clarity about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the few thousands. But the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it\u2019s syndication, trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of thousands of jobs. They would then start migrating.\u201d (thanks to Ben Woods of the Press Association for the quotes). HSBC chairman Douglas Flint is also talking about clients\u2019 concerns about Brexit. We\u2019ll have more on this shortly... Food inflation is returning to the UK, and the weak pound is partly to blame. Research group Kantar Worldpanel has reported that grocery prices rose by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first time in just over two years that food prices have gone up. The cost of importing foodstuffs like sugar and chocolate into the UK has risen since sterling slumped against other currencies. And one of the country\u2019s largest food producers, Premier Foods, is now in talks to hike prices. It\u2019s bad news for fans of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia custard and Loyd Grossman\u2019s sauces. City AM reported overnight that Premier was talking to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda due to \u201cgrowing cost pressures from the weaker pound in the wake of the EU referendum\u201d. A spokeswoman has now confirmed that negotations are underway, saying: \u201cThe situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customer. On average we are considering rises around the midsingle digit mark.\u201d The swingometer has been a staple of British current affair since the 1950s. And analysts at HSBC have created their own version, the \u2018Brexometer\u2019 to show whether the City is expecting a hard or soft Brexit. Today\u2019s weakening pound suggests we\u2019re heading towards a rather solid exit (losing full access to the single market, and no longer subject to the free movement of people, capital, goods and services). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx predicts more sterling volatility today: The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn set to deliver a speech claiming the UK can be better off out of the EU meaning it might be another rough day for the pound. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a major speech on Europe today that will outline his vision for Britain after Brexit. Our political editor Anushka Asthana explains: Jeremy Corbyn will use his first speech of 2017 to claim that Britain can be better off outside the EU and insist that the Labour party has no principled objection to ending the free movement of European workers in the UK. Setting out his party\u2019s pitch on Brexit in the year that Theresa May will trigger article 50, the Labour leader will also reach for the language of leave campaigners by promising to deliver on a pledge to spend millions of pounds extra on the NHS every week. He will say Labour\u2019s priority in EU negotiations will remain full access to the European single market, but that his party wants \u201cmanaged migration\u201d and to repatriate powers from Brussels that would allow governments to intervene in struggling industries such as steel. Sources suggested that the economic demands were about tariff-free access to the single market, rather than membership that they argued did not exist. Karl Whelan, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin, tweets that this call for immigration control but full access to the single market seems familiar.... The Financial Times argues today that \u201cexasperation\u201d over Theresa May\u2019s lack of clarity about Brexit are doing the real damage to sterling. Traders aren\u2019t surprised that Britain is likely to leave the single market, to allow new controls on immigration, but they are uncomfortable in the dark waiting for more details. Here\u2019s a flavour: With less than three months to go before the government plans to invoke Article 50 and begin the Brexit process, there is nervousness that the government has yet to reveal a plan. \u201cThere is no clear path and a lack of substance,\u201d said Andrew Soper, head of FX options at Nomura. More here: Traders fret over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit vagueness The pound is continuing to drop. It just hit a new 10-week low of $1.2118 against the US dollar, down another half a cent this morning. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading. The index of the largest companies listed in London gained 23 points, or 0.3%, to hit 7261 points. That\u2019s partly due to the pound\u2019s weakness, which boosts the value of international companies and should help exporters. A strong performance by the supermarket sector is also helping, after Morrisons posted its best sales results in seven years. Morrison\u2019s share are up 4%, with rivals Sainsbury and Tesco close behind. On Monday night the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high for the 8th day in a row. That last happened in 1997 -- a ninth consecutive closing high today would break that record. Despite Theresa May\u2019s best efforts, the pound is under renewed pressure this morning as investors fret about Brexit. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% against the euro to \u20ac1.1466 in early trading, its lowest level since the 10th November. The pound is also a little weaker against the US dollar at $1.2137, adding to Monday\u2019s losses (when it hit a three-month low against the greenback). The PM claimed on Monday that Britain will get the best possible deal from the EU. However, her insistence that the UK can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of membership\u2019 have fuelled worries about a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit (not a term Mrs May approves of), and exit from the single market. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound was \u2018battered\u2019 on Monday. She predicts that investors will keep betting against sterling until they know the details of Brexit. We expect the pound to remain the most volatile of the G10 currencies in the coming months while we wait for the triggering of Article 50. Essentially the market is likely to re-establish shorts in GBP, after a brief respite at the end of last year, until it is quite confident that Brexit won\u2019t be \u2018hard\u2019 or disastrous for the UK economy. While Theresa May says that we can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of the EU\u2019, sterling isn\u2019t safe from the bears until we know what will replace the single market. Any potential recovery in the pound be scuppered by \u201cheightened levels of political risk\u201d, she adds. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re getting a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy this morning, with results from supermarket chain Wm Morrison and retailer Majestic Wine. The early signs are encouraging, with Morrison\u2019s posting its best sales growth since 2009 - up 2.9% over the crucial Christmas period. That suggests UK consumer confidence is holding up, although Morrison\u2019s new management team should take the credit too. Majestic says its retail outlets had their biggest ever Christmas too, with like-for-like sales up 7.5%. So, Britain hasn\u2019t lost its appetite for wine - and after 2016, who can blame us? More on all that shortly.... Also coming up today Three City chiefs will be grilled by MPs about Brexit this morning. Douglas Flint of HSBC, Elizabeth Corley of Allianz Global Investors and Xavier Rolet of the London Stock Exchange are due before the Treasury committee at 10am. And City traders will be watching to see Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 can maintain its run of record highs.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, the chair of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie has commented on the session with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He said: The Governor has given strong advice today, both to the UK Government and to the governments of the rest of the EU. He\u2019s told the Government that it is \u201chighly advisable\u201d to seek agreement to transitional arrangements, and at the start of the negotiations. And he\u2019s also told the UK\u2019s negotiating counterparts in the EU that they, more than the UK, are vulnerable to financial stability risks during the period of transition. I hope they are all listening. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In Europe the mood was also fairly buoyant while in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ricocheted between positive and negative and positive again as president elect Donald Trump gave his press conference. The final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.54% to 11,646.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.01% to 4888.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.32% to 19,486.88 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.46% at 9408.6 Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points at 19,874 having been as high as 19,973 and as low as 19,833 during the day so far. While Carney was speaking, the FTSE 100 ran up three new records, as continuing weakness in the pound - it hit a near 32 year low against the dollar excluding last year\u2019s flash crash- continued to drive overseas earners higher. The index smashed through the 7300 level although it later slipped back as the pound came off its worst levels, ending up 15.02 at 7290.49. That marked a new peak, the tenth day of record closes and the 12th day of rises. All three never seen before. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The Footsie has now seen a dozen days of price increases, in what amounts to its longest winning streak ever. It won\u2019t go on forever, but the winter rally has shown it has considerable legs. It\u2019s not just the miners and international companies benefiting from lower sterling which are sustaining the rally, some domestically-focussed stocks are also chipping in, which suggests some optimism towards the prospects for UK companies is driving the market upward too. In a two and a half hour session, Bank of England chair Mark Carney and members of its financial policy committee were quizzed on Brexit, forecasting and stress tests. Carney said Brexit was no longer the most significant domestic risk to financial stablity. But he maintained that the Bank\u2019s actions had mitigated the risks around the referendum vote. On the Brexit discussions, Carney said the consequences of not having a transitional deal would be higher for the EU than for the UK. On the subject of the Bank getting its forecasts wrong ahead of the vote, FPC member Martin Taylor said that just because there had not been a problem yet, that meant there would not be problems. Carney says forecasting has improved because they look at what could go wrong rather than thinking everything was going right. He repeats that the Bank\u2019s actions and preparations helped mitigate some of the risks following the vote. Martin Taylor said he was surprised at the strength of the economy since the Brexit vote, but it was because forecasters overestimated the negative effect of the referendum on consumer confidence. Speaking of forecasts, Carney suggested the Bank was likely to lift its UK growth forecasts in February. Anil Kashyap of the FPC reckons the risk to financial stability has not yet increased because of the election of Donald Trump, but the Bank admitted it was monitoring the president elect\u2019s Twitter account given his potential for market moving comments. The Bank members also spent some time defending the latest bank stress tests, notably to suggestions they were not rigorous enough. And there were also concerns about the high levels of consumer credit. And after some discussion about the buy to let market, the session ends. Chair Andrew Tyrie says that \u201c as usual when we start talking about financial stability we end with the housing market\u201d, and thanks them for coming. Is housing market sustainable, with prices relative to income back to levels seen in 2008? Alex Brazier: That rise in level in house prices relative to income has not, as it did in 2008, meant a rise in household debt. It\u2019s not house prices per se, it\u2019s the level of household debt, and [that] shows a completely different picture. Question on the 10.8% growth in consumer credit last year. Is the Bank too relaxed or complacent about this? FPC executive director Alex Brazier says he\u2019s not relaxed: Consumer credit growth is difficult to ignore. What are the risks to financial stability? We have been discussing the loosening of credit conditions, such as a doubling of interest rate free periods for credit cards. We need to be alert and vigilant. It has been a driver of consumer spending, so it\u2019s important how we should address it, as it has a broader economic resilience. Carney and his committee defend the results of the tests, but says he welcomes analysis and discussion ( such as by the head of an independent review of banks Sir John Vickers, who said the stress tests were not rigorous enough.) An ITV report said using more rigorous tests would have meant only Lloyds passed, but Carney and co said they could not see how this result was achieved and seemed satisfied with the outcome of their own tests. Anil Kashyap says he expects it will become exceptional for UK banks to fail the stress test in future. Question on bank stress tests, when RBS failed in November: Should we expect every year to see at least one bank fail so we can\u2019t say they are not difficult enough. Martin Taylor: People say that anyway. We don\u2019t consider that. We try to set stress which is severe and plausible and put the system through the wringer. Meanwhile the pound has hit a new 31 year low against the dollar - excluding the flash crash - with the US currency boosted ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on hopes of details of his plans for the country\u2019s economy. Sterling has fallen as low as $1.2039 and is now down 1% at $1.2056. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The move looks dollar driven with the buck heavy bid at day highs across the board ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s news conference. It\u2019s now looking very precarious indeed for sterling and we could see it drop further as stops are triggered. Cable is down another 1% today and is flirting with flash crash lows and could spark more selling. The correlation between the pound and the FTSE is obvious. The sharp move south at 15:18 saw sterling dip half a cent against the dollar in just a minute and we witnessed a corresponding move in the FTSE 100 at the exact same time, with the index jumping 10 points in 60 seconds. At pixel time it was rocking new highs at 7,321, on course for yet another record close. Question: Do you monitor Trump\u2019s Twitter account in case he says something,. Carney: Yes. We monitor your Twitter account, chairman. So yes we follow it. We look forward to working with the new US members. Tyrie: is Trump a risk to financial stability? Anil Kashyap: The committee hasn\u2019t discussed this but personally, the first thing will be Trump filling the vice chair position at Federal Reserve. That could change the way the Fed negotiates over financial stability issues. It still takes 60 votes in Senate to do many things, anything attached to tax and spending review you need 50. Anything to do with rolling back Dodd Franks, they can\u2019t do that will just 50 votes. He can do personal changes immediately. Tyrie: so has risk up or stayed the same? The same, the number of things the US can do unilaterally that he can trigger is limited in the short term. Carney says what is true is that growth has been remarkably weak and the general level of income growth has been weak... which is a product of meagre productivity performance in this country. Mann: Do you regard inequality as a problem? Carney says the level of wealth and income inequality has gone down over the last decade, the level has gone up among generations. Since interest rates fell and QE introduced, wealth and income has risen. Is inequality an issue in this county? One of the issues is that in general within advanced economies increases in inequality have some potential to reduce the equilibrium interest rate. That means running the economy for some time with low interest rates which runs greater risk to financial stability. As Carney speaks, the FTSE 100 has crossed the 7300 line. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With Mark Carney stating \u2013 after a bit of coercion from the Treasury Select Committee \u2013 that Brexit is no longer the signal most significant domestic risk to the UK\u2019s financial stability the FTSE received the final push it needed to cross 7300 this Wednesday. The comments also helped to lift the pound against the euro, but failed to have much impact on sterling\u2019s losses against the dollar, with the greenback taking half a percent off of the UK currency. Carney says we are starting to get an increase in inflation and a slowdown in growth has not yet transpired. John Mann: are none of you surprised at the health of the economy. Martin Taylor: I\u2019m surprised, it is better than I expected. The conclusions drawn about forecasters are wrong: that they\u2019re hopeless, politically biased, or there\u2019s been some miracle in the economy. It is more prosaic. There is no precedent for major country to tear up trade deals and go off into a new world. Any forecaster has got to suppose there will be a confidence effect. The mistake was not to forecast the scale of the confidence effect on the consumer. They\u2019ve got on with their lives, partly thanks to consumer credit. Rees Mogg: But the forecasts were inaccurate. Carney: Speaking as the MPC, the MPC had a more positive forecast than others in August, it took action to reinforce the situation, it upgraded its forecasts. \u201cI would say, and I\u2019ll say this very lightly, that recent data would be consistent with some further upgrade of the forecast but that forecast has not yet started\u201d We have expected there will be some slowing of the economy this year, related to some effects of Brexit. Missing the financial crisis is a big deal, a couple of different quarters is nice to have, it\u2019s a different order of magnitude. Rees Mogg continues: But the forecasting around Brexit was just as inaccurate as before the financial crisis of 2008. Carney says the risk aspect around Brexit was right and the steps we took (helped mitigate it). There was hard money in the market, a lot of major institutions would have been caught on the wrong side. The reason they weren\u2019t is Bank identified risk of outcomes of Brexit vote and took it off the table. Bank ensured markets especially derivatives markets were liquid [ahead of the vote}. On the morning after... it was important the system was rock solid. So the assessment was right in terms of the risk and the steps taken to mitigate the risk were necessary. In that sense, we were making the weather. On forecasting Carney says the way we have to get better - and it has improved - is by looking at what could go wrong rather than just what could go right. In subprime a lot of time was spent saying there wasn\u2019t a problem rather than saying, if there is a problem, what could go wrong? Away from Carney for a moment, and an update on the state of the UK economy. UK ouput grew by 0.5% in the three months ending in December 2016, after the same level of growth in the three months to November, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The thinktank said it estimated the economy grew by 2% in 2016, compared to 2.2% in 2015. But there could be clouds ahead. James Warren, Research Fellow at NIESR, said \u201cOur estimates suggest the economy grew by 2 per cent in 2016, in line with the long run potential growth rate of the UK economy. The composition of economic growth in 2016 has been unbalanced: robust consumer spending has compensated for the weakness in other sectors. Consumers face significant headwinds this year and next, not least the increase in consumer price inflation that is a consequence of pass through from the depreciation of sterling in 2016.\u201d Rees Mogg turns to Carney now and forecasting. On the Michael Fish quote, he says Fish\u2019s boss apologised for the hurricane mistake 24 years later, so they may call Carney back in 24 years time. Carney does not look amused. Kashyap says Brexit will be a leap and we have no certainty how well it will go. And now Jacob Rees Mogg, who has clashed with Carney before. He starts though with Martin Taylor, and asks how Brexit will affect ways of looking at stability. Taylor says, it depends on result of the arrangements we\u2019ve been talking about. Member Anil Kashyap says Bank will resist low regulation, light touch approach as much as it can after Brexit. Rees Mogg There has not been any great impact so far [from the Brexit vote}, but the Bank had been quite concerned. Taylor: The Bank was quite concerned, we were concerned to provide liquidity ahead of the vote, and after to make sure business as usual. The third phase will be after Brexit happens. The phase we\u2019re now in will throw up its own challenges. I don\u2019t share view that because there has not been a problem yet there won\u2019t be one in future. It becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle what was due to Brexit and what would have happened anyway. Carney says it is possible and desirable for UK to remain part of the EU customs union. This is the way the global economy should work, he says. He adds the Bank\u2019s FPC itself has not taken a view on whether the UK should stay. My colleague Jill Treanor writes: Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, appears to started something yesterday when he likened the risks of Brexit to Jenga. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of Treasury select committee, has been asking Mark Carney about it today. The governor of the Bank of England has admitted it is a \u201cdecent analogy\u201d. \u201cJust like when you play Jenga and you start early there are some pieces you can take out without imperilling the tower\u201d says Carney.The Jenga problem starts when capacity is taken out of the market. The argument being that the EU 27 relies on the City for its financing and, argues Carney, faces a greater risk to financial stability than the UK from Brexit. Question: Are there any substantive reasons - leaving aside political reasons - the EU would not grant the UK equivalence, treating UK financial rules as equivalent to EU ones? No, not at all, says Carney. Carney says we don\u2019t want to be a rule taker. We feel the regulatory construct within the EU is as we would have it. Once we\u2019re not there, I expect we will get rules with which we don\u2019t agree. We want equivalance with EU rules, but not cutting and pasting EU rule changes. Earlier Carney agreed that describing the stability of the UK financial system after Brexit as a game of jenga was a decent analogy. If the permanance of access to EU financial markets comes into question, it would raise economic and financial stability issues. The British government would have to make political choices on EU access. One of the Bank\u2019s FPC members Martin Taylor says it is important to get EU transitional arrangements in place as soon as possible. On a transitional arrangement, Carney says it is in the interests of UK and the EU27 that there is a transition phase. Is it necessary to avoid serious risks, ask Tyrie. \u201cit is the best mitigant to those risks, highly advisable. If there is not such a transition, we will work to mitigate those consqeences. The consequences would be higher for EU but there would also be consequences for the UK.\u201d Tyrie asks if Brexit is still the most significant risk to financial stability. Carney is trying not to be drawn, saying the biggest risks to the Uk economy are external, but the Bank also identified four domestic risks. Tyrie presses whether Brexit is still the most signifiant internal risk. A pause then Carney says the Bank\u2019s committee has not termed it that way. \u201cWe have four risks, Brexit amplifies some of those risks,\u201d Tyrie persists: \u201cYes or no\u201d Carney: \u201cNo. In the run up to the referendum we felt it was largest risk because there were things that could have happened which had financial stability implications. Actions were taken to mitigate that, but having got through the day after, the scale of the immediate risks has gone down.\u201d Mark Carney is up at the select committee, and is immediatly asked by chair Andrew Tyrie whether he agrees with Andy Haldane\u2019s assessment that forecasters had a Michael Fish moment, in failing to predict the outcome of various events including Brexit. Carney bats this away, saying one advantage of abolishing group think is that you don\u2019t always agree with colleagues. He said Haldane was talking about ability to identify risk, he suggested some solutions but our responsibity to financial stability is to identify it and take mitigating action. The probe with success is the risk doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cI do think we helped make the weather [around the time of the vote], we mitigated risk and put country in better place.\u201d (Carney is talking about the interest rate cut and other actions the bank took the day after the vote)arrangements. Over in parliament governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is set to face the Treasury Select Committee shortly. Carney is being quizzed on the Bank\u2019s financial stability report at the end of November, which saw RBS fail the latest stress tests and the Bank warn on a number of matters, including the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, the commercial property sector, high level of debts in UK households and the potential vulnerability of the economy to a reduction in foreign investors buying UK debt. After its record breaking run of nine closing highs, the FTSE 100 is continuing to move ahead. The leading index, again boosted by mining shares benefitting from the weak pound and supermarkets following Sainsbury\u2019s well received update, has hit a new peak of 7296. This is tantalisingly close to the 7300 level but whether the UK index follows Wall Street\u2019s pattern - the Dow Jones Industrial Average was on the verge of breaking 20,000 last week before falling back - remains to be seen. Currently the FTSE 100 is up 0.25% at 7293. Speaking of the Dow, it is virtually flat ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s press conference later, which may see some detail about his plans to boost the economy and may also get some questions about other matters. WEF also asks its panellists to list their greatest risks, in terms of the impact they would have on the global economy. Between 2007 and 2014, this list was always topped by financial worries -- such as asset price crashes, a fiscal crisis, or a major failure of the whole system But this year, the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction has climbed to the top of the list, followed by a string of environmental worries. One obvious problem with the World Economic Forum\u2019s global risks report is that Davos is stuffed each year with the politicians, business leaders, economists and other \u2018global elite\u2019 who have led the global economy to its current state. Issues such as climate change and economic inequality have been creeping up WEF\u2019s agenda for several years -- \u2018severe income disparity\u2019 was ranked as the most likely danger to the economy in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Indeed, three years ago Davos began with a stern lecture from the Pope to improve wealth equality and help those in \u2018dire poverty. It is intolerable that thousands of people continue to die every day from hunger, even though substantial quantities are available and wasted. But none of this halted the push towards populism that gripped 2016, and could do the same next year too. Speaking on Bloomberg earlier, WEF\u2019s head of global competitiveness, Margareta Drzeniek-Hanouz, said this year\u2019s Davos gathering will seek solutions to income inequality. She argued that Davos is open to populist voices, as elected politicians should represent the view of the people, along with representatives of civic society, charities, etc. But Jenny Ricks of the Fight Inequality Alliance, for example, isn\u2019t convinced that the Davos elite will find the answers. WEF\u2019s report also highlights that the richest 1% in the US have done particularly well over the last few decades. And with great timing, a group of economists at the Norwegian School of Economics and Stockholm University have published the results of an experiment into whether Americans are more relaxed than Norwegians about inequality. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The researchers wanted to assess how people reacted to inequality that stemmed from brute luck. Spectators were told that worker A and worker B did work of the same quality but that in a lottery it had been randomly decided the entire $6 earnings bonus would go to worker A. The spectators were asked if they would like to leave things as they were or redistribute the bonus between the two workers. The researchers\u2019 findings were striking.Among Norwegian spectators, 80% chose to redistribute the bonus and make it equal between the two workers. Among Americans only 50% chose to share it out. They also found that Americans were much more reluctant to redistribute bonuses paid on merit..... More here: Climate change dangers also dominate the risk landscape for 2017, WEF says. Its global risks report singles out the danger of extreme weather events, as both the likeliest threat and one of the most damaging (beaten only by the dangers of weapons of mass destruction). Water crises, often caused by changes to the weather, also features high up the list of dangers (continuing a recent trend), along with the risk that governments fail to mitigate against climate change. WEF says: This year, environmental concerns are more prominent than ever, with all five risks in this category assessed as being above average for both impact and likelihood.... Iineffective management of the \u201cglobal commons\u201d \u2013 the oceans, atmosphere, and climate system \u2013 can have local as well as global consequences. For example, changing weather patterns or water crises can trigger or exacerbate geopolitical and societal risks such as domestic or regional conflict and involuntary migration, particularly WEF\u2019s report argues that income inequality can\u2019t be solely blamed for Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Instead, it singles out the rapid changes in society over the last few decades that left many feeling left behind, or treated unfairly. Early analysis by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris points to the populism behind the victories of Brexit and President-elect Trump as being driven more by demographics and cultural factors than income inequality: a backlash among older and less-educated voters who \u201cfeel that they are being marginalized within their own countries\u201d by changing values in areas such as gender, sexual orientation, race, multiculturalism, environmental protection and international cooperation. Pew research found stark divisions in the self-described values of supporters of President-elect Trump and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton: for example, 72% of President-elect Trump\u2019s supporters described themselves as \u201ctraditional\u201d, versus 31% of Clinton supporters; other big differences included \u201chonor and duty are my core values\u201d (59% vs 35%); \u201ctypical American\u201d (72% vs 49%), \u201cfeminist\u201d (5% vs 38%) and \u201csupporter of LGBT rights\u201d (24% vs 66%). New technologies such as self-driving cars and smart robots could also threaten global stability in the years ahead, according to today\u2019s report. WEF\u2019s experts said that artificial intelligence and robotics is \u201cthe emerging technology with the greatest potential for negative consequences over the coming decade\u201d. That\u2019s because tens of millions of jobs will be lost as work is increasingly handed to automated systems, in the so-called \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d. The report says: Estimates of the number of jobs at risk to technological displacement vary: a frequently cited 2013 Oxford Martin School study has suggested that 47% of US jobs were at high risk from automation; in 2016 an OECD working paper put the figure lower, at 9%. In 2015 a McKinsey study concluded that 45% of the activities that workers do today could already be automated if companies choose to do so..... Technology has always created jobs as well as destroying them, but there is evidence that the engine of technological job creation is sputtering. The Oxford Martin School estimates that only 0.5% of today\u2019s US workforce is employed in sectors created since 2000, compared with approximately 8% in industries created during the 1980s. Technological change is shifting the distribution of income from labour to capital: according to the OECD, up to 80% of the decline in labour\u2019s share of national income between 1990 and 2007 was the result of the impact of technology. Cecilia Reyes, chief risk officer at Zurich, says these changes are a key cause of social instability. WEF singles out Donald Trump\u2019s victory and the Brexit vote as the \u201chighest-profile signs\u201d of rising political discontent. Today\u2019s report says: That discontent with the current order has now become an election-winning proposition clearly increases the urgency of understanding and responding to these global risks. But what\u2019s the solution? WEF has a five-point plan: fostering greater solidarity and long-term thinking in market capitalism, revitalizing global economic growth, recognizing the importance of identity and inclusiveness in healthy political communities, mitigating the risks and exploiting the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and strengthening our systems of global cooperation. WEF say that anger over economic inequality could shake the \u201csocial solidarity\u201d that underpins the status quo -- especially as global growth has been weak since the financial crisis. The report warns that: In sum, it is difficult to identify routes that will lead back to robust global rates of economic growth. However, growth is now only part of the challenge policymakers need to address. Concerns over income and wealth distribution are becoming more politically disruptive, and much greater emphasis is needed on the increasing financial insecurity that characterizes many people\u2019s lives. As socio-economic outcomes are increasingly determined globally, popular frustration is growing at the inability of national politics to provide stability. Economist Dani Rodrik coined the phrase \u201cthe globalization trilemma\u201d to capture his view that, among democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration, only two are simultaneously compatible \u2013 and recent events in Europe and the United States suggest an appetite for rebalancing towards democracy and national sovereignty. The combination of economic inequality and political polarization threatens to amplify global risks, fraying the social solidarity on which the legitimacy of our economic and political systems rests. Blimey. The World Economic Forum has admitted that \u201cfundamental reforms\u201d to market capitalism may be needed, to tackle the public anger that led to Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. Setting the scene for next week\u2019s Davos, today\u2019s Global Risks Report points out that the public are losing faith with the status quo. (ie, many of the people who trek to the Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Switzerland). WEF says public anger is now a global issue: Years of building pressure in many parts of the world, at least since the global financial crisis, crystallized into dramatic political results during 2016 as public disaffection with the status quo gained traction. In the West, consensus expectations were defied by the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the United States and by the Italian electorate\u2019s rejection of Matteo Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms. The implications of results such as these are potentially far-reaching \u2013 some people question whether the West has reached a tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalization. But the uncertainty and instability that characterized 2016 are not Western phenomena alone: we saw variations of them in countries across the world, including Brazil, the Philippines and Turkey. Crucially, WEF acknowledges that simply encouraging economic growth is not the answer. Instead, fundamental reforms are needed to tackle anger against the richest in society. The report states: Despite unprecedented levels of peace and global prosperity, in many countries a mood of economic malaise has contributed to anti-establishment, populist politics and a backlash against globalization. The weakness of the economic recovery following the global financial crisis is part of this story, but boosting growth alone would not remedy the deeper fractures in our political economy. More fundamental reforms to market capitalism may be needed to tackle, in particular, an apparent lack of solidarity between those at the top of national income and wealth distributions and those further down. WEF also produced this chart, showing how the recovery since 2008 has been the weakest in at least 40 years: You can see the report here: WEF: Global Risks Report 2017 WEF are presenting the findings at a press conference now - it\u2019s being streamed here. This chart from WEF shows how the world economy faces an interconnected web of risks. \u2018Rising income and wealth inequality\u2019 is the most important, according to the 700 experts surveyed for this report, due to unemployment and its link to social instability. Here\u2019s the top five trends that will determine the future of the global economy ove the next decade, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Risks report. Rising Income and wealth disparity Changing climate Increasing polarization of societies Rising cyber dependency Ageing population Newsflash: The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Risks Report 2017 is just being released. And it singles out \u201ceconomic inequality\u201d as the biggest issue in the global economy over the next decade, as income and wealth disparity continues to rise. The polarization of societies, and \u201cintensifying environmental dangers\u201d are the other top three trends that will shape global developments over the next 10 years. The report warns that: Trends such as rising income inequality and societal polarization triggered political change in 2016 and could exacerbate global risks in 2017 if urgent action is not taken, according to the Global Risks Report 2017 WEF says that world leaders need to \u201curgently\u201d work together to avert further hardship and volatility in the coming decade. Here\u2019s the key bullet points from the report: Patterns persist. Rising income and wealth disparity and increasing polarization of societies were ranked first and third, respectively, among the underlying trends that will determine global developments in the next ten years. Similarly, the most interconnected pairing of risks in this year\u2019s survey is between high structural unemployment or underemployment and profound social instability. The environment dominates the global risks landscape. Climate change was the number two underlying trend this year. And for the first time, all five environmental risks in the survey were ranked both high-risk and high-likelihood, with extreme weather events emerging as the single most prominent global risk. Society is not keeping pace with technological change. Of the 12 emerging technologies examined in the report, experts found artificial intelligence and robotics to have the greatest potential benefits, but also the greatest potential negative effects and the greatest need for better governance. More to follow... A few eyebrows were raised in the City when Sainsbury\u2019s launched a takeover bid for catalogue retailer Argos last year. But no-one\u2019s carping now, after the supermarket chain released forecast-beating results over the Christmas period, mainly thanks to a 4% jump in like-for-like sales at Argos. That\u2019s sent Sainsbury\u2019s shares up 6% this morning, to the top of the FTSE 100. More here: Over in the City, estate agent Foxtons\u2019 shares have hit their lowest level ever after another disappointing financial statement. It admitted that core profits almost halved for 2016 to \u00a325m, from \u00a346m in 2015, as it suffers from the slowdown in the London property market since the EU referendum. Sales in the last quarter of 2016 dropped to just \u00a312m, from \u00a320m, as \u201cvolumes remained subdued\u201d. And this year won\u2019t be much better, warned CEO Nic Budden: Looking ahead, we expect trading conditions to remain challenging in 2017. Should current levels of sales activity continue in the short term, it is likely that 2017 volumes will be below those in 2016. Our balanced business model provides resilience against sales market cycles and we have a strong balance sheet with no debt. This sent Foxtons shares down by 10% in early trading to just 90p, the lowest since the company floated on the stock market in 2013. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The World Economic Forum is releasing its Global Risks Report for 2017, at 9am, to set the scene for next week\u2019s meeting in Davos. This report will identify the five biggest threats to the world, and what needs to be done to protect us from their worst effects. After a dramatic 2016, geopolitics will loom large on this year\u2019s report -- given the imminent arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Climate Change, migration, cybercrime and pandemics could also feature highly too. WEF, which is one of the cheerleaders for globalisation, is concerned that that the recent rise of populism will undermine global efforts to work together on these problems. It says: 2016 saw a crystallization of political risks that have led to the election of populist leaders, a loss of faith in institutions and increased strain on international cooperation. We should not be surprised by this: for the past decade, the Global Risks Report has been drawing attention to persistent economic, social and political factors that have been shaping our risks landscape. The report comes hot on the heels of a new report from the World Bank, released last night, which cites Brexit and president-elect Trump as key threats to growth this year. The World Bank\u2019s Global Economic Prospects report warns that: \u201cThe heightened level of policy uncertainty, especially regarding trade, has been exacerbated by recent political developments \u2013 most notably in the United States and the United Kingdom. \u201cThis and other risks \u2013 particularly financial market disruptions amid tighter global financing conditions \u2013 may be amplified over time by mounting protectionist tendencies, slower potential growth and elevated vulnerabilities in some emerging markets and developing countries.\u201d Also coming up today.... The City look a little subdued today, with the FTSE 100 expected to dip this morning after hitting its record-breaking ninth record closing high in a row yesterday. There\u2019s a splurge of UK economy data at 9.30am, with new trade and industrial production surveys for November. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is testifying to parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee at 2.15pm today, to discuss last month\u2019s financial stability report. This means another battle with eurosceptic MPs who criticise its warnings ahead of June\u2019e EU referendum, and its actions since. On the corporate front, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s, estate agent Foxtons, and cinema chain Cineworld are reporting results.",

But other factors have also been at play. These include higher commodity prices, the resilience of the UK economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit and spill-over effects from Trump\u2019s election victory. Looking ahead, we remain positive on the FTSE 100, but don\u2019t expect it to make much more headway.</p> <p>We doubt that there is much life left in the FTSE 100 rally.. Indeed, we forecast that it will end 2017 at 7,500, which is only about 3% above its level today. Granted, we expect the UK economy to continue to fare quite well. However, there are three reasons why we are cautious.</p> <p>First, we forecast a small gain in sterling in trade-weighted terms, as a further decline against the dollar (to $1.20/\u00a3 from $1.23/\u00a3) is more than offset by a rise against the euro (to \u20ac1.26/\u00a3 from \u20ac1.15/\u00a3). Second, we expect the rally in oil prices to peter out. Our end-year forecast for Brent crude is $60pb, which is not much above its price today (around $56pb). And third, we think the US stock market will run out of steam, as the enthusiasm with which shareholders greeted Trump\u2019s victory starts to wane and profit margins are squeezed. Our end-2017 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 is only 2,300, which is barely above its level now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5877a0dde4b0f10ba20b7732\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T15:31:13.609Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commenting on the market falls, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After briefly sneaking into positive territory the FTSE slipped back into the red this afternoon, with the index\u2019s 2017 winning streak potentially about to come to an end.</p> <p>Despite a largely healthy set of commodity stocks, and a wave of positive Christmas updates from its key retailers, it seems like there was just too much going on for the FTSE this Thursday. The negative reaction to some of those trading statements, most notably Tesco and Primark-owner Associated British Foods, alongside the pound\u2019s rebound against the dollar, largely prompted by the greenback\u2019s own weaknesses, prevented the UK index from building beyond the 7300 it struck yesterday.</p> <p>Over in the US things took a rather sharp turn downwards, with the Dow Jones plunging by 150 points after the bell. It seems that both the Dow and the dollar are still displeased with the lack of policy detail in Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on Wednesday.

Despite the stock market crash in China, Brexit, Turkey, Trump and Italy, the economy performed its best growth year since 2011.

In fact, the often controversially discussed refugee crisis and the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy turned out to be an economic blessing, artificially extending the long, positive cycle of the economy. The year 2017 will in our view look very much like 2016, only with a bit less of everything. Domestic demand, ie construction and both private and public consumption, should remain the main growth drivers. The biggest risk for the economy is not Trump or political populism in the Eurozone but self-complacency. The economy urgently needs new impetus from new structural reforms and stronger public and private investment.

Once again, the major driver was domestic demand in the form of private and public consumer expenditures and not export activity. Imports were even outpacing exports last year. Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in good shape. The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a (moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity. What can go wrong? It goes without saying that there are substantial political risks, especially from the US, which could have an (indirect) impact on German exports. Whether and how this will play out still remains to be seen. For 2017, we expect \u201conly\u201d GDP growth of 1.5%. Please note that the reason for the drop is NOT based on fundamentals and definitely not a reason to be worried.

                "bodyText":"As the dollar weakened and US markets fell on disappointment at the lack of details of Donald Trump\u2019s economic plans at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, markets suffered a tricky day. The FTSE 100 fell back initially as the pound gained ground, hitting overseas earners, and pharmaceutical shares dropped after Trump\u2019s talk of clamping down on the prices they charged for their medicines. But as the pound dipped later in the session, the FTSE 100 just about managed to end in positive territory, its 11th successive closing high. But in Europe a rise in the euro - due to the weak dollar as well as the minutes of the last ECB meeting - left markets flagging. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.88 points or 0.03% at 7292.37 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.07% to 11,521.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.51% at 4863.97 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.69% to 19,156.59 Spain\u2019s Ibex edged down 0.01% to 9407.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.28% to 665.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 20 points at 19,834 - well off the 20,000 barrier it almost breached last Friday. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 rally might not have much further to go, says Capital Economics. The think tank\u2019s John Higgins said: It is tempting to attribute the FTSE 100\u2019s winning streak to a renewed plunge in sterling. But other factors have also been at play. These include higher commodity prices, the resilience of the UK economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit and spill-over effects from Trump\u2019s election victory. Looking ahead, we remain positive on the FTSE 100, but don\u2019t expect it to make much more headway. We doubt that there is much life left in the FTSE 100 rally.. Indeed, we forecast that it will end 2017 at 7,500, which is only about 3% above its level today. Granted, we expect the UK economy to continue to fare quite well. However, there are three reasons why we are cautious. First, we forecast a small gain in sterling in trade-weighted terms, as a further decline against the dollar (to $1.20/\u00a3 from $1.23/\u00a3) is more than offset by a rise against the euro (to \u20ac1.26/\u00a3 from \u20ac1.15/\u00a3). Second, we expect the rally in oil prices to peter out. Our end-year forecast for Brent crude is $60pb, which is not much above its price today (around $56pb). And third, we think the US stock market will run out of steam, as the enthusiasm with which shareholders greeted Trump\u2019s victory starts to wane and profit margins are squeezed. Our end-2017 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 is only 2,300, which is barely above its level now. Commenting on the market falls, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: After briefly sneaking into positive territory the FTSE slipped back into the red this afternoon, with the index\u2019s 2017 winning streak potentially about to come to an end. Despite a largely healthy set of commodity stocks, and a wave of positive Christmas updates from its key retailers, it seems like there was just too much going on for the FTSE this Thursday. The negative reaction to some of those trading statements, most notably Tesco and Primark-owner Associated British Foods, alongside the pound\u2019s rebound against the dollar, largely prompted by the greenback\u2019s own weaknesses, prevented the UK index from building beyond the 7300 it struck yesterday. Over in the US things took a rather sharp turn downwards, with the Dow Jones plunging by 150 points after the bell. It seems that both the Dow and the dollar are still displeased with the lack of policy detail in Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on Wednesday. Especially disgruntled are the US pharmaceutical stocks, the likes of Shire and Pfizer continuing yesterday\u2019s losses after the President-elect claimed that the sector was \u2018getting away with murder\u2019 in regards to drug prices. In the Eurozone, meanwhile, the DAX and CAC incurred some hefty losses as the euro hit a one month high against the dollar and took 0.3% off the pound. The currency appeared to be prompted by the latest ECB meeting minutes released this afternoon, with the central bank apparently fairly divided ahead of their to extend QE at a reduced rate of purchase. It looks like the chances of the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking through the 20,000 barrier in the near future are getting slimmer, nor is the FTSE 100 currently on course to continue its record breaking run of closing highs. The Dow is currently down 144 points at 19,810 on continuing disappointment with the lack of detail from Donald Trump on his spending and tax plans. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has slipped 9 points to 7281, having climbed as high as 7302 and fallen as low as 7263. Back with UK retailers, and we\u2019ve taken a look at the Christmas winners and losers so far. (Spoiler: most of them are winners). The full report is here: With the dollar weakening after president-elect Donald Trump failed to spell out any spending or tax plans in Wednesday\u2019s press conference, US markets have fallen back in early trading. After ending nearly 100 points higher on Wednesday after a volatile session as Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now gone into reverse, down 75 points or 0.37% to 19.879. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped around 0.3% at the open. US markets, indeed global markets, have seen sharp rises recently, partly fuelled by Trump\u2019s declarations of increased spending and other measures to boost the economy. Investors had been hoping for more details at Wednesday\u2019s event, but in the end were disappointed. Oil prices are moving higher on reports that Opec members are sticking to the production cuts agreed last November. Reuters reports: Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq told [an Abu Dhabi] conference Kuwait had already cut its oil output by more than it promised under the OPEC deal, without giving further details. Iraq Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told reporters Iraq was \u201choping for a better price\u201d. Iraq had reduced its oil exports by 170,000 bpd and was cutting them by a further 40,000 bpd this week, he said. BMI Research said overall \u201ccompliance to the OPEC/non-OPEC oil production cut appears to be positive ... We calculate compliance with production cuts at around 73 percent,\u201d led by high compliance from members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, namely Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. Crude has also been boosted by news of record Chinese car sales, which grew by 13.7% in 2016. Brent is currently up 2.12% at $56.27 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has climbed 2.05% to $53.32. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by less than expected last week. Initial benefit claims rose by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, compared to forecasts of an increase to 255,000. The previous week\u2019s figure of 235,000 was revised upwards by 2,000, the US Labor Department said. The benefit claim number has been below 300,000 - a level seen as indicating a healthy jobs market - for 97 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970. The euro has hit a one month high of $1.0683 against the dollar after the ECB minutes showed a split on extending the central bank\u2019s bond buying programme. The rise is also due to weakness in the dollar following a lack of detail about Donald Trump\u2019s spending and tax plans at Wednesday\u2019s press conference. The European Central Bank\u2019s decision to extend its bond buying programme followed signs of a continuing moderate recovery in the eurozone economy, but insufficient progress towards a sustained pick up in inflation. At its December meeting the ECB decided to extend the programme by nine months to December 2017 but cut the monthly amount of bonds bought from \u20ac80bn to \u20ac60bn, but there were some differences of opinion according to the just-released minutes. Some members initially preferred to keep things as they were, as that had the merit of continuity and was in line with market expectations. But the minutes said the option of extending the programme \u201callowed for a more sustained market presence and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of the Governing Council\u2019s stimulus measures.\u201d And it meant that if the recovery faltered the decision could be reversed. The minutes said: \u201cAt the same time, if the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the inflation path, the Governing Council could return to a pace of \u20ac80 billion per month.\u201d So although the change was eventually implemented, some members remained opposed: \u201cA few members could not support either of the two options that had been proposed, while welcoming the scaling-down of purchases and other elements of the proposals, in view of their well-known general scepticism regarding the APP [asset purchase programme] and public debt purchases in particular.\u201d After a volatile performance during president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s press conference, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 98 points higher at 19,954, heading back towards the elusive 20,000 barrier. But the futures market is suggesting the Dow will dip back down again at the open, with a fall of around 42 points forecast at the moment. The weekly jobless figures, due before the US market opens, could have some influence and are expected to rise from last week\u2019s near 43 year low. Here\u2019s our story on the John Lewis bonus cut. Sarah Butler writes: John Lewis has warned that its annual bonus for staff will be significantly lower than last year as it prepares to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in sterling. Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned group, which includes Waitrose, said he anticipated a \u201cchallenging\u201d year ahead as retailers would have to absorb a big chunk of the rising cost of importing goods just as they are coping with shoppers\u2019 shift to buying online.... Mayfield said the devaluation of sterling was \u201cone of the most significant factors overhanging the outlook for the year ahead.\u201d This will be the fourth consecutive year that the group, which is collectively owned by its staff, has reduced the payout, but it is highly unusual for it to cut the bonus when profits rise. Last year its 91,500 employees, known as partners, were awarded bonuses of 10% of salary, the lowest for 13 years, averaging just over \u00a31,500 each. The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011. The full report is here: Here\u2019s a quick roundup of the day\u2019s main retail updates from George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The first set of positive like-for-likes in the Clothing and Home division for almost two years is the main headline at M&amp;S. While last year\u2019s frankly abysmal performance was hardly a tough benchmark to beat, investors will be hoping that Steve Rowe\u2019s plans to revitalise the group gain some traction and this marks the start of a more positive trajectory. There was some Christmas cheer at M&amp;S\u2019 high street rival Debenhams too. The group gathered momentum through the all-important Christmas quarter, rounding it off in style by upping like-for-like sales by 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January. It wasn\u2019t just in stores that things look brighter either. Online sales jumped 17% in that period. It was more of a mixed bag at John Lewis, however. While sales growth of almost 5% means that the tills were certainly ringing, the group says that greater challenges across the retail sector, notably the continuing shift to online, means that profit is likely to come under pressure. Unfortunately for those at the group, the likely upshot here is a significantly lower bonus than last year. To see evidence of that shift to online spending, look no further than the 30% sales growth that Asos pulled in at the back end of last year. With more customers ordering more often, expectations for full year sales growth have been raised, but this means extra investment too. The group will need to spend another \u00a330m to keep up with the relentlessly increasing demand. This is one of the better problems to have, we feel. Primark owner Associated British Foods doesn\u2019t do online shopping. Instead, the focus for the retail division is on rolling out its pile it high, sell it cheap format across Europe and the US. With expansion continuing apace, investors may be excused for being a touch disappointed by the 11% growth in sales reported today. Square footage increased by 12% in the last year. Still with the economy, and eurozone industrial production rose more sharply than expected in November. Output climbed by 1.5% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% increase. Year on year it rose 3.2%, much better than the 1.6% expected. The October figures were revised upwards, with a 0.1% rise month on month compared to an earlier reported fall of 0.1%. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After stuttering throughout the summer, industrial production in the eurozone bounced back with a vengeance in November, which will give the ECB serious grounds for confidence at this early stage in 2017. The outlook remains weighed down by continued political uncertainty, but the recovery in the region is gathering some real momentum. Unemployment is falling, business confidence is up and the weak euro is a real boost for exporters. Although Mario Draghi and his ECB colleagues are still faced with some very real political threats, the economy is standing up well in the face of adversity. The ECB is due to announce its latest monetary policy deliberations next Thursday. Back with the industrial production figures and Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit, was also positive but warned of an uncertain outlook: Even allowing for the fact that industrial production has been highly erratic, November\u2019s jump reinforces our belief that Eurozone GDP growth could well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016. This would be up from 0.3% in both the third and second quarters. It appears that the Eurozone manufacturing sector carried decent momentum into 2017, and they will be helped by the very competitive euro... Looking ahead, a concern for Eurozone manufacturers will be that mounting uncertainty over the coming months (particularly political) could cause business and consumers to be cautious in their major spending decisions, thereby constraining demand for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods It is also very possible that purchasing power for Eurozone consumers\u2019 will become less favourable as inflation picks up, thereby weighing down on demand for big-ticket consumer durables. In particular, an uncertain political environment could be increasingly problematic for Eurozone growth prospects over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u2019s Brexit vote last June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (in September), while a 2017 election is very possible in Italy following Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s early-December defeat in the referendum on constitutional reform which has led to his resignation. And Capital Economics pointed out: Good news for the eurozone as the Germany economy, the major driver of growth in the region, recorded its best performance for five years in 2016. German GDP grew by 1.9% last year, up from 1.7% in 2015 and better than the expected 1.8% rise. The economy was boosted by strong domestic demand, compensating for sluggish demand for exports. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the German economy remained an \u201cisland of happiness\u201d, adding: The German economy has once again defied several deep hits. Despite the stock market crash in China, Brexit, Turkey, Trump and Italy, the economy performed its best growth year since 2011. Strong domestic demand has shielded the German economy against most external risks. And he said the biggest risk to future growth was complacency: [2016] was a year in which the German economy proved to be more robust than many thought and in which the economy weathered a series of external risks extremely well, thanks to strong domestic demand. In fact, the often controversially discussed refugee crisis and the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy turned out to be an economic blessing, artificially extending the long, positive cycle of the economy. The year 2017 will in our view look very much like 2016, only with a bit less of everything. Domestic demand, ie construction and both private and public consumption, should remain the main growth drivers. The biggest risk for the economy is not Trump or political populism in the Eurozone but self-complacency. The economy urgently needs new impetus from new structural reforms and stronger public and private investment. It is very unlikely that it will get any of these before the elections. UniCredit economist Andreas Rees was also positive: The German economy remains a stronghold of continuity. With plus 1.9% in 2016, its growth performance was rock solid and even accelerated to its strongest pace in the last five years (2015: +1.7%; 2014: +1.6%). Once again, the major driver was domestic demand in the form of private and public consumer expenditures and not export activity. Imports were even outpacing exports last year. Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in good shape. The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a (moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity. What can go wrong? It goes without saying that there are substantial political risks, especially from the US, which could have an (indirect) impact on German exports. Whether and how this will play out still remains to be seen. For 2017, we expect \u201conly\u201d GDP growth of 1.5%. Please note that the reason for the drop is NOT based on fundamentals and definitely not a reason to be worried. Instead, the lower number of working days is artificially weighing on the headline growth number (calendar-day adjusted growth in 2017: +1.8% after also +1.8% last year). Speaking of Donald Trump, one market moving comment in his press conference related to pharmaceutical companies. He said drugs companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d in the prices they charged and promised that would change. That sent US pharma stocks lower, and theat sentiment has carried over into Europe. So Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have all seen their shares fall. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: If pharmaceutical companies were hoping for an easier ride from President elect Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton they were quickly disabused of this notion last night when the President elect let rip at the industry\u2019s pricing policies. Last year was notable for a number of stories related to price gouging including the Mylan story around the Epipen price hikes, and Valeant\u2019s policy of buying older niche drugs and then hiking the prices aggressively, and the antipathy that resulted from these stories has made the industry an easy target for a President who may feel compelled to get some quick political wins. At a time when pharmaceutical companies were hoping for a more benign investment environment last night\u2019s remarks were a reminder, if any were needed, as well as a warning to the sector and other sectors as well, of the President elects propensity to adopt a scatter gun approach to domestic policy. Investors would do well to bear this in mind given that the recent stock market rally doesn\u2019t appear to have factored this into their investment scenarios. The Trump Presidency is unlikely to be a one way bet for stock markets. A stronger pound is also taking some of the shine off the leading index. One of the driving factors behind the recent surge in the FTSE 100 to record levels has been the weakness of sterling, which benefits overseas earners and makes UK assets more attractive to international investors. But disappointment that president-elect Donald Trump - in his first press conference since July - failed to spell out details of his plans to boost the US economy with infrastructure spending and new tax measure has sent the dollar lower. Against the US currency the pound has added 0.32% to $1.2252, although sterling is virtually flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1528. The FTSE 100 has slipped back after its record breaking run of ten consecutive closing highs, and is currently down 0.22% at 7274. Retailers have received a mixed reception to their Christmas updates, with Marks &amp; Spencer and JD Sports moving sharply higher, but Tesco, Primark owner Associated British Foods and AO World all disappointing investors. Stockbrokers Shore Capital are extremely unamused that Tesco, M&amp;S, Debenhams, ASOS et al all decided to release their results today in a \u201cchaotic\u201d splurge. They say: The British retail trade has decided to make many market updates today. Such dis-coordination, to put it politely, does not serve shareholders and investors well. Investor relations executives should hold their respective heads in shame at the chaotic volume of information coming out today whilst seeking for a more balanced information flow in 2018. As feared, AO World\u2019s cautious trading statement has gone down badly in the City. Shares in the online electrical supplier have slumped by 8.7%, after it warned that the economic outlook is uncertain. Conservative MP Margot James has applauded John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer for their Christmas performance: The Daily Mail\u2019s Sabah Meddings tweets more details: As if we didn\u2019t have enough to deal with, John Lewis has decided to put its Christmas trading figures out today too. And it has warned its staff that their famous annual bonus is likely to be rather lower this year, even though sales and profits have risen. Like-for-like sales at John Lewis stores rose by 2.7% in the six weeks to December 31, while Waitrose like-for-like sales were up 2.8%. A successful promotional campaign, including one day only offers for Christmas staples, such as champagne and crackers, proved effective in building footfall in the pre-Christmas period. Profits for the year to 28 January 2017 will probably be up on last year, thanks to lower pension charges. But JLP says that trading profits are under pressure, due to the boom in internet shopping and the fall in the pound. The most obvious of these changes is the channel shift from shops to online. The other major influence is pricing, where deflation continues in food and non-food, despite rising input costs as a result of weakness in the Sterling exchange rate. These factors are significant for the outlook where we expect both inflationary cost pressures and competition to intensify in the market as a whole. The rate of retail market sales growth may slow and the rate of profit growth that is achievable will be affected by margin pressure. And staff are going to be hit in the pocket, when the bosses decide how much of the profits to share with them. The Partnership Board will decide on the level of Bonus in March, but, given the challenging market outlook and the importance of investment for the future, the Board expects that bonus is likely to be significantly lower than last year. Boom! Shares in JD Sports have hit a new all-time high, romping up by 6% to 346p. That puts it top of the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies. Traders are applauding the firm\u2019s 10% jump in sales over Christmas And finally, here are those smaller retailers... Baby goods retailer Mothercare has reported a 1% jump in like-for-like sales in the last quarter, driven by online sales. More here. Fashion chain SuperGroup says it had a good half-year, with revenues rising to \u00a3334.0m, from \u00a3254.7m. More here. Top hat and tails purveyor Moss Bros has posted a 6% jump in like-for-like sales. CEO Brian Brick says \u201congoing investment in new and refitted stores\u201d is paying off. More here. Dunelm, the homewares firm, had a solid but unspectacular festive period with like-for-like sales up 0.2%. More here. No drama at food wholesale chain Booker Group; it\u2019s on track to hit City forecasts this year. Online fashion chain ASOS has reported bumper sales growth over Christmas, up 18% in the UK. International sales surged by 52%, as ASOS benefits from the weak pound, and the company is now planning to upgrade its systems and processes to handle higher demand. CEO Nick Beighton says: \u201cWith sales for the year now expected to be up by c.25 percent to 30 percent, we\u2019re accelerating our infrastructure investment to handle that growth.\u201d Tesco\u2019s shares have fallen by 2.3% in early trading. That making it the worst-performing member of the FTSE 100, even though it grew sales by 0.7% over Christmas. Tesco is holding a conference call now, and saying it\u2019s not seen any change in UK consumer spending since the EU referendum. John Ibbotson of Retail Vision argues that Tesco\u2019s results are encouraging: \u201cTesco\u2019s revival continues apace, with a strong Christmas trading period and third quarter.\u201dMore ominously for its competitors, Tesco has managed to increase its market share in a period of cut-throat competition. Shares in M&amp;S have jumped by almost 5% at the start of trading, as investors cheer its best festive performance for six years. That\u2019s makes it the best-performing share on the FTSE 100. My colleague Zoe Wood explains: Marks &amp; Spencer has ended the long-running slump in sales at is clothing arm with its best Christmas performance for six years. The retailer said like-for-like clothing sales were up by 2.3% in the 13 weeks to 31 December. This time last year clothing sales had slumped by nearly 6%. M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe said \u201cbetter ranges, better availability and better prices\u201d had helped it improve its performance in a difficult marketplace. To win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. He also slashed the number of promotions run by the store. More here: Online electricals retailer AO World has dampened the mood, despite decent sales growth over Christmas. AO says that it is cautious about trading conditions, due to \u201cthe uncertain UK economic outlook, currency impacts on supplier pricing and the possible effect on consumer demand\u201d On the upside, total revenues in the three months to December 31 were up 12.3% year-on-year. But that may not be enough to cheer investors. CEO John Roberts says: Looking ahead we have three months left of the current financial year and are mindful of the uncertain economic outlook. However, we remain confident that our market leading proposition will continue to drive customers to experience the AO Way and enter the New Year excited by the opportunities ahead.\u201d JD Sports has also reported strong sales and expects to beat City forecasts for profits in the current year. It said the like-for-like growth of about 10% achieved in the first half had continued in the second half of its financial year to 7 January. JD now expects that headline profit before tax and one-off items for the current financial year will exceed analysts\u2019 expectations of \u00a3200m by up to 15%. Peter Cowgill, executive chairman, said: \u201cWhilst we acknowledge that it would be unreasonable to expect like for like sales growth to be maintained at recent levels for a fifth consecutive year, we are confident that both domestically and internationally, our unique and often exclusive sports fashion premium brand offer provides a solid foundation for future development.\u201d The trading update did not mention the firm\u2019s investigation into conditions at its Kingsway warehouse near Rochdale after a Channel 4 documentary found workers claiming it was \u201cworse than a prison\u201d. City veteran David Buik reckons JD have outperformed Sports Direct. City commentators are fairly impressed with the results of Retail Super Thursday. Here\u2019s ITV\u2019s Chris Choi: The BBC\u2019s Dominic O\u2019Connell points out that M&amp;S\u2019s 2.3% jump in clothing/home sales are flattered by an extra week\u2019s trading - take that out, and it only grew by 0.8%. Still growth, though! The BBC\u2019s Emma Simpson flags up that Tesco is growing market share again, after a five-year haitus: Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon says the UK consumer seems to be in good spirits over Christmas: Associated British Foods, the firm behind the Primark chain, says that trading across its business was \u201cgood\u201d in the last 16 weeks. However, we don\u2019t have any like-for-like figures for Primark. Total sales at Primark were up 11% year-on-year in \u2018constant currency terms\u2019, or a chunky 22% in actual currency terms (thanks to the fall in sterling). ABF says: The UK performed well. Like-for-like sales for the period were good and market share increased reflecting the strength of our consumer offering. Like-for-like sales for the group were held back by declines, albeit smaller than last year, in Germany and the Netherlands, the latter particularly affected by the rapid increase in selling space. Onto Debenhams...and it\u2019s also beaten forecasts as customers clamoured for beauty products and gifts. My colleague Julia Kollewe has taken a look, and reports: Debenhams has reported better than expected Christmas trading. Like-for-like sales grew 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January and were up 1.7% at constant exchange rates. Over the 18 weeks to 7 January, group like-for-like sales at constant exchange rates edged up 0.5%, with UK sales stronger, at 1% growth. Analysts had expected a 1% drop in underlying sales. The retailer said beauty and gift sales grew strongly to take the non-clothing sales mix to 57%. It has cut back on promotions overall but said it had a successful Black Friday. Tesco has also posted a decent-looking performance over Christmas, with a 0.7% rise in like-for-like sales in the UK - driven by sales of toys and clothes. That\u2019s despite not repeating last year\u2019s loyalty card promotion which it said had hit performance by 0.8%. Here\u2019s the details: Food like-for-like sales up 1.3%, with significant market outperformance in fresh food Impact of minus 0.8% on total UK like-for-like sales from not repeating Clubcard \u2018Boost\u2019 promotion, leading to lower general merchandise sales Strong performance in clothing and toys, with sales up 4.3% and 8.5% respectively CEO Dave Lewis says this is Tesco\u2019s third successful Christmas in a row We are very encouraged by the sustained strong progress that we are making across the Group. In the UK, we saw our eighth consecutive quarter of volume growth and delivered a third successful Christmas. Our fresh food ranges proved particularly popular, outperforming the market with great quality, innovative new products and even more affordable prices. Internationally, we have continued to focus on improving our offer for customers in challenging market conditions. We are well-placed against the plans we shared in October to become more competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner for our suppliers, whilst creating long-term value for our shareholders. I would like to thank all of our colleagues for everything they have done to serve our customers brilliantly over this very busy period.\u201d Today\u2019s results are a boost to Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new CEO, Steve Rowe, who recently announced a turnaround plan for the business centered on its food business. Rowe says: \u201cI am pleased with the customer response we have seen to the changes we are making in line with our plan for the business. I would like to thank the whole team for their hard work over this busy period. \u201cIn Clothing &amp; Home, better ranges, better availability and better prices helped to improve our performance in a difficult marketplace. We also continued to substantially reduce discounting, including over Black Friday. \u201cOur Food business continues to grow market share with customers recognising our product as special and different. Our Simply Food store pipeline remains strong.\u201d Rowe warms, though, that consumer confidence remains \u201cuncertain\u201d in 2017. Marks &amp; Spencer has beaten City forecasts, with sales growth across its food, clothing and homeware operations. The high-street chain grew its like-for-like sales in the UK by 1.3%, led by a 2.3% jump in clothes and homeware. That\u2019s a welcome return to form for M&amp;S, after years of underperformance in this area. Food sales also did well, up 0.6% in a like-for-like basis (stripping out new stores). Here\u2019s the details: And we\u2019re off! A mass of trading news is flashing across the wires as all 12 retailers report their results to the City. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They\u2019re calling it Retail Super Thursday in the City. No fewer than 12 of Britain\u2019s shopping groups are reporting their financial results for the Christmas period this morning, giving a crucial insight into the UK economy. The list includes several big names -- Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Debenhams, along with JD Sports, SuperGroup, Mothercare, Associated British Foods (the owner of Primark), Moss Bros, ASOS, Booker Group, Dunelm, and AO.com. Veteran analyst Nick Bubb sighs: \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d is a nightmare for retail analysts with about a dozen Christmas trading announcements all coming out at once at 7am. But it\u2019s worth it, guys, to find out how Britain\u2019s high street and e-commerce sector fared during the first festive period since the Brexit vote. Also coming up.... There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from a report on German GDP in 2016 at 9am, eurozone industrial production figures at 10am, and the weekly US jobless report at 1.30pm. Plus, traders will be watching to see if the FTSE 100 can extend its run of record highs....",

The December rate, as measured on the consumer prices index (CPI), was the highest since July 2014 and higher than forecasts for 1.4% in a Reuters poll of economists. The increase fanned concerns about a squeeze on living standards this year and economists said inflation would continue to climb much higher, leaving households worse off in real terms. The worries stem from sterling\u2019s drop against other currencies since the vote to leave the EU last summer. A weaker pound has raised the costs of imports such as food and fuel, and businesses are starting to pass that on to consumers. The pound came under more pressure in recent days, dropping below $1.20 at one point, ahead of Theresa May\u2019s speech on the Brexit process. But it recovered markedly after she promised a vote in parliament on the Brexit deal. Conor D\u2019Arcy, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the latest inflation figures showed the ultra-low price rises that consumers have benefitted from in recent years were \u201cwell and truly over\u201d. \u201cIt will be years until we see the overall economic impact of Brexit, but the one dead cert in 2017 is rising inflation fuelled by a sharp fall in the pound. With nominal pay only expected to rise by 2.4% in 2017, the risk is we see a fresh pay squeeze with rising prices eating up all pay growth by the end of the year.\u201d The head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, Mike Prestwood, said that while inflation was higher in December it was still below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. \u201cRising airfares and food prices, along with petrol prices falling less than last December, all helped to push up the rate of inflation. Rising raw material costs also continued to push up the prices of goods leaving factories,\u201d he said. But the bigger-than-expected pick up in prices will make the Bank\u2019s task of setting interest rates tougher as it seeks to strike a balance between keeping inflation under control while providing enough support to jobs and economic growth. \u201cWith CPI inflation now within touching distance of the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, there will be mounting speculation that the Bank could raise rates,\u201d said Elizabeth Martins, economist at the bank HSBC. \u201cParticularly since today\u2019s release goes beyond just oil: food, clothing, air fares and accommodation inflation all pushed higher too. But as we forecast growth to slow, we expect rates to remain on hold despite higher inflation.\u201d The pound is down 17% against the dollar since the referendum, and the pressure on import costs has already sparked some high profile price tussles between suppliers and retailers, such as the row over Marmite last year. Apple said on Tuesday that it was raising prices on its UK app store by almost 25% to reflect sterling\u2019s sharp depreciation. The new prices will roll out over the next week, giving customers a short window to beat the price increase. Underscoring the pressures firms face, ONS figures published alongside the inflation update showed another rise in factory costs. The prices of imported materials and fuels were the largest driver, largely on the back of the pound\u2019s depreciation and a recovery in global oil prices as curde production is cut, statisticians said. Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 15.8% in December on a year ago, the biggest jump since September 2011. Factory gate prices rose 2.7%, their fastest annual rise since March 2012. Thanks to those sterling-related cost pressures and higher oil prices, some economists expect inflation to rise to around 3% this year. The Bank has said that rise would make life harder for consumers in 2017, as wages fail to keep pace with price rises, squeezing family budgets against a backdrop of slowing economic growth. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said lower-income families would suffer more. \u201cOne big driver of the increase is the rising cost of the weekly shop, which will have a bigger impact on people who are struggling to make ends meet,\u201d said Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the charity. \u201cPeople in the bottom fifth of the income scale typically spend \u00a31 in every \u00a36 on food, compared with \u00a31 in every \u00a312 for the richest fifth.\u201d Businesses are also bracing for tougher conditions. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said there was an \u201cever increasing squeeze on manufacturers from rising input costs\u201d. Its senior economist, George Nikolaidis, said: \u201cAny respite is unlikely during 2017 as increased input costs will continue to bite into profit margins in the year ahead.\u201d With the UK economy largely reliant on consumers to drive growth, the Treasury has sought to highlight its efforts to support household incomes, including a planned increase in the national living wage and a freeze on fuel duty. Commenting on the inflation figures, a spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government is committed to helping hard-working people keep more of what they earn and to supporting households with the cost of living.\u201d The TUC said people were going into this latest bout of Brexit uncertainty and inflation on a weak footing. \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week worse off than they were before the last financial crisis, and now rising prices are hitting their pay packets again,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. 10 things that went up between November and December Cooking oils and fats: up 5.1% (esp margarine) Bread and cereals: up 1.3% Vegetables: up 0.9% (esp cauliflowers ) Air fares: up 48.9%* Soft drinks and mineral water: up 1.4% Furniture and furnishings: up 2.6% Household appliances: up 1.9% (eg cookers, freezers, dishwashers) DIY materials: up 2% (eg tiles, wallpaper, paint) Pets and pet care: up 0.6% House contents insurance: up 1.2% * Air fares typically rise in December but in December 2016 they rose by more than in December 2015 Source: ONS",

                "bodyText":"The first day of the World Economic Forum is nearly over, so we\u2019re going to take a break. I\u2019ll be back if there are any major developments - in the meantime, here\u2019s our news story on president Xi\u2019s visit: Columbian singer Shakira, who collected a WEF Crystal Award last night, has been discussing her work building schools in the most downtrodden parts of the country: \u201cSometimes we encounter a tremendous lack of infrastructure. No portable water in many cases, no electricity, no paved roads, so it definitely means that we have to work twice as hard in order to offer a quality education.\u201d Not only that, but many of the children concerned are affected by violence or have lost family members. John Kerry also urged Europe to \u201cbelieve in itself\u201d, and remember that European integration was driven by the need to stop European\u2019s killing each other. \u201cIt\u2019s worked, folks!, said Kerry, adding: \u201cOn the face of the planet, no assembly of countries has grown as significantly and powerfully as Europe. Away from Davos again, and European markets have closed for the day, with the UK the focus of attention. A positive reaction to UK prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech, notably the promise that parliament would be able to vote on any deal with the U, helped push the pound almost 3% higher, its biggest daily rise since 1998. Sterling was already edging higher before the speech, recovering some ground after the government\u2019s hard Brexit suggestions at the weekend. A weak US dollar as Donald Trump said the American currency was overvalued helped here, as did stronger than expected UK inflation figures which suggested the next move in UK interest rates would be upwards. The jump in the pound, conversely, knocked back the FTSE 100, which recorded its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last June. The FTSE 100 has been boosted for several months by the fall in the pound, which helps the overseas earners and exporters which dominate the leading index. So the rise in sterling - which is currently 2.8% higher against the dollar at $1.2382 and up 1.87% against the euro at \u20ac1.1577 - has had the opposite effect, and the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.46% to 7220.38. European markets have edged lower, with Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.13% and France\u2019s Cac closing 0.46% lower. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 29 points or 0.15%. President Xi\u2019s trip to Switzerland is already making headlines: John Kerry, the outgoing US secretary of state, has cited the Iran nuclear deal as proof that engaging with other nations to deliver peace can pay off. On his final trip to Europe before leaving office, Kerry told Davos that the Iran deal was one of the successes of the Obama presidency, and proof that diplomacy works. Kerry says: There are now no longer 19,000 centrifuges spinning and enriching, there are 5,000, which is the agreement. There is no longer a 12,000 kg stockpile that could produce 10 to 12 bombs. There\u2019s 300kg, measurable every day. And you can\u2019t build a bomb with 300kg. This is an agreement that can endure, he adds. Donald Trump has criticised the Iran deal, raising concerns that it could unravel. Kerry, though, insists it can last. Take Iran. If the United States were to decide suddenly that we\u2019re not going to pursue this, I bet you that our friends and allies who negotiated this with us will get together, and Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain will say \u2018this is a good deal, we\u2019re going to keep it. And we\u2019ll have done a great injury to ourselves. And it will hurt for a year, two years, while the administration is there  . Kerry also cites the Paris climate change agreement, progress towards ending the war in Yemen, as reasons to be optimistic about the future. And he say he won\u2019t guess whether Trump really believes some of the things he\u2019s said in the race for the White House. Hollywood Matt Damon is talking to the press about his Water.org charity, and the challenges in raising money. Water.org wants to guarantee clean water for everyone in the world; a great goal, but one which hasn\u2019t been easy to attract funding. Damon says: We\u2019ve tried humour -- a few years ago I went on a toilet strike for an entire year. One of the first hurdles we\u2019ve had to clear in the West is that it\u2019s very hard for people to relate to this issue. If you grew up in Europe, if you grew up in America, you\u2019ve never been thirsty in your entire life and you\u2019ve never been five metres away from a clean drink water. The water in our toilet is cleaner than the water that 663m people have access to. Damon adds that he has very high hopes for a partnership with Stella Artois, the brewer. This will mean extra funding for Water.org, which provides affortable micro-loans to help communities install clean water equipment. You can go into a pub in the UK or America and buy a pint of Stella, and for that one pint of Stella, they will guarantee bringing someone in the developing world clean water for a month. S&amp;P\u2019s Paul Sheard also believes President Xi genuinely wants to avoid a trade war (one of the key points of his pro-gobalisation speech this morning). Sheard explains that China would come off worse than America if globalisation and free trade falters. If you did go into a trade ice age, who would be better placed to survive it, economically? I think the answer is the US, because the US is a very large economy, resource rich, with a very large population. Smaller export-driven countries such as Mexico would obviously suffer more, while China (although a huge economy) is still in the development phase. China has got more to lose in terms of making sure that process of economic development continues than the US would. That doesn\u2019t make it a good thing to go that way, but just in terms of the relative economic costs, it would be higher. But.... a one-party state like China is in a better state to survive the political consequences of a trade war, while President Trump could suffer an electoral backlash. Sheard says: It\u2019s not clear that Trump has the upper hand. You\u2019ve got the mid-terms in two years. If it\u2019s like \u2018oh my god this guy screwed up\u2019, he\u2019s on a short fuse. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P, says Anthony Scaramucci is on a one-man mission to explain Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies to Davos this week. Speaking to me at Davos, Sheard explains: Scaramucci went a long way at this meeting to clarifying, probably for many people, what the basic intent of the Trump administration is likely to be. Trump\u2019s been talking about free - he\u2019s a big supporter of free trade - but he also wants to be fair trade. That means \u201cWe\u2019ll open to you, but you\u2019ve got to open to us. As we covered earlier, Scaramucci insisted that the US is committed to free trade - but wants more \u201csymmetry\u201d (rather than letting the other country get the best of the deal). The FT\u2019s Gillian Tett has a good write-up here: Away from Davos for a moment, and Wall Street has opened lower after president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s comments that the dollar was overvalued knocked the US currency lower. In turn, a falling greenback plus higher than expected UK inflation and a positive response to prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech - notably the line that parliament will be able to vote on any deal - has boosted the pound and pushed the FTSE 100 lower. The index is full of dollar earners who have benefited from the weak pound in recent months but are now heading lower as sterling strengthens. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned after the Martin Luther King day break with a 62 point or 0.33% decline. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 1% at 7247, on track for its biggest one day fall since November, while European markets have also edged lower. As for the pound, it is currently 2.6% higher and on track for its best daily performance since December 2008. IHS Markit chief economist Dr Nariman Behravesh agrees that president Xi\u2019s speech on globalisation and free trade was \u201cvery encouraging\u201d; but the real test is whether he delivers on it. President Xi gave a very rigorous and articulate defence of globalisation. Essentially, he said that we should not blame all the world\u2019s problems on globalisation and that the benefits outweigh the costs. Very importantly, he made commitments about opening China up to more imports and foreign direct investment and making sure that China\u2019s exchange rate policy didn\u2019t destabilize the global economy. All this is very encouraging. However, actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what China does. This is a good start. This is a good set of commitments on his part. It is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is. Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci is speaking again \u2013 and insisting that the next US government doesn\u2019t want a trade war either. Scaramucci says the president-elect wants a very strong relationship with China: Scaramucci also talking in desperately glowing terms about how Donald Trump won the US election, and why he joined the Trump campaign. Scaramucci says he realised that Trump was on to something after he met with visitors to a rally. The common thread was that they were on government assistance because factories had been closed. Scaramucci says: And I started going through the crowd, and I thought \u2018oh my god, these are the people I grew up with\u2019. The \u201cgreat irony of this story\u201d is that it was a billionaire real estate developer who picked up on these concerns and offered solutions, Scaramucci adds. Scaramucci claims there\u2019s only one (!) negative with Trump \u2013 he\u2019s always on the go. I don\u2019t know when he sleeps.... We need to outwork him, and it\u2019s not possible. He criticises the media for assuming that Trump\u2019s huge rallies wouldn\u2019t actually translate into votes on election day. If someone is willing to wait in the rain for eight hours outside an arena, do you think they\u2019re not going to show up and vote? On other politicians, Scaramucci says the president-elect has \u201ca tremendous amount of respect for chancellor Merkel, and president Putin\u201d. Scaramucci insist that Trump isn\u2019t at all racist (despite his comments about Mexicans, muslims and immigrants during the campaign - and that barney with the respected civil rights leader John Lewis last week). But what about the big issue of Nato? Does Trump really think it\u2019s obsolete? Scaramucci says the alliance needs radical reforms to adjust to today\u2019s political climate; comments that may not reassure the Baltic states. Environmental campaigners have welcomed President Xi\u2019s call for leaders to stick with the Paris Climate Change deal. Here\u2019s Li Shuo, Senior Global Policy Advisor at Greenpeace East Asia: \u201cGiven the current volatility of global politics, President Xi Jinping\u2019s address today in Davos helped calm nerves. His reference to climate change highlights a growing sense of China\u2019s international responsibility, and the country\u2019s evolving calculus towards taking action on the issue. \u201cAs Mr. Trump drops President Obama\u2019s climate legacy, Mr. Xi might well establish one of his own. 2017 presents a real opportunity for China to rise to the challenge of responsible climate leadership. Having moved from climate villain to a reluctant leader in five short years over the first half of this decade, it\u2019s reasonable to expect China to become a true leader by its end.\u201d The global elite who gather at Davos each January have waited more than 40 years for a Chinese president to address them. And Xi Jinping was worth the wait, delivering a rollicking defence of globalisation that would have been unthinkable from a Chinese leader in the past. While the hall was packed out with business leaders and politicians, many of Xi\u2019s remarks were aimed at one person who certainly isn\u2019t at Davos - Donald Trump. The key moment was probably when Xi insisted that a trade war would be in no-one\u2019s interests, and dismissed protectionism as simply locking oneself in a dark room. His pointed reminders about the strength of the Chinese economy - all those tourists, all that trade - were another jibe at those who think world trade has gone too far. And by stoutly defending globalisation, Xi is hoping that other world leaders might be on his side if relations with Washington deteriorate. The speech definitely went down well in Davos, and beyond: Of course; these speeches are often notable for what\u2019s missing; Xi didn\u2019t talk about Chinese dumping of steel on European markets, the Great Firewall preventing citizens getting full access to the Internet. And his talk about staying resolute in stormy seas won\u2019t comfort those in the west losing their jobs, either to automation or free trade. Experienced China-watched George Magnus, former chief economist of UBS, isn\u2019t convinced that the president will live up to the vision he laid out today. But still -- a speech to remember, not least because who gave it; 2017 is going to be another year to remember. China\u2019s president Xi may have played to a packed house at Davos, but there was another key player on delegates\u2019 minds - and apparently Xi\u2019s too - while not even being there. That person of course is Donald Trump. Larry Elliott writes: Hamlet without the prince. That, bluntly, is how Davos feels this year. The usual caravan of business leaders, academics, clerics, journalists and celebs has trekked up into the high Alps for their annual January get-together but the man everyone is talking about is 3,000 miles away awaiting his inauguration in Washington later this week. Donald Trump is dominating proceedings. The survey of business executives conducted by PwC showed that companies are worried by Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric. Predictably, the concerns are strongest in the US and Mexico given what the president-elect has said about building a wall along the Rio Grande. But Trump\u2019s influence can be felt in other ways. The manner in which he won the US election, tapping in to deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution of the spoils of economic growth, has been noted. There is talk in Davos of the need to ensure that globalisation works for everyone. Larry\u2019s full piece is here: President Xi sums up with a call for world leaders to stick with globalisation. When encountering trouble we should not blame others, or run away, he declares, adding: History is created by the brave - let us boost confidence, take action, and work together for a bright future. And that\u2019s it! WEF founder Klaus Schwab thanks Xi for bringing some sunshine to Davos; I\u2019ll pull together some more reaction now.... In conclusion, Xi says that China\u2019s economy is now entering a \u2018new normal\u2019 (after many years of double-digit growth). We have 1.3 billion people, and their living standards are not yet high. The aim is to achieve \u201cmedium to high\u201d level growth, and move the economy to the higher end of the supply chain. Xi talks about the need to strengthen property rights in China, and make its economy better regulated. And then he drops some loud hints that the world economy needs China. Over the coming five years, China expects to import $8 trillion of US goods and make $750bn of outbound investment, and Chinese tourists will make 700m visits overseas. Xi declares: China will keep its door wide open, and not close it. And we hope that other countries will keep their doors open, and maintain a level playing field, Xi adds -- another nudge at president-elect Trump. And Xi promises that he won\u2019t launch a currency war, or devalue the yuan. Xi urges leaders in Davos not to abandon the historic climate change agreed in Paris in December 2015: Xi now turns to China\u2019s own progress, saying its \u201cpeople-oriented philosophy\u201d has lifted 700 million people out of poverty. \u201cAll roads lead to Rome\u201d, he declares, but that doesn\u2019t mean that what works for one country works for another. Piling ever more cliches on his audience, Xi says China knows there is no such thing as a free lunch, and no \u201cpie will fall from the sky\u201d. He\u2019s now explaining that China\u2019s moves to opening its economy has been a boost to the whole global economy; and the country isn\u2019t jealous of other people\u2019s success (which I think is a nudge to other leaders not to blame Beijing for their ills). A ripple of applause rings out across the conference hall as president Xi declares that \u201cno-one will emerge as a winner in a trade war\u201d. In remarks that could well be aimed at president-elect Trump, Xi he tells WEF that global leaders must push for open and willing cooperation\u201d, rather than nipping back to the harbour every time there is a storm. Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. Wind and rain may be kept outside, but so is light and air. Xi now turns to \u201cworrying\u201d levels of economic inequality. One percent of the population control as much wealth as the remaining 99%, he says; The fundamental problem facing the global economy is the lack of a driving force for growth. We must relentlessly pursue innovation, to find ways to push growth rates up. Xi now turns to the problems in the global economy,. The path to sustainable solid growth remains elusive, he says, and then singles out \u201cinadequate\u201d governance in the financial markets. Trade and investment rules has not kept pace with other developments, he warns: Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you can\u2019t escape from, Xi continues. Any attempt to cut off the glow of capital, goods, and people between economies and channel the waters into the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible. Ina speech ripe with analogies, Xi declares that China\u2019s move towards open markets has been choppy -- with plenty of whirlpools and choking along the way. But we have learned to survive, and we must have the courage to keep swimming in the global market. The financial crisis was caused by \u201cchasing profits\u201d and failed regulation, not globalisation, says Xi. The voices attacking globalisation have laid bare the pitfalls facing globalisation, and we need to take this seriously, the Chinese president continues. Xi quotes a Chinese proverb that \u201cHoney melons hang from bitter vines\u201d. Nothing is perfect in this world, he continues. President Xi he insists that there is \u201cno point\u201d blaming globalisation for all the problems facing the world. He cites the flow of refugees from the Middle East and Africa - a global concern, but not one caused by opening up markets. War, conflict and regional turmoil that have caused these problems, says Xi. The solution is in promising peace and restoring stability. President Xi begins his speech by quoting Charles Dickens -- and his famous line that \u201cIt was the best of time, it was the worst of times\u201d. We live in a time of incredible change, Xi tells Davos. We face global challenges like terrorism and refugees. Many people are wondering - what has gone wrong with our world? Economic globalisation was once seen as the treasure in the cave found by Ali Baba -- now it is seen as Pandora\u2019s box, he continues. And we\u2019re off! Here\u2019s a live feed of president Xi\u2019s speech: WEF founder Klaus Schwab is giving president Xi Jinping a typically effusive welcome, congratulating the Chinese leader for his country\u2019s growth record and hailing his leadership on issues such as climate change. No mention of human rights issues or internet censorship, mind you... There\u2019s a massive buzz across the World Economic Forum right now, as we wait to hear from president Xi Jinping. The main hall is absolutely packed --- they\u2019re turning people away at the door --such is the interest in the first Chinese president to address WEF. Anthony Scaramucci has told ITV News that Britain will be at the \u2018front of the line\u2019 for a trade deal, reversing president Obama\u2019s \u2018back of the queue\u2019 warning before June\u2019s vote. Anthony Scaramucci, one of Donald Trump\u2019s top advisors, is making some fascinating comments about monetary policy here in Davos. Scaramucci is arguing that only 3% of the world population benefitted from unorthodox monetary policy such as quantitative easing, leaving the other 97% behind: \u201cA global crisis forced a massive monetary intervention. It was a success but a by-product was asset reflation. 97% of global citizens did not get an uplift.\u201d [central banks used QE to buy up government bonds, which pushed up asset prices as banks invested in riskier things] Scaramucci said he was from a working class family but didn\u2019t see the current system delivering for aspirational Americans. Politicians need to reconnect with the rest of the population, and find economic policies that benefit them too, he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that anymore. The top 3% are back where they were in 2007. The other 97% are struggling. We\u2019ve got to listen to the people.\u201d Scaramucci also argues that Trump could be followed by a left-wing president in 2020, if he doesn\u2019t make the situation better. That\u2019s music to Bernie Sanders supporters\u2019 ears.... Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, said: Inflation is back with a vengeance. The weakening pound continues to drive prices higher and today\u2019s CPI reading of 1.6% on the back of rising fuel, food and air fares is significantly higher than expected. With more hints from the UK Government that a hard Brexit is on the cards, we could see sterling fall even further in the lead up to the Prime Minister pulling the trigger on Article 50. This will translate into further inflation in the short term. Indeed, some of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers have already warned that they may have to raise prices as they are forced to pass on higher costs of importing goods from abroad to customers. A rise in UK interest rates is in prospect as inflation rises, says Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade: Although inflation hitting a two-year high is a sign of a strong economy, and those on the other side of The Channel would hope for some of the same, today\u2019s CPI data could sound alarm bells for the Bank of England. The pound is shaking amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and consumer spending, which has proved vital in helping the economy recover from June\u2019s referendum, is likely to dry up. Inflation could rise as high as 3% this year, surely leaving Mark Carney and the BoE considering an interest rate hike. The inflation figure is the highest level since mid-2014, with higher air fares and the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote fuelling the price rises. Food prices were higher after the sterling slump (remember Marmitegate?) and there was also a smaller fall in petrol prices than in December 2015, following the recovery in the crude price since then. The move pushes inflation closer to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. In November the Bank forecast it would exceed 2.7% by the end of this year as the pound\u2019s slump pushes up the price of imports, and these figures are showing signs of that effect. NF Breaking news: UK inflation came in higher than expected in December, with the Bank of England\u2019s preferred CPI measurement up 1.6% compared to 1.2% in the previous month and expectations of 1.4%. The chairman of HSBC has criticised those who argue that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote was a vote for free trade. Speaking in Davos this morning, Douglas Flint was asked whether voters in the North of England were voting for free trade when they ticked the \u201cNo\u201d box in last June\u2019s referendum, as some Brexiteers have argued. Flint dismissed the idea as \u201cextraordinary\u201d: No, I think they were voting to leave the EU. I think the interpretation of the vote is extraordinary, just as it is in the US as well. People can have theories, but at the end of the day certainly in relation to Brexit there was a single question on the voting slip and that\u2019s what people voted for. They voted to leave Europe, whatever was in their minds that caused them to vote that way is up to them. The priority now is to implement Brexit, in as painless a way as possible, Flint continued. Lot of people can have theories, usually backing up their own perception....but we\u2019ve had a vote, and we\u2019re now in the implementation phase, of what does that mean and how to you execute it in a way that does the least harm to the EU 27 and the UK and can be completed as efficiently and quickly as possible. Flint says that HSBC is now doing a \u201chuge amount of work\u201d helping clients understand what Brexit means. Their supply chains may be \u2018longer and clunkier\u2019 than before, and revenue may take longer to flow through. The \u201creal challenge\u201d is helping small and medium-sized forms who haven\u2019t had to think about these issues for the last 40 years, as they were part of the single market. Flint reminded his audience that the City had coped extremely well with the turbulence in the markets after June 23; that\u2019s a reason not to fragment London\u2019s financial system. Very few financial systems in the world that could cope with that event, there was so much volatility, and nothing broke, Flint said. What exists in London today is the aggregation of decades of experience, risk management, and so forth, he added. Fragmenting that across New York, Singapore, etc would go against efforts to reduce risks in the financial sector. Flint also warned that Europe\u2019s economy could suffer if the Brexit deal hurts the City: One of the dangers is that the aggregate supply of financial capacity to the economy of Europe drops in two years time, which would not be consistent with trying to grow the economy. One of the attendees at Davos is the head of the world\u2019s biggest fund manager Blackrock, which has been making headlines in the financial world by attacking executive pay and becoming the largest shareholder in Lloyds Banking Group. Jill Treanor has the background: Among the 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists and celebrities attending this year\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos will be a 64-year-old with receding hair and rimless glasses. The academic demeanour of Larry Fink belies his role running BlackRock, an outfit he founded 30 years ago and which has become the biggest fund manager on the planet, overseeing $5.1tn (\u00a34.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers. The sheer size of the operation \u2013 the UK economy is worth \u00a31.8tn \u2013 puts Fink at the helm of an international powerhouse, with tentacles across markets for stocks and bonds around the globe. In the UK alone, BlackRock is usually found among the top three shareholders in FTSE 100 blue-chip companies. Last week it pipped the UK government to become the biggest investor in Lloyds Banking Group. While Fink makes regular appearances at major events such as Davos \u2013 this year he is to opine on the global economy \u2013 BlackRock is not known for its public pronouncements. It does not provide specific detail on its shareholdings in each company or offer opinions on individual investments. However, there are signs that it may be about to become more vocal in public after its UK arm fired off a letter to the boards of the biggest 350 companies listed in London to urge them to rein in executive pay. Jill\u2019s full piece is here: Perhaps Davos 2018 should have more hairdressers and fewer politicians, based on this research: Political scientist Ian Bremmer is also tweeting some good stuff about the changes coming up in the world of work: We just caught up with John Nelson, chairman of Lloyd\u2019s of London, about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Nelson was a \u201cremainer\u201d but says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had all the arguments about the various options. We are leaving. We\u2019ve got to get used to it. Let\u2019s get cracking. The sooner we get negotiations going the better. We need decisions at the top.\u201d Nelson said the signs ahead of Theresa May\u2019s speech were that the UK would not have access to the single market after Brexit, and the City would lose the passporting rights that allow staff to work across the EU. \u201cWe need to make the best of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to discriminate against the UK as a punishment. It is in everyone\u2019s interests to have as much free trade as possible. But I don\u2019t expect a special deal.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s is setting up a European subsidiary to get round the passporting issue. The location of the office will be announced in the next three months, Nelson said. Nelson also had mixed feelings about the arrival in the White House of Donald Trump. He expressed concern about the president elect\u2019s views on climate change - a key issue for the insurance industry - but thinks Trump could stimulate growth. \u201cClimate change is a long-term problem. Our concern is that Trump will reverse the slow progress that has been make. It will put humanity at risk if we continue to blow carbon into the air.\u201d Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has been predicting tense times in the world\u2019s government bond markets, once Donald Trump gets his hands on the keys to the White House: Theresa May\u2019s upcoming speech on Britain\u2019s exit strategy is the talk of Davos this morning. Yesterday\u2019s reports that the UK PM will announce the UK will leave the single market has disappointed those hoping for a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019. Two delegates arriving at the swanky Steigenberger Grandhotel Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re for breakfast meetings captured the mood. Delegate 1: How are you today? Delegate 2: Oh, I\u2019m very calm D1: Why are you calm? D2: Because the world is coming to an end today. D1: Ah yes, it is today with Theresa Maybe\u2019s speech.... It\u2019s a chilly minus 13 degrees Celsius in Davos this morning, and some of the pavements are a little treacherous, but at least it\u2019s not snowing. Here\u2019s Facebook\u2019s WEF HQ - which the Daily Mail says was built specially for the occasion. Good morning from Davos, where the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Once again world leaders, top business people, economists, academics and the media have descended on this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world and hammer out deals. Much is the same as usual - from the bustling high-powered CEOs to the armed police on the streets. But this year\u2019s WEF is different; taking place under the twin shadows of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and the Brexit vote, and the broader tide of populism. Last night, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told the assembled throng that they must \u201cprioritise\u201d the public social good, over their own interests. \u201cSometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. But we have to look in a confident way into the future.\u201d This morning we\u2019ll get an insight into the new world order, when Chinese president Xi Jinping formally opens WEF. Xi is expected to make a powerful defence of globalisation, and pitch China as a country that could fill the void if Trump tries to take America way from free trade. Quartz has a good take this morning: Xi will defend trade and make a pitch for China to step into the leadership void left by a more-protectionist US under president Trump. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on @realDonaldTrump, to see if the US president-elect tries to steal the Chinese president\u2019s thunder with a trademark early-morning tweetstorm. One of Trump\u2019s key advisers, Anthony Scaramucci, is also taking the stage today to discuss where the US economy is heading. That could give some crucial insights into the Trump camp\u2019s thinking. There\u2019s also masses of other meetings, covering issues such as the 4th Industrial Revolution, equality and climate change, a speech by outgoing secretary of state John Kerry, and Hollywood star Matt Damon with his water.org charity. 11am Davos time/10am GMT: Xi Jinping speech 1pm/noon GMT: Anthony Scaramucci on the Outlook for the United States 3.15pm/2.15pm GMT: John Kerry on \u2018diplomacy in an era of disruption\u2019. We\u2019ll be tracking all the key events in Davos today, and trying to explain what it means for the world economy.",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019.</p> <p>This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter...</p> <p>In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on.

A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that.</p> <p><em>On the customs union:</em></p> <p>Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK.</p> <p><em>On globalisation:</em></p> <p> I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone.</p> <p><em>On the pound\u2019s weakness:</em></p> <p>Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p><em>And on technology and jobs:</em></p> <p>Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. <br></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-19/may-tells-banks-she-values-them-as-they-pack-their-brexit-bags\">Bloomberg\u2019s write-up</a> of the interview.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T17:20:15.585Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5880f01ee4b00b8fc2ae2666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:59:15.534Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes people feel globalization has &quot;left them behind,&quot; Theresa May says <a href=\"https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN\">https://t.co/jxcyEyT6iN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5NaC9Y37cx\">pic.twitter.com/5NaC9Y37cx</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/822124970235101185\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5880ece5e4b0f0efb00f5cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nickfletcher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-19T16:54:45.388Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve had &quot;positive discussions&quot; with big banks about jobs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal\">@bbckamal</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/davos2017?src=hash\">#davos2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd\">https://t.co/5O9EHYT7rd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FUjE1fEKMs\">pic.twitter.com/FUjE1fEKMs</a></p>&mdash; BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/822124355853258752\">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p>Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy.</p> <p>She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/822122563610480642\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most of what UK PM May said in that BTV interview has already been discounted...

The first was to convince UK business leaders they had a plan, an objective largely achieved even among those that think tough times lie ahead. The second was to smooth things over with businesses and politicians in the rest of Europe, which has been far less successful. May and Hammond seem oblivious to the current level of hostility towards the UK.</p> <p>Nor is the May-Hammond \u201ciron fist in the velvet glove\u201d routine likely to make the rest of Europe soften its hard line in the negotiations. Why?

                "bodyText":"Here are some of the key quotes from George Soros, for those who missed his interview here in Davos tonight (delegates are now polishing off the pudding and wine in the Seehof Hotel) In my opinion is is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament.And I think she will not last. At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted, and they live in hope.But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they\u2019ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won\u2019t rise as fast as the cost of living. The divorce is going to take a very long time. Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning. Hmmmm, maybe George. And on Europe, the billionaire who broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday said: \u201cOne has to recognize that the European Union has become too complicated and people are alienated. The anti-European parties are gathering force.\u201d And that\u2019s all from Davos. Goodnight!! GW Soros also took a swipe at Hungary\u2019s government, which is threatening to crack down on the non-government agencies he funds. He reads out a statement, saying that these threats against civil society are an affront to European values. Before anyone mistakes George Soros for Cassandra, lets remember that he predicted a year ago that Europe would disintegrate. He now says it won\u2019t - because neither Vladimir Putin nor China want it to fail. This session is being streamed live on Bloomberg TV, for anyone who hasn\u2019t made it to the Seehof hotel in Davos. Soros is taking questions from the room now -- and accepting them by email too, at sorosdavos2017@gmail.com Onto China....and Soros says Beijing would have no choice but to retaliate if Donald Trump labelled it a currency manipulator. It\u2019s much harder to get divorced than to get married, Soros continues, explaining why the Brexit process will take a long time. And he even suggests that Britain could quit the EU on a Friday, and rejoin on the Monday (!) George Soros now declares that it is unlikely that prime minister Theresa May will remain in power for long. She has already got a divided cabinet and a small majority in parliament....I think she will not last, Soros tells his audience of Davos delegates. The people in the UK are in denial, Soros continues. The current economic situation is not as bad as expected, so they live in hope, but as the currency depreciates, inflation will lead to a decline in living standards. It will take time, but when it happens they will realise they are not as well off as before, Soros concludes. If Europe breaks down, the consequences will be very dire, Soros concludes. And currently it is going in the wrong direction. Q: How will Brexit play out? I hope that both sides realise they must find some common ground. A bitter divorce would hurt both sides - And the divorce will be a long process. But when people realise they are going in the wrong direction, they will come together. Soros cites the Guardian\u2019s recent story that Michel Barnier was pushing for a special deal for the City. Last year was a disaster for Europe, Soros continues, with the Brexit vote and the Italian election. Europe has become too complicated, and people are alienated - the anti-European parties are gathering force and the future looks very bleak Hello again from the Seehof hotel in Davos, where veteran billionaire investor/philantropist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. On Donald Trump, Soros says he has described Trump as an imposter, a conman and a would-be dictator. But he is confident that the constitution of the US and division of power will hold sway. He would be a dictator if he could get away with it..but he won\u2019t. When Trump oversteps the mark, they will fight back, Soros predicts. He believes that Trump was surprised to win the November election.....he was engaged in building his brand and his success in attracting crowds. Soros says he\u2019s convinced that Trump will fail - not because people want him to, but because the ideas that drive him are essentially contradictory. For example, he has three chiefs of staff instead of one, and there will be tensions within his cabinet - meaning a lot of infighting in future. And that means that the markets won\u2019t maintain recent gains, Soros predicts: Right now, uncertainty is at its peak, and uncertainty is the enemy of long-term investment. It\u2019s all winding down in the WEF conference centre now; but we\u2019ll hoping to cover an interview/dinner with George Soros at around 8.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT) Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish comments at the latest European Central Bank meeting sent the euro lower and also helped push European markets marginally into the red. And with the dollar also weaker against the pound, the FTSE 100 also fell back - unsurprising given much of its recent gains have been due to the weakness of sterling boosting overseas earners. After Theresa May at Davos and Draghi at the ECB, investors are now awaiting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday with some nervousness. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the [European] central bank predictably keeping rates on hold attention turned to Draghi\u2019s statement and subsequent Q&amp;A. The Italian struck a more dovish tone than was expected, dismissing the Eurozone\u2019s recent CPI growth, arguing that \u2018there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation\u2019, while stating that the ECB stands \u2018ready to increase [its] asset purchases in size and duration if necessary\u2019. This was exactly what the euro didn\u2019t want to hear, causing the currency to shed 0.7% against both the dollar and the pound, leaving it at a 10 day low against the latter... In the UK the pound\u2019s gains, though less robust against the dollar than they were in the immediate aftermath of Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech, continued to suppress the FTSE, the index dropping by just shy of half a percent as the day went on. The FTSE wasn\u2019t helped by the sharp declines seen by its key commodity stocks, as well as the substantial 5% drop incurred by Royal Mail following its disappointing third quarter report this morning. Ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration tomorrow the Dow Jones was relatively subdued, trickling 0.2% lower after the bell. As for the day\u2019s data, the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashed expectations at 23.6, the highest reading in 2 and a half years, while at 234,000 jobless claims once again neared a 43 year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.54% at 7208.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 11,596.89 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.25% lower at 4841.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 51 points or 0.16%. As for the pound, it is up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.2311 and up 0.52% against the euro at \u20ac1.1590. Here\u2019s part of the transcript of Theresa May\u2019s interview with Bloomberg TV. On bank jobs leaving London: Well I\u2019ve had positive meetings with bank CEOs here and also with CEOs from tech companies and others and the message I\u2019ve brought here to Davos is that Britain outside of the European Union, we want to build a truly global Britain. A Britain that is an advocate for free trade, for free markets around the world and a Britain that is ensuring that we are taking those opportunities. I want to negotiate a good free trade agreement with the European Union when we come out, I want the best possible access for trading with and operating within the European single market, for both goods and services. I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe will do just that. On the customs union: Well a customs union of course is a separate issue from the free trade agreement. And what I want to see is as frictionless a border as possible. I do want to be able, for the UK to be able, to negotiate free trade deals around the rest of the world. We already have countries, I mean earlier today Australia has re-iterated its commitment to a free trade deal with the United Kingdom. We have countries around the world who want to talk to us about this, we\u2019ve already started talking to many about free trade agreements. So we want to look globally, not just to the EU but out around the whole world: a truly global Britain, bringing prosperity and jobs to the UK. On globalisation: I think what\u2019s important is that those of us who believe, as I do, in free trade, in free markets, in globalisation, it\u2019s important that we recognise that for some people that this has left them, has passed them by. That they\u2019re just getting by rather than getting on and so it is important and I\u2019ve said this right from the very beginning of my time as prime minister, that I want a country and an economy that works for everyone. One of the things we\u2019ll be doing in the UK is introducing a modern industrial strategy that\u2019s about the economy of the future, it\u2019s about ensuring that business can grow and is encouraged to grow in the UK, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that the benefits of prosperity are available across the whole country, we see that economic growth and prosperity for everyone. On the pound\u2019s weakness: Well, we\u2019ve seen different movements in the pound over the last six months, but what we\u2019ve also seen, through the other economic data that we\u2019ve seen, is the strength of the UK economy. You know, the IMF has made the point, we were last year the fastest growing major economy \u2013 only this week we had good figures which showed unemployment coming down once again. So we see a fundamental strength in the UK economy. I believe that\u2019s a good strength, I believe it\u2019s an economy that people want to invest in, and in fact, since the Brexit vote, we\u2019ve seen major companies like Nissan, like Google, Facebook actually making investments. SoftBank taking over Arm in the UK, making very significant investments here in the United Kingdom. And on technology and jobs: Well I think it\u2019s interesting if you look at technology, and of course technology is changing the workplace, but also technology creates jobs, and often creates jobs in areas that are unexpected. So it isn\u2019t quite a zero-sum game in that sense. But I think what people feel very often is that sometimes they see people playing by \u2013 appearing to play by a different set of rules. Sometimes there are some companies, the behaviour of which, or perhaps individuals within them, suggests to the public that actually there\u2019s one set of rules for those people and another set for ordinary hardworking families. I want to show that business is responsible, that people are playing by the same rules, and that together we can grow, that we can develop that prosperity that will be good for everyone. And here is Bloomberg\u2019s write-up of the interview. Theresa May also returned to the theme of globalisation, and commented on how technology was changing the workplace. Theresa May has been speaking on TV at Davos, and has told the BBC that she has had positive discussions with banks about the benefits of the City of London, and how to build on that for the future. This comment comes of course as banks continue to suggest they will move employees out of London as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. Asked about the weakness in sterling on Bloomberg TV, she did not want to get into a discussion about the value of the pound but pointed to economic data showing the fundamental strength of the UK economy. She also repeated that the UK had already begun discussions with other countries about free trade deals. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reckons that European leaders won\u2019t be scared by Philip Hammond\u2019s threat to slash taxes and regulation if Britain doesn\u2019t get a good Brexit deal. May and Hammond had two aims in Davos. The first was to convince UK business leaders they had a plan, an objective largely achieved even among those that think tough times lie ahead. The second was to smooth things over with businesses and politicians in the rest of Europe, which has been far less successful. May and Hammond seem oblivious to the current level of hostility towards the UK. Nor is the May-Hammond \u201ciron fist in the velvet glove\u201d routine likely to make the rest of Europe soften its hard line in the negotiations. Why? Because there is an obvious inconsistency in the prime minister calling for a bigger role for the state to ensure globalisation works for those who voted for Brexit; and the chancellor saying that if the worst came to the worst Britain could slash taxes, have a bonfire of regulations and be western Europe\u2019s Hong Kong. The EU 27 will see scorched earth as an empty threat. Which it is. Here\u2019s his full analysis: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the new head of the United Nations, has singled out youth unemployment as a major threat to global security. In a keynote speech, Guterres says that: The scourge of youth unemployment is probably the worst problem we are facing today, with consequences for the wellbeing of the people involved, societies, and global security too. Young unemployment people in several parts of the world are the largest area of recruitment for terrorist groups. Guterres also warns that we live in a \u201cdangerous world\u201d today; countries must bolster their efforts to deliver peace. The euro has weakened on Mario Draghi\u2019s comments at the ECB\u2019s first press conference of 2017, with investors interpreting his stance as largely dovish. After announcing its decision to leave key interest rates and the quantitative easing (QE) programme unchanged at its 1,000th board meeting, the ECB president highlighted downside risks to the eurozone economy from \u201cglobal uncertainty\u201d and noted a lack of underlying upward pressure on inflation. Much of the recent rise in inflation, he says, is down to energy price movements and he also pointed out nominal wages growth remains subdued. There is more of that in his opening statement. Draghi appeared keen to send the message that the ECB remains ready to do more to shore up the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery as necessary. Draghi said there was no discussion of tapering - the process of winding down QE. In the wake of criticism from German politicians over how low interest rates were hurting those with savings, he also called on people to be patient with the ECB. He patiently fielded several questions on German low rate angst. To the likely disappointment of reporters at the news conference, the ECB president dodged a question on whether Donald Trump could make life more difficult for those charged with safeguarding the euro after the president elect said in an interview that it would be a struggle keeping the euro together. A careful Draghi said: I just won\u2019t make any comment on that... I would rather comment on policies and policy actions than just statements.\u201d His apparently relaxed stance on inflation left the euro down 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.0600 by the end of the news conference. Against the pound it is down 0.6% on the day to 86.19 pence. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 share index turned positive after the apparent promise of ultra-low interest rates for a very long time to come. Commenting on the tone of the press conference, David Lamb sums up the likely reaction of German politicians: In Berlin, Mario Draghi\u2019s unwavering dovishness will go down about as well as Donald Trump\u2019s hints of tariffs on German cars... With the money-printing set to continue until further notice, inflationary pressures will return and the euro has taken an immediate hit. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima says the\u201drace to the bottom on corporate tax\u201d needs to be addressed. It\u2019s worrying now. We\u2019ve seen the promise from president-elect Trump to cut corporate tax. We\u2019ve heard Theresa May threatening to make Britain a little island with low tax rates on the shores of Europe. These are steps in the wrong direction. This year we need to see progress on this corporate tax competition. This isn\u2019t just an issue of legal compliance, Byanyima continues. The local corner shop where I buy bread probably pays a higher tax rate than Apple. We want to see big companies take this as more than a legal compliance, and see it as a moral issue to society - to provide their fair share to fund heath, education, to create jobs for young people, she adds. Switzerland is now \u2018fighting the good fight\u2019 against tax avoidance today, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. Some background: the new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) come into effect in September 2017, when around 50 jurisdictions will work towards having their first information exchanges. Angel Gurria insists that real progress has been made in fighting tax avoidance and evasion. Back in 2008, there were 30 agreements to share tax information. Today there are 3,500, he says. The promise is enormous, and the potential is very great and it could really help these developing countries. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima is adamant that the current plans don\u2019t go far enough. Simply hiring more tax collectors doesn\u2019t address the use of tax loopholes, or the wider issue of low corporate tax rates. The transparency is good, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough. It doesn\u2019t have public country-by-country recording -- if people don\u2019t know what firms are doing, you\u2019re not going to get the secrecy out and tax them fairly. Panama\u2019s vice-president points the finger at big companies for forcing tax breaks out of developing countries. Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado says some multinationals go to 3rd World companies and \u201cinsist on negotiating tax breaks that local companies don\u2019t have\u201d, in return for siting their operations there. Poland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, reckons the global tax avoidance problem is probably even bigger than that $240bn figure. Morawiecki says that the three countries who make the most foreign direct investment into the European Union are the United States, then Switzerland, then Bermuda. And the list of FDI payments to countries from the EU is exactly the same (ie, the most goes to the US, then Switzerland then Bermuda). If this is not huge, global tax evasion, I don\u2019t know what is. Tax avoidance is a human rights issue, declares Winnie Byanyima, executive director at Oxfam International. She tells her audience at WEF that Kenya is losing $1.1bn every year through tax incentives and tax exceptions. That\u2019s almost double its health budget; in a country where 1 in 40 children die at childbirth. This is really a human rights issue. Byanyima is much less optimist than the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria - she agrees there is progress, but we have a long way to go. She brings a home truth to Davos too: First of all, the developing countries are not at the table, while a notorious tax haven like Switzerland had a place at the table. There is a harmful race to the bottom with countries offering lower tax rates to attract companies (something Philip Hammond has been hinting at), Byanyima adds, saying pointedly: If you can\u2019t dodge taxes, you pay the government to lower the tax rate. Companies need to be forced to provide proper country-by-country reporting of their tax bills, she concludes, to get proper transparency: Yes we are moving, but not fast enough or broadly enough. Panama\u2019s vice-president says her government understands the importance of taxes, both to fund Panama\u2019s spending and to help other countries fight evasion. According to Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado, Panama had been taking action since her government took office 2 and a half-years ago. Before the Panama Papers, President Varela had announced our commitment to automatic information sharing, to the United Nations. And then this leak came, which pointed out a global problem... A global problem which Panama needs to participate in the solution, and the rest of the world needs to participate in the solution. It made us run faster, we were already running. I can say today there is not one issue pending in Panama\u2019s steps to comply with international standards on information sharing, she adds. The panel begins by hearing that countries lose $240bn of tax revenues per year through tax avoidance by companies, according to the OECD 100 countries have signed to an information-sharing deal. Is it making a difference? Absolutely, says the OECD\u2019s Angel Gurria. And that includes Panama, which has signed up too. My message to the Panamanian Congress is - yes, pass the law. Complying with the tax system doesn\u2019t mean changing it, it means enforcing it, Gurria continues. And next September, countries will start automatic information sharing - companies who haven\u2019t reported information correctly will be caught out. Nine months ago the Guardian exposed how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca was helping some of the world\u2019s richest people, and its largest companies, avoid tax. Those revelations helped to drive the issue of aggressive tax avoidance high up the political agenda. Now, a heavyweight group at Davos are discussing how to get multinational companies to pay a fair share -- an issue Theresa May also highlighted in her speech. On the panel: Angel Gurr\u00eda: Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Winnie Byanyima: Executive Director, Oxfam International Valdis Dombrovskis: Vice-President and Commissioner, Euro and Socia..., European Commission Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado: Vice-President of Panama Mateusz Morawiecki: Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Here\u2019s some background reading while we wait for it to start: Chancellor Philip Hammond turned a bit lyrical when he spoke to business leaders today, telling them that the \u201cfog of Brexit\u201d was starting to lift. \u201cWe are not going to get rid of it overnight but I hope gradually it will start to lift. A few things are becoming clearer through the mist.\u201d The chancellor also stressed that the Government would do whatever necessary to ensure Britain remained competitive in the event that the rest of the EU cuts up rough in the divorce negotiations for Brexit. Hammond said: If somehow despite out best efforts political retribution were to triumph over economic logic, and we don\u2019t get a fair deal....we will have to do whatever was necessary to ensure the continued competitiveness in those circumstances. \u201cThat\u2019s not a threat. It is a statement of the blindingly obvious.\u201d He returned to the theme in the Q&amp;A session after his speech, saying that a free trade deal with the EU was not the only way for Britain to remain competitive. \u201cWe have reinvented ourselves before and we will do so again if we have to.\u201d Elsewhere in Davos, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has taken another stride onto the world stage by announcing a major sponsorship deal with the Olympics. Ma\u2019s Alibaba has signed up until 2028, and will provide cloud computing services, and help build a new e-commerce platform to flog Olympic branded products to the masses. They\u2019ll also help develop and customise the Olympic Channel, a web site, for a Chinese audience. No pricing details, I\u2019m afraid. Chancellor Philip Hammond has been praising the City, at a lunch with top UK CEOs and journalists. Hammond warns that \u2018fragmenting the City\u2019 isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interests, but he has also repeated his warning that the UK could lower taxes and regulations if it can\u2019t get a good Brexit deal: Hammond also touches on the customs union issue that is worrying Sir Angus Deaton: Away from Davos, the European Central Bank has confirmed it is leaving its key interest rates unchanged and not tinkering any more for now with its bond-buying programme, AKA quantitative easing (QE). Amid signs that inflation and growth are picking up, the Frankfurt-based central bank for the eurozone also stuck to its previous guidance that it stood ready to act should things take a turn for the worse. The full statement is here, but here\u2019s a flavour: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases... If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the [asset purchase] programme in terms of size and/or duration.\u201d We will get a clearer sense of how ECB policymakers see things when president Mario Draghi hosts a news conference at 13.30GMT. The ECB surprised markets in December by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u20ac60bn (\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u20ac80bn currently. But whatever you do, don\u2019t try and tell Mario Draghi that\u2019s tapering. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who isn\u2019t at Davos, alas) has responded to May\u2019s speech: \u201cToday in Davos the Prime Minister talked about making globalisation work for all. But actions speak louder than words. \u201cAt every opportunity, the Conservatives have given handouts to the wealthiest and cut taxes for big business - while refusing to provide vital funds for the NHS, cutting social care and ditching rights at work. \u201cTheresa May\u2019s vision for Brexit is now clear: a bargain basement Britain on the shores of Europe based on low pay and deregulation. \u201cThis week we heard the Prime Minister threaten to turn Britain into a tax haven, slashing corporate taxes and workers\u2019 rights in an all-out race to the bottom. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be taken in by warm words. This Conservative Government is backed to the hilt by wealthy elites, lines the pockets of its friends and resists all practical steps to make a fairer Britain work for all\u201d. Nobel prize winner Sir Angus Deaton tells me that May\u2019s speech missed out some key issues. For starters, there was no mention of Scotland - Deaton\u2019s home country. He wants to be a member of the European Union, and a member of the United Kingdom - and now that doesn\u2019t seem possible. And on trade, Deaton says: I was also surprised she talked about free trade all the time, and she didn\u2019t talk about the customs union. That\u2019s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain. So I haven\u2019t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out. This was the first time that Deaton has watched May speak in the flesh, and he was reminded of an earlier Conservative leader. The immediate analogy when you see her for the first time is, this looks like Mrs Thatcher. But when you listen to her, she\u2019s sort of the anti-Thatcher in some sense. Mrs Thatcher used to say there is no society, while she was talking about society. Mrs Thatcher would have not been very keen on taking us out of the EU. So it really is very different from Mrs Thatcher. Theresa May\u2019s stern rebuke to businesses who are not paying a fair share of tax sounded good in the cavernous WEF hall. However, we should remember that Britain has been lowering its own corporation tax rate for years to attract firms to base here. And just last week, chancellor Philip Hammond threatened that the UK might abandon European-style regulations and taxes after Brexit, if the economy struggles. The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Liberal Democrat party, Tim Farron, says: \u201cThe Prime Minister certainly has a brass neck. She goes to Davos to lecture businesses about looking after the little guy yet she threatens to turn the UK into a Europe\u2019s biggest tax haven. \u201cThis shows, yet again, that this Tory government are treating our country like UK plc. They are running our economy like it is a closing down sale. But higher prices and more expensive fuel mean families will feel the brunt of this government\u2019s bad economic policies.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s speech may have been a hot ticket at Davos and generally well received by those present, but the market reaction back home was far more muted than the wild gyrations seen during Tuesday\u2019s Brexit performance. For a start the speech was shorter - only half an hour compared to around 50 minutes - and revealed no new details of Brexit strategy. The pound was already up 0.47% at $1.2314 against the dollar at the start of the speech, hit a peak of $1.2332 and then as she finished, drifted back to where it started but still showing a positive move for the day. Against the euro, the pound had edged up 0.19% at the start, and ended up 0.16% at \u20ac1.1548. The FTSE 100, down due to the rise in the pound dampening enthusiasm for overseas earners, dipped lower during the speech, from 7216 to 7208, down 0.55% on the day so far. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound seemed to react well to Theresa May\u2019s Davos speech this Thursday, with the first ECB meeting of 2017 still to come... It was the tone that mattered more than the content, with May framing the Brexit vote as, however incredulously, a defence of globalisation and free trade. This did, however, lead the FTSE more than 40 points lower, the UK index hampered not only by the pound\u2019s rebound but also the losses in its commodity and banking sectors, as well as the 6% post-third quarter update decline seen by Royal Mail. London mayor Sadiq Khan tells us that it\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d that Theresa May is in Davos today. But he also warns that her Brexit speech on Tuesday, in which she confirmed Britain would leave the Single Market, has spooked some in the City. On a whistle-stop trip around Davos, Khan tells us that firms who leave London are unlikely to permanently relocate to Europe. I think the fact she\u2019s got a plan is welcome. I think the fact she\u2019s here is brilliant But I think she needs to be listening to what our friends, chief executives, innovators, entrepreneurs, political leaders are saying, which is that no-one is bringing us bad will. There\u2019s no bad feeling here. But there\u2019s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no-one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe. Businesses that leave London aren\u2019t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Frankfurt, they\u2019re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Khan says he fully accepts the referendum result, but argues that \u201cno-one voted to make us poorer\u201d. So the government must make it a priority to get \u201cprivileged access to the single market\u201d so London can still attract talent. The good news is that over the last six months Google, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat have expanded their presence in London. But the bad news is that, as a consequence of the speech on Tuesday we have some banks and investment firms expressing unease about their future. Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has also given May a thumbs-up for her comments on making globalisation work. Speaking to AFP newswires here, she said: It was a good speech. She captured lots of the concerns about a responsible globalisation that we all talk about. Katherine Garrett-Cox, the former chief executive of Alliance Trust, tells me that Theresa May gave Davos what it wanted. I think she did a very good job of setting out a clear plan in terms of what Britain intends to do, what Britain intends to stand for, and I think that\u2019s really what people wanted to hear. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of criticism over the past six months over where does this start and where does it go. I think we heard very clearly that that\u2019s the plan, and now we\u2019ve got to get on and do it. Q: Can we do it, though, at the same time as negotiating Brexit? We\u2019ve all heard that the divorce, as people have called it, is going to be complicated and complex. But I think we all have to believe that we can do it, so I\u2019m optimistic. Q: What\u2019s your biggest concern now with Brexit? My biggest concern is that businesses step up and embrace the opportunity rather than constantly looking for the downside. I\u2019ve grabbed a word with Dr Paul Sheard, the chief global economist of Standard &amp; Poors, outside the conference room. He says May gave a \u201cvery good\u201d speech. Theresa May was laying down a stake and saying - Britain will be the lead supporting voice for globalisation in the world. A lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She\u2019s pivoting to saying \u2018no, this is about Britain being very global\u2019. We now have two global leaders, President Xi Jinping and Theresa May, both making a pitch in support of globalisation, Sheard adds. Two days ago, Chinese president Xi Jinping wowed Davos with a speech defending globalisation, at a time when Donald Trump has put free trade under threat. And now Theresa May has declared that Britain is determined to become a more powerful player after Brexit, despite the difficult negotiations ahead. 1) She seemed to give Davos what it wanted to hear, saying that the UK will be a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d after leaving the EU I want the UK to emerge from this period of change as a truly Global Britain \u2013 the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too; a country that gets out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. 2) She threw her weight behind the growing pressure to fix globalisation to address the populist surge in politics; a major issue this year. May, though, took an almost moral tone, speaking about how the responsibilities we have to one another have been forgotten. This was the key line: But just as we need to act to address the deeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years, so we also need to recognise the way in which a more global and individualistic world can sometimes loosen the ties that bind our society together, leaving some people feeling locked out and left behind. 3) She was interventionist, highlighting her industrial strategy and saying: For government, it means not just stepping back and \u2013 as the prevailing orthodoxy in many countries has argued for so many years \u2013 not just getting out of the way. Not just leaving businesses to get on with the job and assuming that problems will just fix themselves. It means stepping up to a new, active role that backs businesses and ensures more people in all corners of the country share in the benefits of its success. 4) And she criticised business leaders too, especially those multinationals who can seem to play by different rules. Theresa May ended her speech with a call on global leaders and business chiefs to work together to make globalisation work for everyone. As we build a new, bold, confident Global Britain and shape a new era of globalisation that genuinely works for all As we harness the forces of globalisation so that the system works for everyone, and so maintain public support for that system for generations to come. I want that to be the legacy of our time. To use this moment to provide responsive, responsible leadership that will bring the benefits of free trade to every corner of the world; that will lift millions more out of poverty and towards prosperity; and that will deliver security, prosperity and belonging for all of our people. May returns to the downsides of globalisation - and the damage it has done to societies. Too often today, the obligations we have to each other have been forgotten, she says. We need to recognise how a more global and individualistic world can loosen the ties that bind us together. And May stakes her flag firmly, declaring: I am determined that centre-ground mainstream politics can respond to the concerns people have today. That means standing up for free trade and globalisation, but also ensuring it works for everyone. And she quotes Edmund Burke, who wrote: A state without the means for some change is without the means for its own conservation. May insists that governments have an obligation to help those who need help the most. If you\u2019re just getting by, you don\u2019t want a government that gets out of the way - you want one that will help you. Government and business need to do even more to make the case for globalisation, May continues. She cites her new industrial strategy -- a term that had fallen into disrepute in recent years. But Britain is going to create the conditions where winners can grow and thrive, not about \u2018picking winners\u2019. We must step up and take control to make sure that free trade and globalisation works for everyone. May now addresses the UK business leaders in the audience - saying they must do more to help the public. She cites the importance of everyone paying a fair share of tax. In the UK, trust with business runs at just 35% among the lowest-income groups. Companies must putting aside short-term considerations, and investing in people and communities for the long term. There is a feeling that some companies, especially multinationals, are playing by a different set of rules to everyone else, May declares. It is essential for business to show leadership - to show that in this globalised world, everyone is playing by the same rules. On globalisation, May reiterates that some people are being left behind by economic changes - they are getting by but not getting on. On slavery, May urges her audience to help tackle this abhorent problem; she has convened a top-level panel at Davos today to seek solutions. May reminds the audience of the dark days in the first half of the 20th century. We must uphold the institutions that help the world to work together, and guarantee global security. May also cites Britain\u2019s multicultural heritage. May is outlining her vision of making Britain a truly global country. We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again. A country in charge of its own destiny is in a better position to take the lead in improving the world, she continues. She cites the fact that some of Britain\u2019s most famous car brands, like Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by India\u2019s Tata. Brexit was a vote to take control, and make decisions ourselves, May continues. Britain\u2019s history and culture is profoundly international, she says. We have always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We are, by instinct, a great global trading nation. And we want to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world. She welcomes the fact that preliminary talks are underway with several countries including Australia, while China and the Gulf States have expressed interest in making deals with us. Britain faces a time of momentous change, and tough negotiations, May says, following the Brexit vote. But we must believe that it will lead to a better future British people chose to build a truly global country, May says. And we face the future with confidence. May\u2019s on the stage now. This is an organisation that is committed to improving the state of the world. Those of us who meet here are optimists, who believe in the power of public and private collaboration to make the world tomorrow better than today. Free trade, partnership and globalisation. But outside this hall, those forces for good which we take for granted are being called into question. Forces that have had such a positive impact, lifting millions out of poverty, broken down barriers and raised living standards, are now being undermined. As we meet here, across Europe parties of the far left and far right are trying to profit from a keenly felt sense, especially among those on modest incomes, that these forces are not working for them. These people feel that mainstream political and business leaders have failed to appreciate their legitimate concerns for too long, May says. But she will lay out an agenda for how mainstream politics can address this. Davos\u2019s founder Klaus Schwab has taken the stage, to introduce Theresa May. Schwab says he was born before world war 2 broke out - for him, Europe was a big dream of never having war again, and feeling united. He says he\u2019s very pleased to hear Theresa May say that the UK will not leave Europe, but will have a very amicable divorce. Hammond and Khan are now chatting together, as we wait for the PM... Chancellor Philip Hammond just marched into the hall, not far behind Sadiq Khan. Even the global elite have to queue sometimes. There\u2019s a massive line snaking around the conference now, as delegates try to bag a decent seat to watch Theresa May in 25 minutes. There\u2019s a flurry of activity as some of the global elite head into a private meeting in the heart of the WEF conference centre. It looks like an IGWEL - or Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders in the Davos jargon. I\u2019ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and HSBC chairman Douglas Flint arriving (you can see Lagarde here) One insider says they\u2019ll be discussing sustainable development; hopefully they\u2019ll still catch Theresa May\u2019s speech too. London mayor Sadiq Khan is also in Davos today. He\u2019s been meeting with business leaders, and arguing for Britain to get privileged access to the single market. He\u2019s just giving an interview to the BBC now, saying that his message to EU leaders is not to assume the Brexit vote was a one-off. Unless you address the concerns around globalisation, unless you address these issues, if there\u2019s a vote in your country whether to stay or leave the EU don\u2019t be surprised if your voters decide to leave the EU. Good morning from Davos, and day three of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. Theresa May swept into the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re hotel in the centre of this ski resort last night, on the latest stage in her push for Brexit. The UK PM is the hottest act in town today; at 10.15am local time (9.15am GMT) she will deliver a special address to an audience of fellow world leaders, business chiefs and economists. The speech gets top billing: Britain after Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will spell out the economic implications of leaving the European Union May is expected to talk about those who have not prospered under globalisation; linking the Brexit vote into a broader theme that has dominated talk at Davos this week already. One Downing Street source told Sky News overnight that: \u201cThe PM is reflecting themes she\u2019s spoken about before - that change has to come in order to benefit who have been left behind.\u201d May\u2019s likely to use the speech to pitch for more global trade, saying Britain remains open to business despite voting to leave the EU. The speech could also include a hard-hitting section on modern slavery; a priority for May since her days as Britain\u2019s Home Secretary. May is also meeting bank chiefs in Davos, such as Wall Street bosses who are wondering whether to start moving jobs and operations out of the City in anticipation of the UK leaving the single market. Bloomberg: May Meets Wall Streeters in Davos as Banks Plan Brexit Exodus It could be a tricky Davos debut for May; the Guardian reports this morning that European leaders are presenting a united front ahead of the EU exit talks. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, led the way, predicted that negotiating Brexit will be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d But May has allies here too; chancellor Philip Hammond will meet with a clutch of UK business chiefs at a lunch later. We\u2019ve also spied Liam Fox; the Secretary of international trade told us last night that he\u2019s here to make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action from Davos through the day...",

                "bodyText":"Some of the UK\u2019s most prolific and successful ticket touts appear to be rebranding their organisations as the industry braces for investigations by the competition watchdog and the taxman in the UK. Moves among touts to alter their public profiles follow increased scrutiny, including an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into whether they are breaking the law by failing to disclose their identity on ticket resale sites. HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) is also examining the industry after MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee demanded an inquiry into touts\u2019 tax affairs. The glare of publicity has prompted a flurry of activity among the most powerful operators, who have developed a stranglehold on tickets for in-demand events, such as an upcoming tour by U2 and the hip-hop musical Hamilton. Andrew Newman, revealed as one of the UK\u2019s most successful touts in an investigation by the Observer, has since changed his company\u2019s name from Newman Corporation to North Financial Group (NFG) and has also deleted his Twitter account. Newman, who did not return requests for comment, recently posted accounts at Companies House showing that NFG had assets of \u00a31.6m in 2015, up from \u00a31.1m the previous year. It is not possible to tell how much profit Newman made because his company is still small enough to be exempt from filing detailed accounts. Peter Hunter, the man behind major touting firm Ticket Wiz, has also changed the name of his company, from Ticket Wiz to BZZ. The change took place on 21 December, two days after the CMA said it planned to investigate the secondary ticketing industry. The regulator is investigating allegations that touts are breaching consumer law by failing to provide their details when they sell a ticket on secondary websites such as Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave. Another of the UK\u2019s most successful touting firms is 1st Choice Tickets, now known as WRT Services. The change of name happened three weeks after MPs on the culture select committee promised an inquiry into ticket abuse and said they would ask HMRC to look into the industry. In some cases, touts have removed tickets from resale websites altogether after the sites published their details in an attempt to show they are complying with consumer law. One company, Tickets2Go2, listed 96 tickets for Take That\u2019s upcoming tour on resale site GetMeIn for a combined \u00a359,000, compared with their face value of \u00a36,240. Shortly after the Guardian contacted GetMeIn, owned by Ticketmaster, the company\u2019s tickets were removed from the website. The owner of Tickets2Go2, Kent-based Aaron Colbourne, did not return requests for comment. In some cases, touts have responded to increased attention by listing their company information and contact details alongside tickets. But none who were contacted by the Guardian agreed to discuss the touting industry on the record. One tout, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m supplying something people can\u2019t go without like housing or food. It\u2019s just entertainment put on for commercial gain.\u201d When the CMA launched its inquiry, it said that three out of four resale sites were now complying with the requirement to publish sellers\u2019 information. But research by the Guardian shows that in many cases the information is incomplete or inaccurate. More than 20 tickets for a U2 concert at Twickenham stadium this summer are listed on StubHub for a combined \u00a37,500 but the name of the firm selling the ticket is not revealed. However, the London address used is the same as that of Double 8 Tickets, a website currently offering U2 tickets and owned by Raymond Sullivan. He did not respond to a request for comment. In other cases, tickets are advertised as being sold by companies that are not registered at Companies House, or listed with a non-existent VAT number. Many touts simply do not publish any of their details at all on secondary websites, despite consumer laws requiring them to do so. While there are dozens of companies operating in the touting world, in practice there are just a few hundred major players, often known as \u201cbrokers\u201d or \u201cpower sellers\u201d by resale websites where they ply their trade. Such websites even offer these touts \u201cbroker tools\u201d, computer programs to help them manage their stocks of tickets. One ticket listed on StubHub for an Adele concert at Wembley Stadium includes a note, presumably directed to the resale site rather than consumers, that reads: \u201cCan you please provide us with a broker tool?\u201d StubHub did not respond to a request for information about broker tools. A representative of the website told MPs last year that it does not \u201cpolice or monitor\u201d whether touts using its site comply with the law by publishing their details. At the same evidence session, StubHub and Ticketmaster said that while they make it possible for seller to publish their details, it is up to the touts themselves to do so. Secondary sites, which take a commission of up to 25% on ticket sales, have previously been accused of having too close a relationship with touts. Such close relationships help touts make the best possible profit from resale and leave fans even more exposed to buying from these secretive entrepreneurs at massive mark-ups.",

He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u2019s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar.</p> <p>Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. </p> <p>A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u201ccut regulations by 75%\u201d, \u201ccut taxes massively\u201d for the middle class while imposing a \u201cvery major border tax\u201d. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767.

The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

The consultancy\u2019s John Higgins said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Admittedly, Trump\u2019s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range.</p> <p>We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270.</p> <p>Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u201cnatural\u201d level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders at the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders at the New York Stock Exchange</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level.</p> <p>As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period.</p> <p>Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u2019s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high.</p> <p>Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862c63e4b0b7484e0a3025\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T16:19:00.233Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president.</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years.</p> <p>If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities. Given today\u2019s 45 day low for the dollar index, it seems the Trump boost seems to have run its course, for now.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Dow is currently down 75 points or 0.38%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T16:28:09.210Z\">at 4.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58862351e4b0c3a2fc6ee871\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T15:39:48.231Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still with the confidence figures, ING economist Bert Colijn said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Improvements in the job market seem to be outweighing concerns about political volatility among consumers for the moment. Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017.</p> <p>Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862117e4b0dd6f5509d3b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T15:34:03.171Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u2013 as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms.<em> </em>Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties.</p> <p>January\u2019s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725354a58d109c8694cb514edff6887475fb1721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725354a58d109c8694cb514edff6887475fb1721/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European consumer confidence improves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European consumer confidence improves</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Peter/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u2013 particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. </p> <p>Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months.</p> <p>Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union.

The reason will be that parliament will have much more to say in triggering Article 50 and most importantly, it fades the chances of Scotland prompting another referendum.

As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index.</p> <p>On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling.

The euro has also crept higher, to $1.0735, as the US currency fell on the FX markets.</p> <p><strong>FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga</strong> blames uncertainty for the moves.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global stocks traded lower on Monday as the Trump fueled uncertainties, rising political risks, and overall market jitters dented investors risk appetite.</p> <p>Asian shares failed to maintain gains while the risk-off sentiment sent European markets into the red territory.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fears that the new US president could spark trade wars with China, or with countries close to home, have dominated today.</p> <p>These concerns got another bump after US media reported that Trump will sign an executive order today to start the renegotiation of NAFTA.</p> <p><strong>Analysts at Dutch bank ING</strong> explain why traders are edgy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While President Trump\u2019s \u2018too strong\u2019 dollar comment and combative inaugural address has taken some of the steam out of the greenback\u2019s rally, we remain wary that dollar strength could be the ultimate by-product of the new President\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy stance. Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration. With a US economy already close to full employment, it is difficult not to see Trump\u2019s fiscal plans generating sufficient inflationary pressures to drive US yields and the dollar higher.<br></p> <p>But equally, investors are placing greater focus on future US trade and foreign policy. Naturally the market may be bracing itself for President Trump to formally name China a currency manipulator. In practice, this would spark bilateral negotiations rather than any immediate tariffs but presumably the market wouldn\u2019t take too kindly to this.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>That has weighed on the London stock market; the FTSE 100 is currently down 42 points at 7156, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/23/pound-hits-five-week-high-as-trump-fears-weaken-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-5885d914e4b00b8fc2ae40a4#block-5885d914e4b00b8fc2ae40a4\">meaning its early 2017 gains have been wiped out.</a></strong></p> <p>The City\u2019s new year optimism has rather fizzled out, as <strong>Conner Campbell </strong>of <strong>SpreadEx</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having hit a fresh all-time high this time last Monday, an aggressively negative series of sessions last week, largely inspired by the pound\u2019s gains following Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speeches, has effectively wiped away the remarkable gains it managed in the first fortnight of 2017.</p> <p>The FTSE still has a way to go before it dips under the key 7000 level; however, the index\u2019s rampant optimism does seem to have come to an end in conjunction with the pound beginning to peek its head above the parapet after a month or so of suffering.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trump anxiety, and the weak dollar, also helped to push the gold price up to a two-month high, as part of a general move to safer assets.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5885fcf2e4b00b8fc2ae4183\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T13:07:14.749Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US media are reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that would start the process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (the free trade bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/823508989229023233\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Trump to sign orders as early as today to renegotiate NAFTA and pull out of TPP - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews\">@NBCNews</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wDzeDfOMZ0\">https://t.co/wDzeDfOMZ0</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/823508989229023233\">January 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to those paying attention to the US election, as Paul McNamara of investment group GAM points out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/M_PaulMcNamara/status/823513842311426050\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump Executive Order to renegotiate NAFTA confuses investors who&#39;ve spent last year under a rock.</p>&mdash; Paul McNamara (@M_PaulMcNamara) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M_PaulMcNamara/status/823513842311426050\">January 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5885f288e4b00b8fc2ae4143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T12:32:57.757Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile in Europe, protesting farmers have been spraying powdered milk at the EU council headquarters in Brussels.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e8af61ddd7de3a140fae5c20a0e7681a04389fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e8af61ddd7de3a140fae5c20a0e7681a04389fc/0_0_4096_2823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EMB protest in Brusselsepa05744184 European Milk board (EMB) representatives spray milk powder in front of the EU Council headquarters, during an EU Agriculture Ministers Council meeting in Brussels, Belgium, 23 January 2017.

                "bodyText":"Investors were cautious as Donald Trump made a number of moves in his first day in office as US president, including plans to renegotiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u2019s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar. Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u201ccut regulations by 75%\u201d, \u201ccut taxes massively\u201d for the middle class while imposing a \u201cvery major border tax\u201d. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767. The 20,000 level, within tantalising reach just a couple of weeks ago, is receding fast. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.8% against a weakening dollar at $1.2476, still at a five week high. The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The weakness in the dollar and hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans will boost demand are helping to buoy up metal prices, with copper up 0.8% on the London Metal Exchange. In turn that has lifted mining groups, with Antofagasta rising up nearly 4% and Anglo American adding 1.5%. Precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo are also in demand as investors seek havens amid the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s presidency. The US is set to renogiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, and our latest report is here: US markets could be set for further falls as the initial Trump boost fades and a possible recession looms, reckons Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s John Higgins said: We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse. Admittedly, Trump\u2019s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range. We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270. Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u201cnatural\u201d level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy. What\u2019s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period. Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u2019s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high. Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side. On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president. Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room. Trump\u2019s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years. If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities. Given today\u2019s 45 day low for the dollar index, it seems the Trump boost seems to have run its course, for now. The Dow is currently down 75 points or 0.38%. Still with the confidence figures, ING economist Bert Colijn said: Improvements in the job market seem to be outweighing concerns about political volatility among consumers for the moment. Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017. Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic. The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said: First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u2013 as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties. January\u2019s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u2013 particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months. Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union. The UK\u2019s Brexit vote last June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. Over in Europe, consumer confidence improved in January to a 21 month high, but not by as much as expected. According to the European Commission, consumer confidence in the eurozone rose by 0.2 points to -4.9, compared to expectations of a figure of -4.8. In the wider European Union it improved 0.3 points to -4.3 from December. With the concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist strategy heightened by the new President\u2019s inauguration speech hitting the dollar and prompting investors to seek havens, US markets have edged lower at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 13 points or 0.06% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.145. Meanwhile Trump has been telling a number of US chief executives that companies will get fast approval to build in the US, but those that move abroad will face major border taxes on goods coming into the US. The UK Supreme Court is due to make its decision on Tuesday on whether MPs are entitled to have a vote on triggering Article 50, the process of leaving the EU. Whichever way the ruling goes, the pound and the markets are bound to be affected. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision, both FTSE and sterling are the major focus for investors. If the Supreme court provides a decision which is against the government\u2019s unilateral power (triggering the article 50), we could see sterling moving higher. The reason will be that parliament will have much more to say in triggering Article 50 and most importantly, it fades the chances of Scotland prompting another referendum. Scotland can no longer play the card that the Brexit is against their will if the vote comes to the parliament. As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index. On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling. Traders will perceive that Theresa May is going to achieve her \u201cclean\u201d Brexit without major hurdles. For the FTSE 100, lower sterling has provided ammunition for higher moves. Time for a quick catch-up, and the latest reaction to today\u2019s developments. Worries over Donald Trump\u2019s early moves as president are driving the markets today, weakening the US dollar as investors fret about a new wave of protectionism. The pound has hit its highest level since mid-December, currently up almost one cent at $1.246. The euro has also crept higher, to $1.0735, as the US currency fell on the FX markets. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga blames uncertainty for the moves. Global stocks traded lower on Monday as the Trump fueled uncertainties, rising political risks, and overall market jitters dented investors risk appetite. Asian shares failed to maintain gains while the risk-off sentiment sent European markets into the red territory. Fears that the new US president could spark trade wars with China, or with countries close to home, have dominated today. These concerns got another bump after US media reported that Trump will sign an executive order today to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. Analysts at Dutch bank ING explain why traders are edgy: While President Trump\u2019s \u2018too strong\u2019 dollar comment and combative inaugural address has taken some of the steam out of the greenback\u2019s rally, we remain wary that dollar strength could be the ultimate by-product of the new President\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy stance. Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration. With a US economy already close to full employment, it is difficult not to see Trump\u2019s fiscal plans generating sufficient inflationary pressures to drive US yields and the dollar higher. But equally, investors are placing greater focus on future US trade and foreign policy. Naturally the market may be bracing itself for President Trump to formally name China a currency manipulator. In practice, this would spark bilateral negotiations rather than any immediate tariffs but presumably the market wouldn\u2019t take too kindly to this. That has weighed on the London stock market; the FTSE 100 is currently down 42 points at 7156, meaning its early 2017 gains have been wiped out. The City\u2019s new year optimism has rather fizzled out, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having hit a fresh all-time high this time last Monday, an aggressively negative series of sessions last week, largely inspired by the pound\u2019s gains following Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speeches, has effectively wiped away the remarkable gains it managed in the first fortnight of 2017. The FTSE still has a way to go before it dips under the key 7000 level; however, the index\u2019s rampant optimism does seem to have come to an end in conjunction with the pound beginning to peek its head above the parapet after a month or so of suffering. Trump anxiety, and the weak dollar, also helped to push the gold price up to a two-month high, as part of a general move to safer assets. US media are reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that would start the process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (the free trade bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico). This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to those paying attention to the US election, as Paul McNamara of investment group GAM points out: Meanwhile in Europe, protesting farmers have been spraying powdered milk at the EU council headquarters in Brussels. The demonstration, organised by the European Milk Board, is meant to put pressure on ministers to help support milk powder prices. According to news service Agriland, the farmers want the EU to agree not to release stocks from the EU\u2019s milk powder mountain. That would allow them to cut production and push up prices. The EMB says: \u201cThe dairy market is still stuck in a crisis. Voluntary production cuts might have led to a rise in prices, but the sale of milk powder from EU intervention stocks would, once again, put the market under pressure.\u201d \u201cWe need a permanent crisis instrument that prevents surpluses on the dairy market and leads to long-term stability,\u201d according to the board. AFP\u2019s Marine Laouchez of AFP filmed a videoclip of the protests: Newsflash: Mario Draghi is now collecting the 2016 Camillo Cavour prize, awarded for his work strengthening Italy. And the ECB president is talking about the instability currently in play in Italy and beyond, as he compares the situation today to the mid-19th century, when Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, helped unify Italy. His speech is on the ECB website, in Italian -- here\u2019s what Google Translate makes of it.... Cavour acted in a European context suddenly destabilized by the 1848 revolutions that had disrupted the balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna after the fall of Napoleon. It was a period of turbulent transition, in which for the protagonists of European politics opened large joint opportunities to large risks. Today we are again in a historical phase in which Europe is moving, after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, the reunification of Germany, the effects of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the UK via exit \u2018 European Union, the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. In different words, now as then we could say that it is looking for a new stability. ECB president Mario Draghi has just been sighted in Turin, where he\u2019ll be giving a speech at a prize-giving ceremony (in memory of Italian statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour) We\u2019ll watch out for any monetary policy signals from Draghi (who left interest rates unchanged last week) The eurozone\u2019s total national debt has shrunk to its smallest level in four years, when measured against its total economy. New figures from Eurostat show that the euro area national debt dropped to 90.1% of GDP in the July-September 2016 quarter, almost a whole percentage point lower than the previous three months. That means that Europe\u2019s economy has been growing at a slightly faster rate than its borrowing has expanded: Today\u2019s selloff means the FTSE 100 has lost virtually all the gains it made this year. The rally that began after the shock US election result in early November appears to have petered out, as investors face the reality of a Trump presidency. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there is a gloomy mood in the markets, with the FTSE 100 currently down 41 points at 7156. The week has started on a bearish note, with the FTSE 100 falling over 40 points in early trading. The index has lost around 3% since its peak earlier in January, although it has held the breakout line of 7130 that marked its previous high. The steady deterioration in risk appetite over the past few days nicely bookends the post-election period, which began with such furious buying of stocks. Disappointment has set in, but it has not yet turned to disillusionment. This chart, from the Wall Street Journal, show how market volatility has risen while money flowed out of the markets last week: City investors are disappointed that Trump\u2019s inauguration speech contained little detail on fiscal policy, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. As Kit Juckes of French Bank Societe Generale puts it: Instead, the message was combative, protectionist and isolationist, while the media focus was on the size of crowds and the women\u2019s movement marches in the US and elsewhere. Here\u2019s our take on Crowdgate: London\u2019s stock market has opened in the red. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 64 points, or 0.9%, to 7134 points. That\u2019s partly due to the strength of the pound (which will hurt exporters, and make UK shares more expensive for foreign investors to buy). Financial stocks are leading the selloff, with Admiral Group down 2.5%, RBS down 2.2% and Barclays losing 2%. Other European markets are also falling, with anxiety over Trump to the fore. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the markets are being driven by the weaker dollar this morning. So far the new president has stoked protectionism but offered little detail on the good stuff \u2013 pro-growth infrastructure spending, stimulus etc. That\u2019s ensuring the dollar starts the week on the back foot, trading at its weakest since early December. Gold is trading at a two-month high as safe haven assets are bid. We\u2019ll be looking for more details on spending and growth plans in the coming days, which could revive the long dollar trade. The dollar is down 0.5% against other currencies this morning. RBC Capital Markets blame: ...the lack of economic policy detail in President Trump\u2019s inauguration speech coupled with concerns over his potential protectionist stance. Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric is driving down the US dollar this morning. The greenback is in retreat against most major currencies, sending the British pound up 0.75 of a cent to $1.245. That\u2019s its highest level since 19 December. Ilya Spivak of Daily FX reports that traders are anxious, piling into US debt and the Japanese yen, and gold of course. The euro is also gaining ground, up 0.35% at $1.074 this morning. Trump\u2019s unpopularity, unpredictability and unyielding determination to put US interests first are all worrying for traders, who have the unenviable task of trying to guess his next move. Kathleen Brooks of City Index say investors will be watching Trump\u2019s first week as president closely: After the \u201cjoyless rant\u201d of Trump\u2019s inauguration speech on Friday (to paraphrase Simon Schama, writing in the FT at the weekend), the world is watching to see what will be included in the rush of executive orders that are forecast to come in the coming days. This will hopefully give us an idea if Trump has a coherent set of views that could be considered a plausible economic policy. If his team use \u201calternative facts\u201d about the size of the much-anticipated infrastructure spending programme, for instance, or if he walks away from rolling back years of financial market regulation, two key drivers of the stock market rally since Trump\u2019s election in November, then the stock market rally could whither and die. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are starting the week in a nervous mood, as Donald Trump gets his feet under the Oval Office desk. Gold has hit a two-month high in early trading, with investors anxious about the new president\u2019s combative inauguration speech on Friday. Trump\u2019s vow to put America First means more worries about protectionism, and potential trade wars. Bullion is changing hands at $1,217 per ounce, the highest since late November, in a sign that investors are looking for safe assets. Many City experts are predicting that trading will be edgy in the next few months, as Reuters explains: With the lack of a clear policy direction from Trump, the market movement is a sign that risk aversion is back on the table, OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan said. The market could witness volatility into the first 100 days of the Trump administration, he added. Shares in Europe are expected to drop too, as local currencies gain against the US dollar. Also coming up The economic calendar is a little sparse today, but there are a few things to watch out for: 11.30am GMT: ECB President Mario Draghi will deliver a speech on the occasion of the awarding of the Premio Camillo Cavour organised by Fondazione Camillo Cavour in Turin 1.15pm GMT: ECB Board Member Peter Praet delivers a speech at \u201cEuropean Pillar of Social Rights Conference\u201d, in Brussels 3pm: The EC\u2019s monthly Eurozone consumer confidence survey",

But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities.</p> <p>Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888d840e4b0cea1f09276aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:55:10.715Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets.

Reuters writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. </p> <p> In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. </p> <p> The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888cb8de4b0cea1f0927647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:05:13.128Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high.</p> <p>Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished.</p> <p>Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality.</p> <p>There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier.</p> <p>These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6<sup>th</sup>. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c0cee4b0cea1f09275f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:17:18.980Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: The moment that the Dow hit 20,000 for the first time ever <a href=\"https://t.co/0fvzncrKtP\">pic.twitter.com/0fvzncrKtP</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888bd1ce4b029dbeb0a64d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:59:27.717Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the big movers so far in the Dow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1/0_0_637_684/466.jpg\" alt=\"Dow movers\" width=\"466\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow movers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:46:34.880Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5888ba23e4b0cea1f09275d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:53:49.677Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1/0_0_1180_759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow hits 20,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow hits 20,000</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888b93ee4b0cea1f09275cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:43:41.039Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier.

It\u2019s psychologically huge and, after a bit of pullback ahead of the inauguration, really confirms that the \u2018great rotation\u2019 from bonds to stocks is definitely upon us. Fears about protectionism are running second to optimism about inflation and growth \u2013 for now at least.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, far from roiling markets, has been greeted with universal optimism about what it means for global growth. Something like $3trillion has been pulled from bonds and $3trillion pumped into equities. President Trump is bound to take credit for the rally, and he may well be justified to some degree...</p> <p>The question now is how long can this last? Economists are usually unwise to make predictions, so it\u2019s worth considering both potential outcomes. </p> <p>One argument says that Trump will usher in a Reaganesque shift in the US economy, fuelling a massive reallocation of investment from cash to productive capital...</p> <p>Trump\u2019s first steps as president have confirmed much of what investors had hoped for and that he\u2019s extremely pro-business and light on regulation for energy and financials.

                "bodyText":"The global market surge which has led to the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally breaking through the 20,000 has also seen other markets move higher. The records set by the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite, boosted by the Trump rally and reasonable updates from US stalwarts such as Boeing, have helped lift European markets. Good results from Logitech and Banco Santander were also a factor in the confident mood on the continent. But with the dollar weakening and pushing the pound to six week highs - sterling is now up 0.8% at $1.2620 - the FTSE 100 has missed out on much of the gains. The leading UK index is packed with overseas earners who have benefited from a weak pound but tend to lose ground when sterling strengthens. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% or 14.09 points to 7164.43 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.82% to 11,806.05 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.99% to 4877.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.42% higher at 19,582.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.73% at 9549.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.96% to 659.19 On Wall Street the Dow is now up 144 points or 0.7% at 20,056. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. There is much talk about whether the current stock market levels mean we are in a new bubble phase (leading fund manager Neil Woodford recently compared the euphoria of recent months to the dotcom boom and bust). But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities. Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields. And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets. Via Twitter of course: Away from the Dow for a moment, and early elections in Italy could be on the cards after a call ruling. Reuters writes: Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible. The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746. It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains. The S&amp;P is currently 0.6% higher, while Nasdaq is 0.74% better. And some seem confident the US rally will continue. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high. Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished. Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality. There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force. We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies. There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In all honesty it couldn\u2019t have come a moment too soon, finally putting us out of our misery so we can start to focus on something else more important. On a serious note, while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the breaking of a significant milestone, in the broader scheme of things it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, apart from giving investors a feel good boost. Of more importance is whether or not it is able to sustain these gains at a time when US stocks are already considered expensive. It looked for a while as if the Trump rally which followed the election of the US president was about to run out of steam, as the Dow tried and failed a couple of times to breach the 20,000 barrier. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier. These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record. It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6th. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced. Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates. And here are the big movers so far in the Dow: Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride. The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier. Dominic Rushe writes: The Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through the 20,000 barrier on Wednesday morning \u2013 a historic high for the leading stock market index and one it has been close to breaching since Christmas. The Dow, which first nearly topped 20,000 on 13 December and again on 6 January, when it came within 0.37 points of the landmark, finally broke through after the opening bell was rung on Wall Street by Ashton Poole, CEO of lender Triangle Capital. The closing bell will be rung by executives from InBev, brewers of Stella Artois but whether the Dow\u2019s rise will go flat by then remains to be seen. The market had rallied sharply in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory but seemed to loose steam ahead of his first day in office. It broke the barrier of Wednesday after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market\u2019s open, boosted by Trump\u2019s renewed pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment. The Dow record comes as the S&amp;P 500 index, tech-heavy Nasdaq and London\u2019s FTSE 100 stock market index have all hit record highs. So is this a bubble or something sustainable? Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said The Dow has capped a remarkable rally since Donald Trump\u2019s election by finally breaking the 20,000 level. It\u2019s psychologically huge and, after a bit of pullback ahead of the inauguration, really confirms that the \u2018great rotation\u2019 from bonds to stocks is definitely upon us. Fears about protectionism are running second to optimism about inflation and growth \u2013 for now at least. Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, far from roiling markets, has been greeted with universal optimism about what it means for global growth. Something like $3trillion has been pulled from bonds and $3trillion pumped into equities. President Trump is bound to take credit for the rally, and he may well be justified to some degree... The question now is how long can this last? Economists are usually unwise to make predictions, so it\u2019s worth considering both potential outcomes. One argument says that Trump will usher in a Reaganesque shift in the US economy, fuelling a massive reallocation of investment from cash to productive capital... Trump\u2019s first steps as president have confirmed much of what investors had hoped for and that he\u2019s extremely pro-business and light on regulation for energy and financials. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving this renewed rally. The other argument claims that this is a massive bubble, irrational exuberance of the worst kind that will come unstuck when Trump fails to deliver the reflationary policies that the market is pinning its hopes on... However, bull markets normally only turn into bear markets on an expected downturn in the real economy. There is little evidence that the US is heading for recession \u2013 quite the reverse as Trump is ushering a new era of pro-business policies that affirm growth prospects. We are seeing a massive shift in investor sentiment that has seen money pour out of bonds and into equities around the world. This is a major recalibration in global stocks and bond markets \u2013 ie, not a bubble in the pure sense, although it might be rising faster than is natural. [If] this is a real rotation from bonds into stocks, ending a 30-year bond bull market, there is still a huge amount of cash piled up that could yet pour into equities and power further gains through 2017. It might not be too long before 21,000 is in sight. And it\u2019s there! The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 116 points and has crossed through 20,000 for the first time. Just a couple of minutes now until Wall Street opens and the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average could indeed make 20,000 for the first time. The Trump rally and some positive trading updates from the likes of Boeing and hard drive maker Seagate look set to help push markets higher. Elsewhere, shares in BT are struggling to make any ground after Tuesday\u2019s 21% slump in the wake of an accounting scandal at its Italian business and a weak outlook for a couple of its other divisions. They have edged up 0.7% to 305.1p, but this is not exactly a big dent in Tuesday\u2019s \u00a38bn loss. Meanwhile Italian prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating BT Italy. Milan prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale told FastFT that the probe was focused on allegations of \u201cfalse accounting and embezzlement\u201d, as reported on Tuesday. And to add to BT\u2019s woes, the situation is also being looked at by the Financial Reporting Council, which said: \u201dWe are aware of BT\u2019s statement about its review of accounting issues in its Italian business and we will consider if these matters require the FRC to investigate whether the auditors fulfilled their duties.\u201d Elsewhere, the head of BT Europe Corrado Sciolla was said on Tuesday to be resigning over the scandal, and now Reuters is reporting that Luis Alvarez, the head of BT Global Service, is expected to take over the running of the European division. IG reckon that Wall Street traders can get the Dow 20k hats out. New York trading begins in 90 minutes time.... After weeks of near-misses, could the Dow Jones finally hit the 20,000 point mark today? The global stock market rally today is raising speculation that the Dow could hit this benchmark for the first time; it closed at 19,912 on Tuesday night. With every European stock market up today, the futures market suggests Wall Street will follow suit, helped by optimism that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for infrastructure spending will boost corporate profits. 20,000 is just a number, of course - but some traders would be happy to get the issue out of the way. If it does happen, expect @realDonaldTrump to take the credit.... The US dollar has dipped to a seven-week low against a basket of other major currencies (including the pound) this morning. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Services, says there is \u201cbroad-based selling pressure on the dollar\u201d. Bloomberg has more details: Boom! The pound just hit $1.26 for the first time since December 14. Newsflash from parliament: Theresa May has just revealed that the government will publish a white paper outlining its Brexit plan. That may please the City, as it will more insight into the government\u2019s ambitions for the EU exit negotiations. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: France\u2019s credit rating could come under threat if populist far-right Marine Le Pen reached the final stage of the country\u2019s presidential race, an official from Moody\u2019s has said. Reuters has the story: Asked whether Le Pen progressing to the second round would prompt Moody\u2019s to move the outlook on France\u2019s Aa2 credit rating to negative, Dietmar Hornung said, \u201cThat is the obvious thing.\u201d He gave the example of how Moody\u2019s waited until after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to put the UK\u2019s rating on a negative outlook, however. The negative impact of the rating \u201cwouldn\u2019t persist if then in the second round Fillon or Macron or whoever wins,\u201d he told Reuters. Le Pen is currently second favourite to win the presidential race, behind right-winger Francois Fillon. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard is out! Our monthly healthcheck on the UK economy shows that the fall in the pound following the EU referendum is hurting the economy, pushing inflation higher. The latest retail sales, house prices and trade figures were all disappointing too, although the economy does seem to still be growing steadily (we get new GDP figures tomorrow). My colleague Katie Allen, who compiles the report explains: Seven months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows the weaker pound is being felt in the real economy more keenly than ever, as it raises the cost of imports such as energy and food and that gets passed on to consumers as higher prices in the shops. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for January shows a worse than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. Inflation was higher than economists had forecast, hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s the key charts: And here\u2019s Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former Bank of England policymakers, on the numbers. Just in: UK manufacturers are their most upbeat since January 2015, according to the latest Industrial Trends survey from the CBI. Factories also reported that domestic orders have grown strongly over the last quarter, but export growth has dipped back. The survey shows that the pound\u2019s tumble is pushing up import prices, but it\u2019s also making UK firms more competitive in the global market. And a quarter of companies reported that they are worried they can\u2019t hire skilled staff - that\u2019s the highest level since July 1989. Here\u2019s the report. Optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s spending plans are expected to push shares higher on Wall Street later today. The futures markets shows the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rising by 0.3%, having hit record highs on Tuesday. Relief that the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling is out of the way is pushing the pound towards $1.26, says Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG. Despite yesterday\u2019s court decision, markets continue to enjoy a degree of clarity over the UK\u2019s path that has not been seen since June\u2019s referendum result. With Citibank and Credit Suisse the latest banks to voice their plans to move jobs out of London, it is clear that Theresa May needs to have a robust and dramatic jobs strategy if we are going to see the UK maintain growth over the coming years. The UK pound is having a good morning, rising 0.5% to hit a six-week high of $1.2598 against the dollar. This recovers yesterday\u2019s losses, which came after the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling. Traders are now watching to see what legislation the government brings to trigger the exit process from the EU. Rebellious Conservative MPs are now pushing for a full debate on the Brexit plan, and are concerned about Britain\u2019s likely exit from the single market and the customs union. So the pound is likely to remain volatile. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the length of this Act will be critical: For all the furore (aka political windbagging) around yesterday\u2019s UK Constitutional Court ruling, the only real question is how \u201ctight\u201d the wording of the Act of Parliament (to trigger Article 50) will be. The trick to stopping opponents tagging on conditions would be to make the Act very short, say as little as one paragraph, which would then make it very difficult to change as the rules state that \u201camendments must be ruled to be within the scope of the original text\u201d. It should be emphasized that \u2018no one won anything\u2019 with the ruling, it is a simple principle that Parliament has to be consulted, if a proposed statute implies a change to the UK\u2019s basic law - Article 50 clearly fits that principle 100%. The pound is also up 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.171, meaning one euro is worth 85.3p. That will be welcomed by UK holidaymakers, and eurozone firms who export goods into the UK, points out Dublin-based broker Paul Sommerville. Here\u2019s Neil Wilson of ETX Capital on today\u2019s market moves: There\u2019s something of the Trump bump about all this. For instance, rising copper prices are a sign that global growth is turning positive off the back of his expected reflationary policies. But another leading indicator, the Baltic Dry Index, has slumped of late, a signal that fears of protectionist policies are very high. It\u2019s a mixed picture for miners and uncertain for sure. BHP Billiton was up nearly 2% as it looks set to benefit from rising metal prices. Fresnillo edged lower despite reporting record annual silver and gold production, as prices for the two metals slipped. Shares in UK eateries group Restaurant Group have slumped by 10% this morning, after another disappointing trading update. The company, which runs Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s. Garfunkel\u2019s, Brunning &amp; Price, Chiquito and other chains, posted a 3.9% drop in like-for-like sales. It also predicted a \u2018difficult\u2019 trading performance over the next six months, as it tries to shake up its offerings to tempt customers Restaurant Group also admitted that the slump in the pound will drive up input costs, and said the apprenticeship levy, proposed increases in business rates and higher energy taxes will bring extra cost pressures. Oof!! Confidence among German executives has weakened to a five-month low. The IFO survey of German business confidence has missed forecasts, falling to 109.8 this month from 111 in December. Economists expected a small rise to 111.3 Clemens Fuest, head of the IFO economic institute, says German firms are happy with the current situation, but less optimistic about the outlook over the next six months. At times like this, we all need a laugh. And strong sales of spoof humour books and growing customer numbers at airport shops gave WH Smith reason for cheer in its latest trading update. A comic revival of Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five characters helped to lift like-for-like sales 1% at the retailer over the 21 weeks to 21 January, with Five on Brexit Island and Five Give up the Booze among the best-sellers. Sales at its network of shops in travel locations such as motorway service stations and airports were up 5%, but down 3% at its shops on UK high streets. The retailer, which this year celebrates its 225th birthday, said that strong sales of spoof humour books and seasonal stationery were offset by year-on-year sales figures for adult colouring books that were tough to beat, having sold really well over the same period last year. Chief executive Stephen Clarke sounded a broadly positive note: \u201cAs a result of the performance in travel we expect group profit growth for the year to be slightly ahead of plan. \u201cWhile there is some uncertainty in the broader economic environment, we remain confident that the group is well positioned for the year ahead as we continue to focus on profitable growth, cash generation and investing in new opportunities.\u201d And the verdict from veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb? \u201cAlthough the comparisons were tough, the business has come through well. How far the 225th Anniversary celebrations of the company help trade this year remains to be seen, but the City will be relieved by the strong Christmas trading performance.\u201d Shares were up 7.6% at \u00a315.93 in early trading, making the retailer the biggest riser on the FTE 250 in early trading. The Mexican Peso has weakened by 0.15% today, to 21.56 peso to the US dollar. It\u2019s suffering from president Trump\u2019s threat to erect a wall on the US-Mexico border. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Trump tweets continue to drive sentiment and the President\u2019s most recent - \u201cBig day planned fort NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among other things, we will build the wall!\u201d - saw the Mexican peso reverse Monday/Tuesday gains. German government bond prices are falling this morning, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on bunds to a six-week high. That shows that investors are moving money out of safe-haven assets and into shares. The pound is holding firm at $1.252 this morning, as the City waits for the government to publish its bill on exiting the European Union. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has gained almost 1% this morning, putting it on track for its biggest gain of 2017. Solid earning figures from Santander, which posted a 4% increase in revenue, are helping the mood. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has gained nearly 0.7% this morning, as it gains 48 points to 7199. Mining group Antofagasta is leading the rally, up over 5%, after reporting a solid production report. Other miners are also on the up because commodity prices are bouncing ahead, on hopes of a US spending boost from Trump. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says this strength in base metals is driving the markets up. Copper in particular up on restricted supply (BHP Billiton cut guidance; prolonged strikes could make matters worse) and growth/inflation expectations from US infrastructure spending plans as Trump sticks to his campaign hymn sheet. Aluminium, Iron Ore, Lead and Zinc are all tagging along while Oil holds around $53/55, near the mid-point of a $50-60 range as US production increases challenge OPEC cuts. Traders have a lot to fret about right now, from Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist threats to Britain\u2019s push towards Brexit. But today, shares are rising on optimism that the global economy may strengthen this year, as Trump starts to delivers on fiscal stimulus boost he promised during his campaign. Last night, America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices both hit new record highs, as Trump controversially approved two energy projects. This pushed shares up on Wall Street, as Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, told CNBC: \u201cI think the real lift in the market was the second round of executive orders from the White House. This is very much a Trump-infrastructure rally.\u201d This has fed through to Asia where most markets rallied, with Japan\u2019s Topix index up 1%. There\u2019s a positive start in Europe too, with the main markets gaining ground in early trading. Donald Trump has alarmed many observers with his early moves as president, with environmentalists aghast that he is reviving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. But in the cold-hearted world of the markets, the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 is back on, as Kathleen Brooks of City Index puts it. US stock markets have showed renewed signs of life this week, and the Nasdaq made a fresh record high on Tuesday as the market toyed with the idea of reigniting the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 that we saw in the aftermath of the presidential election last November. Based on Tuesday\u2019s performance, it looks like the market is happy with the first flourish of Trump\u2019s executive orders. History suggests that there could be further upside for stocks.... Trump also advanced the Keystone Pipeline project on Tuesday, something that President Obama slapped down. These first steps may not please climate change activists, but, as expected, they suggest that President Trump is \u2018business friendly\u2019 and the markets are greeting this with approval. Thus, stocks are in a strong position as we move to the middle of the week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up today. 9am GMT: German IFO confidence report for January, showing how optimistic business leaders in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy are this month. 11am: CBI Industrial trends survey, showing how Britain\u2019s factories are faring 3.30pm: US crude oil inventory figures 4pm: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking at a banking conference in Wiesbaden, Germany.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth.

What\u2019s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth.</p> <p>The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u2019s flash crash.

                "bodyText":"In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average may have continued to head higher in early trading following Wednesday\u2019s long-awaited breach of the 20,000 barrier, but the picture was less clear in Europe. Some support was given by Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s $30bn deal to buy Swiss biotech firm Actelion, but some mixed results from the likes of Unilever and Sage (badly received) and Diageo (positive) left markets struggling for direction. In the event only Germany\u2019s Dax managed to end the day in positive territory although the declines elsewhere were limited. In the UK the pound dipped on continuing concerns about Brexit, despite better than expected GDP figures, but the FTSE 100 failed to take advantage. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped 2.94 points or 0.04% to 7161.49 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.36% to 11,848.63 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.21% to 4867.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 19,439.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9512.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 660.59 On Wall Street the Dow is currently up 28 points at 20,096. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. News that Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.has called off a proposed meeting with Donald Trump next week as the two side argue about who should pay for the new US president\u2019s infamous wall plan has hit the Mexican currency: The pound continues to be weaker, slipping back from its six week highs. Despite the better than expected UK GDP figures, concerns about the evenutal outcome of Brexit have helped push sterling down 0.49% against the dollar to $1.2568. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The unenthusiastic reaction by currency traders [to the UK GDP figures] reflects a sense that this could be as good as it gets for UK growth. So far the only major fallout from the EU referendum has been the drop in the pound which will inevitably feed through to higher prices and act as headwind to consumer spending. Markets are forward-discounting mechanisms, and while the growth was faster than expected, it\u2019s already well-understood the much lamented Brexit slowdown never happened. By that token, it\u2019s also evident the Bank of England was completely wrong-footed by the resilience of the UK economy. What\u2019s less clear is the extent to which markets will be self-correcting. If the pound recovers under a more neutral outlook for UK rates, the resulting inflation will not be as strong and not such a headwind to growth. The data came at time when a rise in political certainty has carried the pound to close to its highest since October\u2019s flash crash. It\u2019s still politics (not economic growth) that is the driving force for sterling. Another set of US data, this time showing a sharp fall in home sales in December after three months of strong gains. New single family home sales fell by 10.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month, a ten month low. November\u2019s figure was revised up from 592,000 to 598,000. Economists had expected a fall, but only 1% to around 588.000. The positive US service sector figures come after news earlier this week than manufacturing was also performing well in January, and together they point to further Federal Reserve interest rises, said survey compiler IHS Markit. Chris Williamson, its chief business economist, said: The improvement in service sector business conditions follows the news earlier in the week that manufacturing also enjoyed a bumper start to the year. The two PMI surveys collectively point to the economy growing at an annualised rate of just over 2.5% in January, and puts the US on a strong footing to achieve faster growth in 2017. IHS Markit currently forecasts that the US economy will grow by 2.3% in 2017, up from 1.6% in 2016. Although the strong dollar is hitting exports, domestic demand clearly remains buoyant. Companies reported one of the highest inflows of new business for a year and a half as demand lifted higher at the start of 2017. Job creation also remained encouragingly solid, and especially impressive given current high overall levels of employment in the economy. Job gains are linked to increased optimism about the economic outlook. Business expectations of future growth are at their highest for just over one and a half years. The strong start to 2017 and bullish mood for the year ahead adds to our expectation that we will see the Fed hike rates a further three times in 2017. The US services sector has performed slightly better than expected in January, according to initial estimates. Markit\u2019s flash service sector PMI came in at 55.1, up from 53.9 in December and higher than the forecast figure of 54.4. The composite index - which includes services and manufacturing - was 55.4, up from 54.1 in December. Earlier the advance goods trade balance dipped from -$65.3bn to -$65. After Wednesday\u2019s record breaking run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged through the 20,000 barrier for the first time, US markets have opened the new trading day on a positive note. The Dow is up 21 points at 20,089 , while both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have hit new highs, albeit with marginal percentage gains so far. The moves come despite a mixed bag of company results, with Caterpillar and Whirlpool issuing disappointing numbers but cable operator Comcast and eBay both pleasing the market with their latest updates. Just in: More Americans than expected signed on for jobless benefits last week. The closely watched Initial Claims figure rose to 259,000 in the seven days to January 21st (the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration), from 237,000 the previous week. Economists had expected a smaller rise, to 247,000. The number of Americans who remained on unemployment support also picked up. Called the \u2018continued claims\u2019 figure, it rose to 2.1 million, from 2.059 million the week before. Over in America, construction and equipment giant Caterpillar has surprised Wall Street by posting a 13% drop in sales in the last three months. Caterpillar, seen as a bellwether for global growth, was also cautious about its prospects, warning that the \u201coverall environment remains challenging\u201d. Time for a recap, with links to the key points in the blog Britain\u2019s economy has beaten expectations by posting growth of 0.6% in the final three months of last year. Service sector companies provided the growth, while pharmaceuticals firms helped UK manufacturing to expand. But construction only grew 0.1% and industrial production was flat. Here are the details: The Office for National Statistics said the economy ended 2016 with \u201csteady growth\u201d. Chancellor Philip Hammond said Britain is well-positioned to handle \u2018uncertainty\u2019 this year. But the TUC is worried that real incomes will be squeezed this year as inflation rises. The figures are the latest sign that Britain\u2019s economy has not been knocked off course by last June\u2019s EU referendum. GDP growth over the second half of 2016 was faster than in the first six months. Here\u2019s what people are saying about that. This means Britain was probably the fastest growing G7 economy this year - that will be confirmed once we get GDP from the US, the eurozone, Canada and Japan in the coming days. However, growth was less impressive on a per-capita basis, adjusting for increases in population. Here are some good charts. Several economists expect growth to slow this year. Personal finance experts say families need to get ready now. The pound has fallen back from this morning\u2019s six-week highs, and is now trading around $1.256, a fall of 0.5%. This morning\u2019s decent growth figures should have supported sterling, but instead traders are worrying about Brexit again. So says Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com, who writes: This morning\u2019s UK GDP figures surprised to the upside, yet the pound failed to respond positively to the news as it suffered in a typical \u201cbuy the rumour, sell the fact\u201d type of a reaction, except that there were no rumours per se. Sterling has been appreciating noticeably in recent days as traders continued to unwind their Brexit trades \u2013 until today. The economic outlook for the UK remains bleak even if the Brexit vote itself hasn\u2019t had any material impact on the economy yet. The pound would do very well to get back to $1.40s again. The full impact of Brexit will not be felt for months \u2013 or even years \u2013 but the uncertainty will most likely prevent sterling from appreciating significantly in the interim. So get used to seeing see more chop and churn in GBP for the foreseeable future. Personal finance experts are urging families to get ready for a financial squeeze in 2017, as higher inflation eats into household incomes. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk says: \u201cIt\u2019s a real relief to see the economy has proved resilient against the Brexit backdrop, this puts us in a solid position to navigate the uncertain year ahead. Households haven\u2019t been scared out of spending by doom and gloom projections of life outside of the EU and this has really helped to push growth forward. \u201cMy biggest concern right now is how households will cope with rising costs over the coming year. Already two thirds of working households say they\u2019re just about managing to make their money stretch and with few having enough savings to back them up, lots of people will feel the pinch. There\u2019s a real risk this could impact growth. \u201cIt\u2019s really worth everyone giving their bank balance a health check now. Knowing how much you have coming in each month, checking where your money is going and looking at how you can make simple savings is the best way to make sure you can cope as life gets more expensive.\u201d And here\u2019s Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u2019s savings specialist: The cheaper pound may be bad news for those queuing at the checkout, as rising import costs push up prices, but it provides new opportunities for UK exporters and a boost for the UK tourism industry. We mustn\u2019t let the UK\u2019s strong economic output mask the issues facing Brits up and down the country. Consumers are already battling rising food, transport and energy costs, and with an interest rate rise also possible in 2017, households will find little comfort in the macro-economic picture. Even so, people shouldn\u2019t cut back on putting money aside if they can. Building a nest egg and having the comfort of a lump sum to fall back on is invaluable when money starts to tighten.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond has told City reporters not to expect a thrilling budget in March: If the Remain Campaign\u2019s warnings had been accurate, this is the day that Britain would have officially entered recession. But rather than two quarters of contraction, today\u2019s figures show the economy actually grew by 1.2% in the last six months after the EU referendum. Of course, Britain hasn\u2019t triggered Article 50 yet, let alone actually leave the EU. But our economics editor Larry Elliott thinks there\u2019s more to it than that: A better explanation for the robust performance of the economy is that consumers have carried on spending. The factors that underpinned domestic demand ahead of the referendum \u2013 low unemployment, rising house prices and rock-bottom interest rates \u2013 are still in place. The Bank\u2019s decision to cut rates and to deliver another dollop of quantitative easing in August has, if anything, created even more growth-friendly conditions. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s numbers, following a meeting with Philip Hammond at Microsoft\u2019s HW. Joanna Partridge of ITV News flags up that Britain probably outperformed its major rivals last year. US GDP figures are released on Friday, followed by eurozone growth figures next Tuesday. Brexit uncertainty is likely to dampen growth this year, according to several City experts, despite the resilient growth in the last three months of 2016. Here\u2019s Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC: \u201cStrong consumer spending has supported growth over the past three months and this has more than offset the dampening impact of Brexit uncertainty in investment. As a result, the services sector has continued to be the driving force for the UK economy in recent quarters. The world economy has also helped economic growth with positive indicators in all the main economic regions - Europe, North America and Asia. \u201c2017 will be a more testing year for the UK economy as consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation. Despite this, we should expect the underlying resilience of the UK economy and healthy global growth to support economic activity in the year ahead. That should enable GDP to grow by close to 1.5% in 2017 even though Brexit uncertainties will have a dampening effect.\u201d This is from Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cFar from plunging into recession after the vote to leave the EU, the UK was actually the fastest growing G7 economy in 2016. GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2016, faster than expected. This included strong contributions from consumer-focused activities, business services and finance. \u201cLooking ahead to 2017, the major question is whether a squeeze on real household incomes, and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the corporate sector, will be offset by the benefits of cheaper sterling against a stronger backdrop of global economic growth.\u201d Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, also sees a slowdown this year. \u201cChallenges abound for forecasters in 2017, but we\u2019d caution against complacency. Consumers won\u2019t be ramping up spending thanks to rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, and businesses\u2019 appetite to sign off big investments will depend on how they view the progress of Brexit negotiations. There\u2019s every chance that this rate of expansion is the high point for the next couple of years Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School, is worried that consumers are relying on borrowing: Several people are pointing out that there\u2019s no sign that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has hurt the economy (yet anyway). This is from Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank: The first 6 months since the Brexit vote have seen growth of almost 2.5% annualised, which is above trend. Clearly, life goes on, despite the Brexit vote. There isn\u2019t an awful lot of detail in the breakdown at this stage. But what we do have shows that services output continues to do all the heavy lifting, while construction output remains the problem child of the UK economy. Here\u2019s columnist Matthew Lynn: Dr Gerald Lyons, former advisor to Boris Johnson, reckons the EU vote - and the interest rate cut by the Bank of England - actually helped the economy. Here\u2019s journalist and BBC presenter Andrew Neil: But.... Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, believes a slowdown is coming: \u201cThe latest retail sales data shows a slowdown in spending, and inflation is only just beginning to bite. Businesses now also have a clearer picture of the path of Brexit, so investment behaviour is likely to change in 2017. \u201cThis all adds up to a potential slowdown in the economy this year - the Bank of England\u2019s gloom about the economic consequences of Brexit could well prove justified in the end, despite the cheery tone of this morning\u2019s data.\u201d Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation is tweeting some interesting GDP charts. This shows how the recovery since the 2008 crash has been much slower than earlier recessions, on a GDP-per-capita basis (growth divided by population). But overall, Britain has done better than its European rivals: Here\u2019s a recording of Bobby Kennedy\u2019s famous speech on the problems with GDP, from 1968. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is worried that workers will suffer in 2017, if wages don\u2019t keep pace with inflation: \u201cOur economy may have been resilient in the face of the Brexit vote, but GDP growth is stuck in the slow lane. And people are still feeling the financial crisis in their pockets. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for government complacency. 2017 will be a challenging year, so ministers can\u2019t let us sleep walk into another living standards crisis. \u201cWorking people mustn\u2019t be forced to pay the price for Brexit. March\u2019s budget must set out a plan to boost wages, and seriously invest in developing our infrastructure and public services.\u201d The 0.7% jump in manufacturing output last quarter is mainly due to a large rise in the erratically performing pharmaceuticals industry. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that Britain\u2019s service sector has been dominant for decades now: Chancellor Philip Hammond has welcomed today\u2019s growth figures, but warned that the economy still faces uncertainty. He says: \u201cEvery major sector of the economy grew last year, which is further evidence of the fundamental strength and resilience of the UK economy. There may be uncertainty ahead as we adjust to a new relationship with Europe, but we are ready to seize the opportunities to create a competitive economy that works for all.\u201d Hammond is visiting Microsoft\u2019s HQ in Reading to discuss the economy, so we should hear more from him later... Digging into the GDP report, we can see that Britain\u2019s retail sector was fastest growing part of the economy. That\u2019s a worry, as it suggests the UK is still reliant on consumer spending (often on imports) rather than a strong manufacturing base. And if households do cut back in 2017, retail will take a hit. Darren Morgan, the head of GDP at the ONS, says Britain\u2019s economy ended last year with \u201csteady growth\u201d. \u201cStrong consumer spending supported the expansion of the dominant services sector and although manufacturing bounced back from a weaker third quarter, both it and construction remained broadly unchanged over the year as a whole.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has now enjoyed four years of uninterrupted growth. It is now 8.7% higher than its pre-crisis peak in 2008. But on a per capita basis (adjusted for population changes), it\u2019s only 1.9% larger. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by 0.7% during the last quarter, nearly as fast as the services sector. Britain\u2019s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, expanding by 0.8%, while construction and industrial output lagged behind (again). Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s GDP report: Growth during Quarter 4 was dominated by services, with a strong contribution from consumer-focused industries such as retail sales and travel agency services. Following falls in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, construction and production provided negligible positive contributions to GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016. UK GDP was estimated to have increased by 2.0% during 2016, slowing slightly from 2.2% in 2015 and from 3.1% in 2014. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.4% during Quarter 4 2016 and by 1.3% during 2016. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% in the last quarter - stronger than the 2.1% growth expected. Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy expanded by 0.6% in the final three months of 2016. That\u2019s stronger than the 0.5% expected by City economists. It matches the growth in the July-September, and shows little sign of any Brexit impact on the UK economy. Five minutes to go! Economists have already warned that the UK economy will slow in 2017, even if last year ended on a high note. The fall in the pound will drive up inflation thus year, eating into household disposable income and ultimately meaning slower growth, according to some City experts. More here: Over in the City, drinks giant Diageo said it had benefited from the slide in the pound against the US dollar and the euro since the Brexit vote. It is estimated to have boosted net sales by about \u00a31.4bn and operating profits by \u00a3460m in the year to 30 June. The maker of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Smirnoff vodka toasted a 28% rise in first-half operating profits to \u00a32.06bn and hiked its interim dividend by 5%. Diageo\u2019s shares rose 4.8% on the news. Unilever fared less well. Its shares slid more than 4% after the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant posted lower-than-expected sales growth of 2.2% for the fourth quarter. It blamed Brazil\u2019s weak economy along with India\u2019s move to withdraw high-value rupee notes to fight corruption. Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters that its European prices were starting to move up again after price deflation in many countries \u2013 partly due to price hikes pushed through in the UK to counteract impact of the weaker pound on the company\u2019s costs. The price rises led to a public spat with Tesco last year, known as Marmitegate. We shouldn\u2019t forge that GDP is a somewhat flawed measure - notable for what it omits, as well as what it includes. GDP is calculated by adding up all the money spent and earned in an economy, and the value of the goods and services produced. That gives a measure of the size of the economy, which you can divide by the population total to get GDP per capita. But it doesn\u2019t include, for example, unpaid work by carers. It doesn\u2019t consider the environmental damage caused by economic growth. Inequality isn\u2019t factored in, nor is the fact that the Internet means we now get many services for free, where once we paid for them. In short, it doesn\u2019t show if life is better or worse. Bobby Kennedy summed GDP up wonderfully in 1968, three months before he was assassinated, when he said: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. Britain\u2019s service sector makes up almost 80% of the economy; this chart from Bloomberg shows how it has provided most of the growth in the last three years: Sterling has hit a new six-week high, as traders await the UK GDP figures in an hour\u2019s time. One pound is now worth $1.266, its highest level since 14 December. The Treasury have published a guide to GDP: It concludes that: GDP matters because it shows how healthy the economy is Rising GDP means the economy is growing, and the resources available to people in the country \u2013 goods and services, wages and profits \u2013 are increasing. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets predict that the UK economy ended 2016 in solid shape, after a wobble in October. News on economic output was very weak for October (the service sector aside) but the November story saw a reversal for the production sector at least. Together with strong survey evidence for December that prompted us recently to revise up our Q4 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% q/q as a robust contribution from the service sector is expected once again. Today\u2019s GDP figures may show if the prospect of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 has hurt the economy. The fourth quarter of 2016 began with prime minister Theresa May pledging to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017, and making immigration control a top priority. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: We should remember that the prospect of a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 only raised its head in October, so there could be an even larger decline in business investment in the final three months of the year Although this may have no bearing on growth right now, it is likely to impact GDP levels and confidence levels at some point in 2017, so a sharp decline in this figure is worth noting. Good morning. It\u2019s time for another healthcheck on the UK economy, as we press on towards triggering Article 50 and leaving the EU. At 9.30am, new GDP figures will be released showing how Britain performed between October and December 2016. This was a busy time, dominated by the Brexit debate and Donald Trump winning the US election. Did this drama and uncertainty hit the economy, or were consumers and businesses undaunted? Economists are expecting another quarter of solid growth, with GDP expanding by 0.5%. That would be a slight slowdown on the 0.6% recorded between July and September, but well away from the the recession some predicted if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u2019s figures are only preliminary, so we won\u2019t get too much information about the state of the economy. But it will give a breakdown by sector, so we can see if the service sector continued to drive growth, and whether manufacturers are being helped by the weak pound. Also coming up today: Stock markets are expected to rise, after the US Dow Jones index smashed through 20,000 yesterday. Daily Mail and General Trust, Unilever, Sky, Whitbread, Jimmy Choo and Diageo are all reporting results. There\u2019s also a flurry of excitement in the City as Royal Bank of Scotland announces it\u2019s setting aside another \u00a33.1bn to cover the cost of misselling toxic bonds. Will it never end?....",

Under Obama, the US managed to avoid a second Great Depression and embarked on a somewhat lacklustre recovery starting in 2010. But, although the economy added a fair amount of jobs and the economic situation of many US households has improved considerably after the crisis, some downsides remain. </p> <p>Notably, the labour force participation rate has failed to pick up in line with what would be expected during the recovery of a sharp recession. Moreover, the US economy - similarly to the situation in the UK \u2013 is ailing from slow productivity growth. Most importantly, it seems that much of the increase in wages and job opportunities of the last six years has intensified already existing inequalities in the country.</p> <p>In terms of Mr Trump\u2019s economic policy programme, it is still unclear whether the administration will go ahead with the announced boost to infrastructure spending and additional tax cuts.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments below the line. Have a good weekend. AM Kay Daniel Neufeld at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, looks back at the US economy under President Obama: The mixed picture for GDP growth in 2016 has been characteristic of the economic performance of the outgoing Obama administration. Under Obama, the US managed to avoid a second Great Depression and embarked on a somewhat lacklustre recovery starting in 2010. But, although the economy added a fair amount of jobs and the economic situation of many US households has improved considerably after the crisis, some downsides remain. Notably, the labour force participation rate has failed to pick up in line with what would be expected during the recovery of a sharp recession. Moreover, the US economy - similarly to the situation in the UK \u2013 is ailing from slow productivity growth. Most importantly, it seems that much of the increase in wages and job opportunities of the last six years has intensified already existing inequalities in the country. In terms of Mr Trump\u2019s economic policy programme, it is still unclear whether the administration will go ahead with the announced boost to infrastructure spending and additional tax cuts. If so we expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the second quarter of 2017 at the latest. The FTSE 100 is the only major European index making gains this afternoon, albeit small ones (up 8 points). Tesco is still the biggest riser, with shares up 10.5%. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,170 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 11,822 France\u2019s CAC: -0.6% at 4,840 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 19,308 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 9,478 Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research is fairly positive about the outlook for the American economy. We think that the economy is on track to expand by 2% to 2.25% in the first half of the year. Under the assumption that the new administration will pass a fiscal stimulus in time without derailing global trade, growth in the second half of 2017 will most likely be faster. US markets have opened (very) slightly higher: Dow Jones: +0.01% at 20,103 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,299 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,667 Ian Kernohan, economist at fund manager Royal London Asset Management, said the US economy could grow by more than 3% by 2018. US GDP growth was estimated at 1.9% on an annualised basis in the final quarter of 2016, and just 1.6% for the calendar year. However, this relatively slow expansion was still sufficient to drive employment levels higher and unemployment lower, leading to a pick-up in wage growth. Going forward, much will depend on the scale and timing of any fiscal stimulus by the new Trump administration, which could push US GDP growth to over 3% by 2018. We do not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again until May, when they will have greater visibility on the new administration\u2019s plans. US growth in 2016 overall was 1.6%, the slowest since 2011 and far weaker than the 2.6% growth achieved in 2015. It was also a slower rate than the UK, which grew by 2% in 2016 - probably faster than any other G7 economy (we haven\u2019t got all the figures yet). Here is our full story on the US figures: IG traders expect US markets to open higher Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the slowdown in US growth will not deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in March. Q4 GDP of 1.9% is not a bad figure, when taken together with the unrevised 3.5% growth in Q3, and suggests that the US economy picked up momentum in the second half of the year. With few shocks in the data, the main source of interest we think is the business investment figure, which rose by 3.1% (annualised quarter on quarter), following four quarters of declines. Fed hawks will take heart from this data. This is another clue that markets are still too cautious with respect to the timing of the next Fed rate hike. We see few reasons why the Fed should wait until June, and look for a March hike. Growth in the world\u2019s largest economy was held back in the fourth quarter by plunging shipments of soybeans, which in turn dragged exports lower. Household spending was a key driver of the 1.9% headline rate of economic growth, the US department of commerce said. Worth pointing out that the US quarterly growth figures are annual rates... Alternatively... Breaking: Growth in the US slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 1.9% from 3.5% in the third quarter. Economists predicted growth of 2.2%. More soon. Growth in the world\u2019s largest economy slowed to 2.2% in the final quarter of 2016, from 3.5% in the third, figures out in less than an hour are expected to show. It will provide investors with a steer on what shape the economy was in as Obama handed Trump the keys to the White House. Failure to break the impasse of deadlocked bailout talks at Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting saw the Athens Stock Exchange shed 2.9% today with bank shares plummeting by more than 5%. The next tranche of emergency funding from Greece\u2019s third \u20ac86bn bailout hinges on the conclusion of a review by creditors of Greek progress on reforms. If the funds are not released, a re-run of the Greek debt crisis looms. Athens has to meet around \u20ac10.5bn in debt repayments as of July \u2013 money it currently does not have. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government has been keen to wrap up the review so that Greece can join the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme \u2013 viewed as essential if Greece is to regain access to international capital markets. But to do this Tsipras will have to agree to imposing more austerity once the current aid programme expires in mid 2018. As eurozone finance ministers met, the International Monetary Fund reiterated its belief that Greek debt is unsustainable, predicting it would become \u201cexplosive\u201d after 2030. In Greece, fears of euro expulsion and fresh elections are growing. Either Tsipras bows to demands at a time when his government\u2019s popularity has nosedived, or he calls early polls ushering in a period of renewed uncertainty for the EU\u2019s weakest member state. Greek shares are down today after lack of progress between Greece and its fellow eurozone members at Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem called on Greece to move faster on reforms so that its creditors\u2019 could return to Athens as soon as possible and resume negotiations about the next tranche of funding. The Athens stock exchange is down 2.9%, with banking stocks the biggest fallers: Sticking with currencies, the European Central Bank has revealed that it withdrew about \u20ac17,000 worth of fake \u20ac500 bank notes from circulation in the second half of 2016. The latest figures from the ECB show that almost 4.9% of the \u20ac353,000 withdrawn were \u20ac500 notes. The ECB said: Some 353,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the second half of 2016, a slight increase compared with the first half of 2016 and 20.7% fewer than in the second half of 2015. The number of counterfeits remains very low in comparison with the increasing number of genuine banknotes in circulation (over 19 billion during the second half of 2016). The vast majority of counterfeits were \u20ac20 and \u20ac50 notes, accounting for 80%. The ECB has already announced that it will scrap the \u20ac500 note over fears that the high denomination notes are used to finance crime. The pound has slipped from a five-week high this morning but is still on track for a weekly gain. Investors have been encouraged by better-than-expected growth figures which showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2016. The pound is currently down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2539. The number of individuals to be declared financially bust in 2013 rose 13% in 2016 to 90,930 (from 80,404). The figures from the government\u2019s Insolvency Service cover England and Wales. It was the first rise in six years. \u201cIt is very distressing to live with unsustainable personal debt so it is important for people to seek advice\u201d, said Sarah Albon, chief executive of the service. National Debtline which provides free advice online and over the phone, said the figures point to tougher times ahead for families. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust which runs National Debtline, said: While the government is rightly focused on those who are \u2018just about managing\u2019, these figures are a reminder that a smaller but growing number of households are not managing at all. The rise in insolvencies in 2016 points to tougher times ahead for UK households. At National Debtline we are already seeing our busiest January in years, with calls up 17% on last January and a rise of 55% in the number people seeking advice online. With household debt levels growing significantly and inflation now beginning to rise, we expect demand for debt advice to continue to be significantly higher this year than last. Not much sympathy for BT from blog readers commenting below the line... but shares are not suffering too much this morning, off 0.5%. That said, they did fall off a cliff on Tuesday, down 21% wiping almost \u00a38bn off the value of the company after the extent of the problems in Italy were laid bare. The share price graph tells the story: Over in France, households don\u2019t appear to be concerned about uncertainty surrounding elections, Brexit, the future of the eurozone, or anything else. Consumer confidence hit the a nine-year high in January according to the official statistics agency, Insee. The headline index hit 100 for the first time since November 2007. Julien Manceaux, ING senior economist covering France, says the upturn in sentiment and other positive indicators would be encouraging for the next French president. It is the first time since 2007 that French consumers have been that positive about the future. Consumer confidence has been improving since mid-2014, but it took until recently to see all components improving. In January, consumers were particularly optimistic on the future of unemployment and on their purchase intentions, although their current capacity to save remains limited. All in all, if this is another significant improvement (business confidence rebounded as well and industrial production was remarkably strong in the fourth quarter of 2016), there is still some way to go before to label it a full-speed recovery. However, these more positive signs have been awaited for a long time. If they are too late to save President Hollande\u2019s legacy, they are a strong starting point for the next French president. Here is our full story on the latest from BT, including a 37% slump in third-quarter profits. Investors are clearly happy about Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn deal with Booker. Tesco shares are now up almost 10%. Booker shares are up 16%. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Tesco is taking \u201ca bold new direction\u201d. The deal with Booker shows Tesco is not going to sit on its hands and wait for its dominant market position to slowly leak away to competitors. The UK\u2019s supermarkets are engaged in new strategies to cope with the brave new world, where the discounters have stolen market share and consumers have turned away from big superstores, preferring instead to do their shopping in convenience stores or on their mobile phones. Sainsbury bought Argos, Morrisons is flirting with Amazon, and now Tesco has revealed its plans to drive further growth. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, says the deal is likely to come under scrutiny from the competition regulator: Our instant reaction is that the Competition and Markets Authority will have a field day with this, as although Tesco is mainly a retailer in the UK and Booker a wholesaler, Tesco does own the One Stop convenience store chain that competes with Booker\u2019s interest in symbol groups and convenience store retailing (via Premier and Londis etc), so it is by no means clear that the CMA will allow things to proceed very far without having a good look at the overlap. The mystery behind Richard Cousins\u2019 departure from Tesco has been solved... Cousins, the chief executive of catering group Compass, quit as senior independent director of Tesco on 3 January just days before the supermarket chain revealed its Christmas trading figures. Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive confirmed today that Cousins resigned because he didn\u2019t agree with the Booker deal. Lewis described the discussions as \u201cgood governance\u201d and said he respected Cousins\u2019 decision. The rest of the board was behind the deal, he added. The John Lewis Partnership and pension trustee have agreed a 10-year plan to eliminate the pension deficit. John Lewis reduced its defined benefit pension scheme to \u00a3479m (as at 31 March 2016), from a previous valuation of \u00a3840m. The plan to eliminate the deficit includes a \u00a3303m cash contribution from the company, of which \u00a3183m is due to be paid before the end of March 2017. Gavin Patterson, BT\u2019s chief executive, has commented on what the accounting scandal might mean for his pay package (\u00a35.3m last year): [The issue is] for another day. That\u2019s that then.. Some more comments from BT boss Gavin Patterson. He has told reporters that while shareholders have a right to be angry about the accounting scandal in its Italian business, the situation was now under control: Frankly I am angry that the integrity of BT has been undermined by the wrongdoing of a few individuals in one part of the business. The situation is now under control, we have already appointed new management and as you would expect we are proactively providing assistance for the Italian authorities. We mustn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that BT is in good health overall. BT shares are down about 0.4%. The company has already said it will look at executive pay in light of the improper behaviour in Italy. Patterson earned \u00a35.3m last year including an annual bonus of just over \u00a31m and share awards worth \u00a33m. The finance director, Tony Chanmugam, who was already due to step down in July, received \u00a32.8m, including a \u00a3587,000 bonus. Philip Hammond, UK chancellor, has arrived in Brussels for the Ecofin meeting of finance ministers. He told reporters that Britain will respect its obligations under European Union rules as its seeks to strengthen trade ties around the world. It comes as Theresa May prepares to meet US President Trump later today, with a UK/US trade deal expected to be high on the agenda. Hammond said in Brussels: Of course we want to strengthen our trade ties with the very many trade partners we have around the world. But we are very mindful of our obligations under the treaty and will follow them precisely. Britain remains a fully engaged member of the European Union. We will continue to abide by the rules, regulations and the laws of the European Union for so long as we are members. Most of Europe\u2019s major markets are down in early trading. The FTSE 100 is the exception, but only just (up 5 points): FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,167 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 11,828 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 4,853 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 19,400 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,485 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 367 Tesco is at the top of the FTSE 100 leader board with shares up 8.3% after it revealed plans to by the food wholesaler, Booker, in a \u00a33.7bn deal. Back to Tesco\u2019s deal to buy Booker... Tesco\u2019s chief executive Dave Lewis had this to say (he\u2019s calling it a merger): Tesco has made significant progress in turning around our UK retail business. This merger with Booker will further enhance Tesco\u2019s growth prospects by creating the UK\u2019s leading food business with combined expertise in retail, wholesale, supply chain and digital. Wherever food is prepared and eaten - \u2018in home\u2019 or \u2018out of home\u2019 - we will meet this opportunity with the widest choice and best service available. Booker says it is the UK\u2019s biggest food wholesaler, serving a total of 1.3m customers. Customers are varied, and include the prison service in England and Wales, Marks &amp; Spencer and most of the cinema chains in the UK. Here is our full story on the deal: Also coming up... Finance ministers of the European Union are gathering for the latest Ecofin meeting. We\u2019ll bring you any interesting snippets from the sidelines. And it\u2019s GDP day in the US! At 13.30 UK time we\u2019ll get fourth-quarter growth figures from the world\u2019s largest economy. They will be Obama\u2019s sign-off, as Michael Hewson from CMC markets explains: Today\u2019s first iteration of US Q4 GDP will be the final legacy of the Obama Presidency, and the economy that he has left for the new incumbent. How the US economy performs from here will largely be down to Donald Trump, even if Obama laid the foundations. Expectations are for a modest slowdown from the 3.5% growth seen in Q3 to 2.2%. A large part of this slowdown is likely to be as a result of lower exports, given that the high Q3 number was boosted by a large jump in soybean exports, due to a shortage in South America. This isn\u2019t likely to be repeated, while personal consumption is also expected to come in lower. Traders at IG in the City are predicting markets will open lower across Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some major corporate news this morning from two of the UK\u2019s biggest firms. BT has revealed that Corrado Sciolla, head of its continental Europe business, is leaving after an accounting scandal in the Italian business wiped almost \u00a38bn off the company\u2019s value on Tuesday. According to Reuters, BT put it plainly: Corrado is leaving the business, this happened on his watch. Announcing third quarter results this morning, BT\u2019s chief executive Gavin Patterson said: We\u2019ve undertaken extensive investigations into our Italian business, including an independent review by KPMG, and I am deeply disappointed with the unacceptable practices by some that we\u2019ve found. This has no place at BT, and it undermines the good work we\u2019re doing elsewhere in the Group. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT. In other news, Tesco is buying the food wholesaler Booker in a \u00a33.7bn deal. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain said that buying Booker, which owns Budgens and Londis, would help speed up the turnaround of Tesco (was hit by its own accounting scandal a couple of years ago). More on both stories soon.",

In the UK, the FTSE 100 lost all the gains made so far this year, closing at its lowest level since 28 December. Things would have been worse without a boost from Vodafone after the mobile phone group said it was in talks about merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market narrative has shifted once again. For the past three months a Trump presidency has been heralded as great for stocks. Now, with Dow 20,000 behind us, it seems his government can be blamed for the bout of selling that has engulfed markets. The truth, as ever, probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there is probably some truth in the idea that geopolitical jitters are playing a part in price action today. The FTSE 100 has now surrendered all its gains for the year...Markets overall have been ripe for a correction for some time now, and were merely in need of a reason to begin; Trump\u2019s rambunctious opening to his presidency, and the lighter volumes caused by holidays in Asian markets, may well have provided the bears with the opening they needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.92% or 66.01 points at 7118.48</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.12% to 11,681.89</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.14% at 4784.64</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.95% to 18,759.40</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.5% lower at 9361.3</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.53% to 614.08</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 183 points or 0.92% at 19,910.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Such one-off items primarily result from a higher write-down of the investment in the Atlante Funds, on some participations and Deferred Tax Assets for temporary differences and extraordinary contributions to the National Resolution Fund. </p> <p>As a result, the 2016 Group\u2019s estimated net financial result is expected to record a loss of approximately \u20ac11.8bn. </p> </blockquote> <p>Unicredit\u2019s shares fell 5.45% on the news, helping drag the Stoxx 600 Banking Index down 1.68%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0e837e0146e5163cf444ed06cc75ce69810f5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0e837e0146e5163cf444ed06cc75ce69810f5d2/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UniCredit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UniCredit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-588f63efe4b0860ce556a81f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T16:11:41.577Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite the slump in markets following Trump\u2019s travel ban, most are still within reach of record highs.</p> <p>But Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary, has told Bloomberg TV he is concerned about the recent rises in markets:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I think is a clear error, is to confuse several months of strong markets, with strong fundamentals.

They have a huge stake in the United States supporting an open and tolerant global system, they have that stake for their employees, they have it for their customers, they have it for the reputation of the United States and they have spoken out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on chief executives being threatened by the prospect of Trump tweeting against their companies, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure most of them share the values of inclusion, the values of American tradition that were reflected in the statements that John McCain and Lindsey Graham made, the statements that Jeff Immelt made.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if others don\u2019t have those values or whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if they are being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet. But it\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week.

A merger would almost double the size of the current business and would have more than 50% sales to the US. The business would be particularly strong in Energy, Water and Transportation. We believe that speculation is credible given the industry trend towards consolidation and would potentially create a top 5 global design company. Although the history of M&amp;A is chequered in the sector, we see the potential combination as an early cycle play on growth in US infrastructure. CH2M\u2019s third quarter trading update indicated lower earnings year on year. CH2M has had a challenging time but the suggested valuation of $2bn appears to be a reasonable market cap. The enterprise value is significantly higher, given debt, preference shares, pensions, and perhaps joint venture liabilities. The pension will be a key factor although liabilities have reduced post a controversial deal with the PPF. Premature to assess value creation, but expect limited cost-savings and an interesting debate on revenue synergies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Atkins has already said it is hoping to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure spending plans.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:21:48.493Z\">at 2.21pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588f4814e4b0f1550c0da66f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:10:47.838Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/30/stock-markets-us-dollar-trump-travel-ban-german-inflation-business-live?page=with:block-588f391de4b0860ce556a712#block-588f391de4b0860ce556a712\">the German inflation figures</a>, and despite consumer prices increasing by 1.9% year on year in January, that does not mean the ECB should rein in its stimulus programme, says economist Dr Andreas Rees at UniCredit:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Four weeks ago when the December figure was released, there was an outcry by some media and politicians about rising inflation risks in Germany. The ECB should act by unwinding QE as quickly as possible before it is too late, so the story went. It is likely that you will read such statements once again even the latest headline inflation figure came in a tad below expectations. In our view, this kind of thinking is not based on economic facts for two reasons. First, there are no signs of a persistent upward trend in consumer prices. Instead, it is largely about oil. Second, German private households\u2019 inflation expectations remained well anchored.</p> <p>Let us state the obvious: Rising inflation at the turn of the year has primarily been caused by energy prices, or more precisely by the higher oil price. The latest driver was the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia at the end of November to curb output. It was the first agreement of a global oil cartel since 2001. According to our calculations based on federal states data, inflation excluding food and energy was up a more moderate 1.4% year on year after 1.5% in the previous month....</p> <p>More important, the latest inflation excitement in the media and by some policymakers has been crying wolf as flagged by forward-looking surveys. Private households do not anticipate any surging inflation which goes beyond the energy rise. As a matter of fact, inflation expectations of Germans for the next 12 months hit its trough in spring of last year and rose since then, pretty much in line with what one would expect in the light of the oil price increase. The latest inflation expectations survey for January (conducted by the EU Commission) shows that they still remained below its long-term average. In other words, the allegedly so inflation averse Germans have noticed higher fuel price at the gas stations but they are not really concerned for good reason. </p> <p>Going forward, we expect further rising inflation rates in a range of 2\u00bc%-2\u00bd% year on year for the next three months or so before a stabilisation is kicking in. It will be all about the oil price ... whose effects (on a year on year basis) will be fizzling out in the further course of 2017. On average, we expect +1.8% in consumer prices this year after +0.5% in 2016. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:11:19.131Z\">at 2.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588f4623e4b0860ce556a75f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:00:00.414Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump turmoil keeps markets in the red</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s no sign of a recovery in the European stock markets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6993869687bc04daeac7c347e4b4c24679964b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6993869687bc04daeac7c347e4b4c24679964b67/0_0_741_413/500.jpg\" alt=\"European markets, 1.45pm GMT\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>FXTM\u2019s</strong> vice president of market research, <strong>Jameel Ahmad,</strong> says the turmoil caused by the Trump administration in the last few days is to blame<strong>.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the US.</p> <p>What if someone now reacts by banning US products, or even worse US nationals from entering their nations?

                "bodyText":"The uncertainty and chaos caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban has sent stock markets tumbling. With a number of Asian markets falling overnight - the Nikkei lost 0.5% - Europe and the US soon followed suit. In the UK, the FTSE 100 lost all the gains made so far this year, closing at its lowest level since 28 December. Things would have been worse without a boost from Vodafone after the mobile phone group said it was in talks about merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The market narrative has shifted once again. For the past three months a Trump presidency has been heralded as great for stocks. Now, with Dow 20,000 behind us, it seems his government can be blamed for the bout of selling that has engulfed markets. The truth, as ever, probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there is probably some truth in the idea that geopolitical jitters are playing a part in price action today. The FTSE 100 has now surrendered all its gains for the year...Markets overall have been ripe for a correction for some time now, and were merely in need of a reason to begin; Trump\u2019s rambunctious opening to his presidency, and the lighter volumes caused by holidays in Asian markets, may well have provided the bears with the opening they needed. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.92% or 66.01 points at 7118.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.12% to 11,681.89 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.14% at 4784.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.95% to 18,759.40 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.5% lower at 9361.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.53% to 614.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 183 points or 0.92% at 19,910. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Italy\u2019s biggest bank has said its capital ratios at the end of 2016 would not meet requirements set down by the European Central Bank. The bank is launching a \u20ac13bn rights issue to help bolster its finances, which should put it back on track to meet the ECB levels. It said: [We envisage] a temporary deficit versus the corresponding applicable capital requirement as at 31 December 2016 .... by approximately 2% which is expected to be fully restored upon completion of the rights issue, which, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to be settled before March 10th, 2017 on the basis of the current timetable. The bank also said it expected to make an \u20ac11.8bn loss for 2016, with further negative one-off items: Group financial results are impacted by a number of negative non-recurring items of which approximately \u20ac12.2bn were disclosed at UniCredit\u2019s Capital Markets Day, on December 13th, 2016, in the context of the presentation of the 2016-2019 Strategic Plan.. The Group has taken into account a number of additional negative one-off items amounting to approximately \u20ac1.0bn, which are expected to be recorded in 2016. Such one-off items primarily result from a higher write-down of the investment in the Atlante Funds, on some participations and Deferred Tax Assets for temporary differences and extraordinary contributions to the National Resolution Fund. As a result, the 2016 Group\u2019s estimated net financial result is expected to record a loss of approximately \u20ac11.8bn. Unicredit\u2019s shares fell 5.45% on the news, helping drag the Stoxx 600 Banking Index down 1.68%. Despite the slump in markets following Trump\u2019s travel ban, most are still within reach of record highs. But Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary, has told Bloomberg TV he is concerned about the recent rises in markets: What I think is a clear error, is to confuse several months of strong markets, with strong fundamentals. The period post-election when markets did best in the twentieth century was the period between Herbert Hoover\u2019s election and his inauguration. And of course, as a presidency, that was the biggest economic disaster that we had. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next in markets, but nobody should be serene just because markets are behaving well. On the Trump ban he said he was not surprised that the technology sector has spoken out against it: As global businesses, they have a huge stake in the United States being a nation of the Statue of Liberty rather than being a nation of refugee camps and barbed wire. They have a huge stake in the United States supporting an open and tolerant global system, they have that stake for their employees, they have it for their customers, they have it for the reputation of the United States and they have spoken out. And on chief executives being threatened by the prospect of Trump tweeting against their companies, he said: I\u2019m sure most of them share the values of inclusion, the values of American tradition that were reflected in the statements that John McCain and Lindsey Graham made, the statements that Jeff Immelt made. And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if others don\u2019t have those values or whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if they are being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet. But it\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week. That is an extraordinary change in what the United States is about. Back with the markets, and the Dow\u2019s fall back below 20,000, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: In what is a fairly significant development the Dow Jones opened under 20000 this Monday, causing the Trump travel ban losses to increase across the board. The Dow plunged by 150 points after the bell, US investors equally unhappy with the instability brought on by Trump\u2019s actions as their European cousins. Now, the fact that a potentially March rate-hike signalling Fed meeting looms on Wednesday, alongside the first Trump-era non-farm jobs report on Friday, may have something to do with the Dow\u2019s losses. However, there is no doubt that the main catalyst for the drop has been the Muslim travel ban executive order from the President, not for moral reasons that have caused outrage elsewhere but instead the potential ramifications it could have for trade from the Middle East and elsewhere. With the Dow dipping below its landmark 20000 level there was no reason for the European indices to change tack this afternoon. The FTSE maintained a 0.8% decline as the day went on, keeping the UK index at a 2017 low despite the pound\u2019s own slide against the dollar and euro. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, gradually saw their losses intensify after the US open; the German and French indices are now both down 1.1%. Still with housing, but moving to Ireland, and credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s predicts that Irish house prices could rise by 5% this year. Henry McDonald adds: The number of homeowners in the Republic who are trapped in negative equity or have fallen behind in their mortgage repayments has also dropped dramatically, Moody\u2019s say. In their new year analysis of the Irish housing market, which was one of the main factors contributing to Ireland\u2019s economic collapse towards national bankruptcy in the recession, the Moody\u2019s report found that negative equity in the Republic is \u201cstill high.\u201d However, Moody\u2019s have found that the number of borrowers in arrears or negative equity has fallen from its peak in 2013 to one third of all homeowners. In the aftermath of the financial crash, almost two-thirds of Irish homeowners were exposed to mortgage arrears or negative equity. Its report also forecasts a supply shortage in new or available homes which will fuel rising house prices in the state. Overall Moody\u2019s projects that rising house prices and few mortgage arrears will continue to spread to Irish banks and their bonds which are backed up by home loans According to the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation there are 35,000 home owners in the Republic who have been in mortgage arrears for over two years. Signs of strength in the US housing market. Pending home sales rebounded in December after a decline the previous month, with the National Association of Realtors\u2019 index rising by 1.6% to 109. Analysts had been expecting a 1% increase. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: Pending sales rebounded last month as enough buyers fended off rising mortgage rates and alarmingly low inventory levels1 to sign a contract. The main storyline in the early months of 2017 will be if supply can meaningfully increase to keep price growth at a moderate enough level for households to absorb higher borrowing costs. Sales will struggle to build on last year\u2019s strong pace if inventory conditions don\u2019t improve. The news has done little for the market, where investors are more worried about the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. Unsurprisingly given the chaos and uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban and the falls it has caused in Asian and European markets, Wall Street has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 0.66% or 130 points to 19,963 - below the 20,000 barrier it struggled for so long to achieve. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.41% lower and the Nasdaq Composite 0.46%. Losses were not confined to one particular sector but spread across the board. In the UK market, one of the day\u2019s big risers is engineering and consultancy group WS Atkins. Its shares have jumped more than 7% following a report in the Times (\u00a3) that US peer CH2M had approached the group about a possible merger. Atkins - which has partnered the US group on projects - is not commenting, but analysts at Liberum said the idea was credible: A response from Atkins in relation to the rumoured merger with CH2M is possible in the next day. A merger would almost double the size of the current business and would have more than 50% sales to the US. The business would be particularly strong in Energy, Water and Transportation. We believe that speculation is credible given the industry trend towards consolidation and would potentially create a top 5 global design company. Although the history of M&amp;A is chequered in the sector, we see the potential combination as an early cycle play on growth in US infrastructure. CH2M\u2019s third quarter trading update indicated lower earnings year on year. CH2M has had a challenging time but the suggested valuation of $2bn appears to be a reasonable market cap. The enterprise value is significantly higher, given debt, preference shares, pensions, and perhaps joint venture liabilities. The pension will be a key factor although liabilities have reduced post a controversial deal with the PPF. Premature to assess value creation, but expect limited cost-savings and an interesting debate on revenue synergies. Atkins has already said it is hoping to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure spending plans. Back with the German inflation figures, and despite consumer prices increasing by 1.9% year on year in January, that does not mean the ECB should rein in its stimulus programme, says economist Dr Andreas Rees at UniCredit: Four weeks ago when the December figure was released, there was an outcry by some media and politicians about rising inflation risks in Germany. The ECB should act by unwinding QE as quickly as possible before it is too late, so the story went. It is likely that you will read such statements once again even the latest headline inflation figure came in a tad below expectations. In our view, this kind of thinking is not based on economic facts for two reasons. First, there are no signs of a persistent upward trend in consumer prices. Instead, it is largely about oil. Second, German private households\u2019 inflation expectations remained well anchored. Let us state the obvious: Rising inflation at the turn of the year has primarily been caused by energy prices, or more precisely by the higher oil price. The latest driver was the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia at the end of November to curb output. It was the first agreement of a global oil cartel since 2001. According to our calculations based on federal states data, inflation excluding food and energy was up a more moderate 1.4% year on year after 1.5% in the previous month.... More important, the latest inflation excitement in the media and by some policymakers has been crying wolf as flagged by forward-looking surveys. Private households do not anticipate any surging inflation which goes beyond the energy rise. As a matter of fact, inflation expectations of Germans for the next 12 months hit its trough in spring of last year and rose since then, pretty much in line with what one would expect in the light of the oil price increase. The latest inflation expectations survey for January (conducted by the EU Commission) shows that they still remained below its long-term average. In other words, the allegedly so inflation averse Germans have noticed higher fuel price at the gas stations but they are not really concerned for good reason. Going forward, we expect further rising inflation rates in a range of 2\u00bc%-2\u00bd% year on year for the next three months or so before a stabilisation is kicking in. It will be all about the oil price ... whose effects (on a year on year basis) will be fizzling out in the further course of 2017. On average, we expect +1.8% in consumer prices this year after +0.5% in 2016. There\u2019s no sign of a recovery in the European stock markets: FXTM\u2019s vice president of market research, Jameel Ahmad, says the turmoil caused by the Trump administration in the last few days is to blame. Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the US. What if someone now reacts by banning US products, or even worse US nationals from entering their nations? What if investors now decide to take money out of US funds? Over one million Britons have already reacted by signing a petition to stop an upcoming visit from Trump to the United Kingdom, something that will put even more pressure on Theresa May as she has not only just concluded a meeting with the new President but is already under pressure to meet her own deadline to invoke Article 50 within the next two months. Although it is expected and understood that the UK will be aiming to strengthen relationships around the world following the result of the EU Referendum, I am unsure how people will react to Theresa May strengthening a relationship with the United States that appears on track to isolate itself from globalisation. Fresh US consumer spending figures show that the American public kept spending last month. Consumer spending rose by 0.5% in December, up from +0.2% in November, suggesting the economy ended 2016 in solid shape. The report also shows inflation picking up; the Personal Consumption Expenditure index (a measure of the cost of living), jumped to 1.6%, or 1.7% if volatile factors like food and energy are excluded. The jump in German inflation to 1.9% this month will intensify the pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in its stimulus programme. The ECB is currently keeping interest rates at 0%, charging banks which leave money with them, and buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate debt each month with newly created money. With German inflation on the brink of 2%, Berlin will argue that the ECB needs to tighten policy now - even though prices are rising more modestly in other countries. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, says Germany\u2019s \u2018bogeyman\u2019 has returned. But we\u2019re not back in the 1920s yet..... As Brzeski puts it The common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown. First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low... Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Newsflash: Inflation in Germany has hit its highest level since July 2013, in the latest sign that the cost of living is picking up in Europe. Germany\u2019s Consumer Prices Index jumped to 1.9% in January, according to flash estimates, up from 1.7% in December. Some economists had expected it to hit 2% - just over the official target for inflation across the eurozone. There are also signs today that the eurozone debt crisis is bubbling up. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek two-year bonds has jumped from 6.8% to 8.6% today. That means investors are keen to offload the debt, following the IMF\u2019s warning that Greece needs substantial debt relief. Shares in several travel companies have fallen today. Air France-KLM are down 2.2%, IAG (parent company of British Airways) have lost 1.2% and InterContinental Hotels are 1.6% lower. They would all suffer if the global economy slows, or enters an era of greater protectionism. Insurance group AXA UK has pledged to will honour claims from customers affected by Trump\u2019s travel clampdown - even though they\u2019re not technically covered for such disruption. Here\u2019s the official statement: \u201cIn light of the sudden and unexpected decision by the Trump administration to block entry to the US for nationals from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen, AXA Insurance UK confirms that individuals who have been denied entry as a result of the executive order, will be able to claim on their policy. Although not technically covered, we view the current situation as unprecedented and unforeseen and as such we are extending the cover under our policies. For those intending to travel to, or return from, the United States of America we recommend allowing extra time due to protests currently taking place at a number of airports.\u201d European stock markets remain in the red as lunchtime approaches, with the German, French and UK indices all down around 0.8%. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson says the US president\u2019s ban visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen is causing alarm. Global Indices have started on the back foot this morning, after US President Trump announced one of his most radical policies yet, in the form of a travel ban. The resulting press criticism and mass protests appear to have pushed some investors to the sidelines as rising uncertainty in the ability of the President not to cause damage to the US economy starts to increase, and uncertainty rarely bodes well for financial markets. Bloomberg has flagged up that the tech industry has particular reasons to worry about Trump: A glimmer of good news; economic confidence across the euro area has hit its highest level in almost six years. The EC\u2019s Economic Sentiment Indicator, which tracks business and consumer confidence, has jumped to 108.2 from 107.8 in December, the best reading since March 2011. But with Trump causing anxiety worldwide, and crunch elections in Germany and France this year, can confidence hold up? Only a handful of the 100 companies on the blue-chip Footsie index have risen this morning; the rest have been dragged down by concerns over Trump\u2019s policies. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the FTSE 100 is \u2018floundering\u2019 this morning, as it sheds 60 points to its lowest level of 2017. Friday\u2019s dour finish across US markets seems to have paved the way for this morning\u2019s weak trade, with markets turning their focus away from Donald Trump\u2019s business friendly measures and towards his more controversial decision to ban citizens and refugees from seven states in the Middle East and Africa. As we enter February, we are due the typical raft of economic data, with the Bank of England\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 and Friday\u2019s US jobs report meaning that volatility is expected to grow as the week progresses. UK public anger about Trump\u2019s actions continues to build; one million people have now signed the petition opposing him receiving a state visit. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in five hours time. The futures market indicates the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 40-ish points to around 20053, having hit record highs last week. Remo Fritschi, institutional Sales Manager at ADS Securities in London, believes Trump\u2019s refugee clampdown could spur a burst of profit-taking on Wall Street. Wall Street is looking at a softer start to the week as questions begin to mount over just how damaging the new US immigration policy will be to a number of multinational businesses. Sweeping bans on admission to the country from a number of nations risks undermining the globalisation agenda that has helped pump valuations in a range of US-listed stocks over the last few years, whilst the prospect of similar restrictions being applied to US citizens could also hamper overseas trade initiatives. Back in the eurozone, Spain\u2019s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.7% in October-December, matching the growth rate in the previous three months. It means Spain grew by 3.2% in 2016, the third year of growth since its recession during the euro debt crisis. Reminder, we get more eurozone GDP data on Tuesday. Paul Donovan, economist at UBS, has warned clients that investors in the Middle East could pull money out of America, if they feel Trump is persecuting Muslims. European stock markets are all in retreat this morning, as the US travel ban hits sentiment across the continent. The share price rally sparked by Trump\u2019s shock election win in November has now fizzled out; the FTSE 100 is now in the red for 2017. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Pretty much everything slipped into the red this morning, the markets reacting to the fresh bout of instability brought on by Donald Trump over the weekend. Though the Trump rally may have lifted the markets to their current peaks, the global outrage that has greeted the President\u2019s first week in office, the most recent instance being the well-placed disgust at his Muslim travel ban, is now beginning suppress investors\u2019 appetites especially since, as mentioned, the indices are trading so high. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, says Trump is creating \u201cmore uncertainty and jitters among investors.\u201d The major US tech giants have also strongly condemned the president\u2019s executive order which is not helping business confidence. Starbucks, the US coffee giant, announced today that they will hire 10,000 refuges over the next 5 years, sending a clear message to Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant and biased policies. You could certainly say that the tourism sector over in the US might also feel the pinch as holidaying stateside is not an ideal scenario for visitors in light of his new anti-immigration policies. After a blizzard of executive orders on immigration, border control, oil pipelines and trade, it\u2019s becoming clear that Trump actually means what he said during last year\u2019s campaign. This may be an unwelcome shock to investors who hoped the billionaire would take a different path once in office. James Woods, global investment analyst at Rivkin Securities in Sydney, explains (via Reuters): \u201cTrump always stated these were policies he would implement. \u201cQuite a lot of it was brushed off as \u2018campaign rhetoric\u2019 but he is following through. \u201cThis renews concerns about a trade war with China that would significantly affect both Asian and the global economy.\u201d Stock markets and the US dollar are both starting the week on the back foot, as Donald Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban worries investors. Shares have fallen in Asia, amid fears that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt the US economy, and trigger a new phase of protectionism. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.5%, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX index shed almost 1%. European stock markets are under pressure too, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 dropping by 55 points, or 0.75%, to 7129 in early trading. The US dollar also retreated against the Japanese yen, dropping by 0.2% to \u00a5114.88. The selloff comes after Trump imposed a 90-day ban on citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen travelling to the US, and temporarily halted America\u2019s refugee programme. The move has sparked heavy criticism around the globe, and protests in several American cities. In Britain, a petition against Trump being granted a state visit to Britain has already attracted almost one million signatures. Financial analysts are concerned that the backlash against Trump\u2019s plans could have serious economic consequences. Stephen Innes, a senior trader at OANDA, summed the situation up well: \u201cWorld leaders were quick to condemn President Trump\u2019s executive order to ban U.S. travel from seven Muslim countries. The global reaction has been one of universal condemnation. The fear here is that the market may start to think that personal vendetta is clouding the Oval Office judgment and they could express a huge vote of non-confidence through the markets. \u201cThe increase in civil unrest alone should be a concern for investors, and with a lack of clarity on the economic policy front, markets will be cantankerous early in the week as they\u2019re completely uncertain of what\u2019s next from President Trump on the geopolitical landscape.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This is going to be a big week for news, with European growth data being released, two key central bank meetings, and a new healthcheck on America\u2019s jobs market. On Tuesday, we get new eurozone GDP figures showing how the currency bloc fared in the last three months of 2016, plus euro inflation data for January. Wednesday brings a Federal Reserve meeting; the US central bank isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates, but could hint at a hike in March. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: On Thursday the Bank of England will announce its interest rate decision, and publish its quarterly inflation report. With inflation picking up, the BoE could face pressure to raise rates sooner than expected. Finally, Friday will bring the latest US jobs data, in the Non-Farm Payroll report. That will show if America\u2019s labour market is slowing down, after years of solid growth under Barack Obama. Coming up today.... The week starts with new inflation figures from Germany, at 1pm GMT, and America at 1.30pm GMT. Economists predict that Germany\u2019s inflation rate may have risen to 2% in January, slightly over the eurozone\u2019s target, and ahead of other European countries. German politicians are already anxious that the European Central Bank is too relaxed about the rising cost of living, so today\u2019s data could fuel that debate. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: The consensus call is that the German inflation rate rose to 2% y/y in January, in line with the ECB\u2019s own target with the likelihood that the rate will rise further in coming months which will likely see further public calls from Germany policy makers and commentators for the ECB to begin to consider normalising policy. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Greece, as talks with its creditors drag on. Experts fear trouble ahead unless the latest phase of Athens\u2019 bailout is signed off by 20 February. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The fallout of Trump\u2019s ban on travel, his firing of the acting attorney general, followed by the attack on the euro and Germany by his top trade advisor, have all added to the mood of growing uncertainty. Some unimpressive updates have not helped.

But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. <br></p> <p>Speaking on Skai TV this morning, <strong>Nikos Xydakis</strong>, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, <strong>Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou</strong> similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. </p> <p>In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner <strong>Anna Diamantopoulou</strong> demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5890a055e4b0e481c6e49340\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T14:45:18.089Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b0e8abd8cc2dadf6c5f896ba4e0e1607a8f8a665\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e8abd8cc2dadf6c5f896ba4e0e1607a8f8a665/0_0_2748_3802/723.jpg\" alt=\"The Wall Street sign and the front of the New York Stock Exchange in New York.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders.</p> <p><strong>FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States.</p> <p>While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58909bd1e4b0f1550c0dadaf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T14:22:51.370Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6091f3cd41e80f374a3d4863f91429f86a3b468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6091f3cd41e80f374a3d4863f91429f86a3b468/0_0_5072_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sweden\u2019s Prime minister Stefan Lofven giving a press conference in Stockholm today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sweden\u2019s Prime minister Stefan Lofven giving a press conference in Stockholm today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/31/eurozone-gdp-french-economy-grows-unemployment-germany-mario-draghi-live?page=with:block-58907897e4b0b3e971af5115#block-58907897e4b0b3e971af5115\"> Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism:</a></strong></p> <p>Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed.</p> <p> \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The new US administration has opened up a new front against Europe, accusing Germany of unfairly profiting from the \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro. Peter Navarro, who heads up Donald Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, made the comments in an FT interview today. The comments sent the euro spiking; it\u2019s now at its highest level since November. But German chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to rebuff the comments, saying that Germany can\u2019t control the value of the euro anyway. New data has shown that Europe\u2019s economy continues to recover -- and that price pressures are building. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, new data shows, meaning that it grew faster last year than America. Inflation is also on the rise; the consumer prices index jumped by 1.8% year-on-year. But the increase was mainly due to energy prices, with core inflation remaining at 0.9%. There was also relief that the eurozone jobless rate fell again, to 9.6% in December. But the divisions in Europe were clear to see - with Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hitting a post-reunification low, while Italy\u2019s remains at the highest since July 2015. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Greece\u2019s deadlocked talks with creditors have once more raised the spectre of Grexit. And back across the Atlantic, US consumer confidence dropped in January from the fifteen year high seen in December. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite a busy day for economic and corporate news, the actions of the Trump administration were once again at the forefront of investors minds. The fallout of Trump\u2019s ban on travel, his firing of the acting attorney general, followed by the attack on the euro and Germany by his top trade advisor, have all added to the mood of growing uncertainty. Some unimpressive updates have not helped. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said A double whammy in the form of misses for the Chicago PMI and consumer confidence on the economic front, plus a poor set of numbers from economic bellwether UPS, have resulted in a continuation of yesterday\u2019s risk-off atmosphere. Only in London is the mood more optimistic, where once again it is the FTSE\u2019s mining contingent that is helping to [support] the index. In the end the FTSE also succumbed to the negative mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.27% or 19.33 points at 7099.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.25% to 11,535.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% lower at 4748.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.9% to 18,590.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.49% lower at 9315.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.38% to 611.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 138 points or 0.7%. It\u2019s probably no surprise that market volatility is on the rise after the first few days of the Trump presidency. And after a dip on Monday it is back up again: Despite the drop in US consumer confidence, it is still at fairly high levels. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Although slightly down on last month\u2019s historic high US consumer confidence remains strong in the face of uncertainty. The US economy is enjoying robust numbers at the moment and Fed Chair Janet Yellen will likely be inching closer to the first of three possible interest rate rises this year. American citizens appear to be confident in the potential growth of business conditions, stock prices and jobs. However, the world\u2019s largest economy is now being steered by an unpredictable new leader in the form of Donald Trump and the year ahead could still be bumpy. That didn\u2019t last long... US consumer confidence has dropped, having spiked in the aftermath of the US election victory. America\u2019s Conference Board reports that its consumer confidence index dipped to 111.8 this month, down from the fifteen-year high struck in December. Over to Greece where deadlocked talks with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat have once again raised the spectre of Grexit and the need for contingency plans. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: It is a scenario that in the ranks of Syriza, the governing left-wing party, no one openly wants. But as the extent of the impasse between Greece and its creditors becomes ever clear \u2013 with lenders insisting that without further cuts further bailout loans cannot be made \u2013 prominent Syriza figures have begun to talk publicly of the need to address Grexit as a possibility. Speaking on Skai TV this morning, Nikos Xydakis, former alternate foreign minister for European affairs, said discussion of euro exit should not longer be considered \u201ctaboo.\u201d \u201cThere should be no taboos when we\u2019re talking about the nation\u2019s fate. We have come to a point where the populace has run out of stamina. I believe we need an in-depth political and national discussion that has not taken place in seven years and, of course, this discussion needs to start in parliament.\u201d Given that Germany\u2019s finance minister had repeatedly raised the issue of Greece returning to the drachma it was, he added, impossible to avoid the subject. \u201cWhat can you say? I\u2019m not going to discuss it when Mr Schauble is saying it,\u201d he asked. Expounding on his belief that the euro zone will some day dissolve, Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou similarly said Athens should be working on contingency plans for a scenario that should not be discounted. \u201cWe have to be prepared for every eventuality \u2026 the government should be working on a plan,\u201d he told the radio station, Action FM, insisting that if euro exit were to happen Greece should not do it alone but on the coattails of another euro zone member also exiting. \u201cItaly may leave. If that happens Greece should hide behind it and leave at the time.\u201d In the wake of virulent response to his comments Xydakis later tried to clarify on his FaceBook page that he was not in favour of Grexit. But his remarks appeared to have opened the door to something far bigger than he may have intended. In a letter to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou demanded to know what plans had been drawn up around Grexit at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in 2015. \u201cXydakis\u2019 statements - expected although we did not know who would utter them or when - have formally brought the views and thoughts of members of today\u2019s Syriza-Anel coalition government to public discussion. The dilemma, drachma or euro, will sow division with civil war passion in a country which should urgently unite and stand on its feet.\u201d Over in New York, Wall Street has opened lower as investors continue to watch political developments closely, and nervously. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 72 points, or 0.35%, in early trading to 19,901. Trump\u2019s decision to fire his acting attorney general overnight, following the travel ban that sparked protests in America and beyond, is clearly worrying some traders. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad says that: Although some of the selling momentum experienced yesterday throughout the stock markets has cooled down, the market headlines across the globe continue to be dominated by the executive order from Donald Trump to ban certain nationals from entering the United States. While it has to be taken into account that the record moves seen in the stock markets last week would increase the risks of some investors being tempted to take profits from positions, there is no doubting that this move from Trump has caused outrage across the globe and such actions represent a risk to the market sentiment. Reuters have helpfully published Angela Merkel\u2019s response to Peter Navarro\u2019s criticism: Speaking in Stockholm, on a visit to Sweden, the German chancellor said: \u201cGermany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed. \u201cBecause of that we will not influence the behaviour of the ECB. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is.\u201d City experts aren\u2019t convinced by Peter Navarro\u2019s comments about the euro: Here\u2019s former UBS chief economist George Magnus: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets: Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye Risk Management, is even less impressed: Newsflash: German chancellor Angela Merkel has responded to Peter Navarro\u2019s attack. She says that Germany cannot influence the value of the euro, and that the country has always pushed for the European Central Bank to be independent. Does Peter Navarro have a point, when he claims Germany is exploiting other countries through its cheap currency? Well.... Germany posted a record trade surplus in 2015, and will probably do the same when 2016\u2019s numbers are added up. Cheap currencies boost exports, and no-one would argue that the euro would be more valuable if you removed the weaker members from the currency bloc. Back in 2015, former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke blogged that the German trade surplus was \u201ca problem\u201d for the global economy. He argued that Berlin should boost government spending, and workers\u2019 wages, to help drive it down. However.... Bernanke also pointed out that Germany has little control over the value of the euro. It has fallen near to parity with the US dollar because the European Central Bank has slashed interest rates to record lows (unpopular in Germany), imposed negative rates on banks (unpopular in Germany) and created tens of billions of euros to buy government bonds (unpopular in Germany). Currency wars aren\u2019t a new issue either. NBC correspondent Hans Nichols points out that the Obama administration had its own concerns about the euro, when it was stronger: The prospect of a currency spat between the US and the eurozone has pushed the euro up against all major currencies. The single currency is up 0.7% against the dollar now, to $1.0764, after Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed it was \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d. This means the US dollar is still on track to post its worst January since 2008 (as recorded earlier). The euro has also gained 0.6% against the pound to 86.1p, meaning one pound is worth \u20ac1.1608. Peter Navarro\u2019s attack on Germany over the euro shows that the Trump administration are concerned about countries who run a trade surplus with the US. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Citigroup global econonomics director Ebrahim Rahbari says that \u201ctalking about a currency is much easier than taking specific measures\u201d. Currency rates have clearly been under discussion for some time, at forums such as the G20, Rahbari points out. So Navarro is \u201cratcheting up the discussions that have previously taken place\u201d, he concludes. Hold onto your hats, folks. The Financial Times is reporting that one of Donald Trump\u2019s advisers has hit out at Germany, saying it gets an unfair advantage due to the weakness of the euro. Here\u2019s the story, by the FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan: Germany is using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to exploit the US and its EU partners, Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser has said in comments that are likely to trigger alarm in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Peter Navarro, the head of Mr Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, told the Financial Times the euro was like an \u201cimplicit Deutsche Mark\u201d whose low valuation gave Germany an advantage over its main partners. His views suggest the new administration is focusing on currency as part of its hard-charging approach on trade ties. In a departure from past US policy, Mr Navarro also called Germany one of the main hurdles to a US trade deal with the EU and declared talks with the bloc over a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership dead. Here\u2019s the full story: Trump\u2019s top trade adviser accuses Germany of currency exploitation The euro is now rising sharply against the US dollar, as traders anticipate action from Washington over this issue. It\u2019s gained almost 0.5% to \u20ac1.074. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the news that eurozone growth and inflation have risen, while the unemployment rate has hit a new seven-year low. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: In the Eurozone GDP figures have been released this morning. Inflation in Spain has increased to 3% as has the cost of living in France, up by 1.4%; while the broader EU CPI measure jumped to 1.8% largely driven by a jump in energy prices. The French economy grew 1.1% in 2016 slightly less than expected but despite this Michel Sapin, the French minister of finance, insisted the French economy is still moving in the right direction and reducing unemployment. Overall, Eurozone GDP came in at 0.5% for the last quarter which was better than forecast and unemployment fell. All this positive data suggests the Eurozone is recovering slowly, though Italy continues to remain a weak point. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity: Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, A fresh and intricate new conundrum has reared its ugly head for Mario Draghi this morning as the pressure of a significant uplift in German inflation has pushed the Eurozone figure up to 1.8% for January. The renown \u2018powerhouse\u2019 of the Eurozone is now putting significant pressure on the ECB President as euro-sceptics are quickly pointing out that stimulus measures are falling far short of creating a balanced and improved bloc state. Whilst GDP saw an uplift this morning, as well as a diminishing Unemployment rate also posted, inflation has, and will be for the foreseeable future, the focus. With such wild swings upwards, Draghi will have to adopt Monetary policy accordingly, which at present isn\u2019t hugely clear as to what path he should, or is willing to take. Many analysts suggest Quantitative Easing is falling far short of improving the economic situation, and Draghi always notes \u2018other tools\u2019 which he can, and will adopt - perhaps now is the time for him to lay his cards on the table, so to speak. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: The ECB has been wont to point out that core inflation remains a problem and the uptick in prices might not last. And again this remains stubbornly below the headline figure at just 0.9%. No cause for the ECB to tighten monetary policy just yet but refreshingly upbeat figures nonetheless. The data is improving in Europe but there is as yet no sign of anything other than monetary policy divergence between the Fed and European Central Bank. Greece\u2019s debt problems won\u2019t go away and political risks are abundant. The eurozone didn\u2019t manage to match Britain\u2019s economy, though. UK GDP grew by 0.6% in the last three months of 2016, and by 2.2% during the year. The eurozone outperformed the United States last year. Today\u2019s growth figures show that the eurozone expanded by 1.8% in 2016; last Friday, we learned that America only grew by 1.6%. This is the first time the Eurozone has grown faster than the US in a calendar year since 2008, when the financial crisis struck. Eurozone politicians will be delighted to see the region\u2019s jobless rate fall to 9.6% (not 9.8% as I mistyped earlier, sorry). This is the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. The jobless rate across the European Union came in at 8.2%, unchanged from November, and the lowest since February 2009. The lowest rates were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany, while Greece suffered the worst jobless rate (23.0% in October 2016) followed by Spain (18.4%). There are still 20.065 million men and women out of work in the EU, including 15.571 million in the euro area. And young people are still finding it hard to find work; in December 2016, the youth unemployment rate was 18.6% in the EU28 and 20.9% in the euro area, compared with 19.5% and 21.8% respectively in December 2015. Important point: eurozone core inflation (which strips out food and energy) was only 0.9% this month, rather than the headline figure of 1.8%. That\u2019s little comfort to households facing a cash squeeze, but it does give the European Central Bank a good reason not to be bounced into changing monetary policy. Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, explains: \u201cHeadline inflation is clearly picking up in the Eurozone, but a lot of that is linked to energy price base effects (+8.1% compared with +2.6% in December). As highlighted in their most recent press conference, the ECB itself is willing to look through these transient gains. As such, we believe that it is too early to call for any sort of further \u201ctapering\u201d in the region, especially ahead of a very busy political agenda. Growth up, inflation up, unemployment down.... On an annual basis, the eurozone grew by 1.8% last year - up from 1.5% in 2015. My Reuters machine is gasping for air as a burst of newsflashes ripple out from the eurozone, giving new insights into the European economy. New growth figures show that the euro area grew by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, suggesting the region\u2019s recovery is picking up pace. But inflation has jumped by more than expected, to 1.8% in January. That\u2019s the highest in almost four-years, driven by a steep rise in energy prices. The European Central Bank\u2019s target is to keep inflation just below 2% - these figures are surely going to fuel calls for the ECB to stop its bond-buying stimulus programme, and consider pushing interest rates up. And the unemployment rate across the region has dropped to 9.6% in December  , a new seven-year low. Details and reaction to follow.... The latest unemployment news from Italy is rather disappointing. The Italian jobless rate came in at 12% in December, higher than expected, while November\u2019s reading has been revised up from 11.9% to 12%. These are the highest readings since July 2015. The US dollar is poised to suffer its worst start to any year since 2008. The greenback has fallen by 1.9% against a basket of currencies this month, partly thanks to yesterday\u2019s selloff as Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive orders alarmed traders. The pound, for example, has gained over 1.5 cents against the US dollar this month, from $1.233 to $1.25. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says it\u2019s very hard to know how the markets will react to Trump. President Trump\u2019s travel ban - and his associated decision to fire the acting Attorney General - dominates sentiment and remains good for Treasuries, the yen (and gold), but bad for bonds and the dollar. How long will market sentiment to be affected? How far can the dollar and yields fall on this? I\u2019m not sure serious analysis is possible, and I don\u2019t trust my gut instincts on something as far from the usual state of affairs, but my bias is still that we\u2019ll get back to the Trump economic program, and the implications for Fed policy, before too long. More prosaically, markets will focus on the US jobs data due Friday. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s jobs market remains as strong as ever. The unemployment total in Europe\u2019s largest economy has fallen again this month, by 26,000 people, to 2.605m. That takes Germany\u2019s jobless rate down to 5.9%. UK online supermarket group Ocado is the best performing stock across Europe, jumping by 6.5%. It posted a 21% jump in pre-tax profits this morning, to \u00a314.5m, and told shareholders it was busier than ever, in its long-running attempt to sign an overseas deal. The only problem is that we\u2019ve been waiting YEARS for Ocado to team up with an international partner. The company insists there are plenty of suiters in the wings, but there\u2019s still no actual agreement. Retail analyst Nick Bubb predicts: Management will have to put up with more questions from the City today about the failure to deliver an Overseas deal in the analysts meeting at 9.30am\u2026 European stock markets have opened nervously, following those losses in Asia overnight. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has inched up by 0.2%, while the French CAC and German DAX are both flat. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says investors are juggling political and economic concerns right now. It\u2019s been an interesting start to the week, with protests against President Trump\u2019s immigration ban dominating market news and reaction. Trump\u2019s use of executive power has not stopped with immigration; on Monday he signed a new order that will cap business regulation. While politics took centre stage at the start of the week, earnings from Apple and Exxon on later today, along with a flurry of central bank meetings this week will be critical for determining what matters more to markets right now: politics or economics. Back to GDP....and Austria has posted another quarter of solid growth. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, matching the (upwardly revised) growth in July-September. Austria\u2019s statistics body said that consumer spending and investment were the main factors behind the growth, as in France. Newsflash: Inflation in Spain has surged this month, to 3% on an EU-harmonised basis. The cost of living in France has accelerated too, jumping from 0.8% to 1.6% . The rises are mainly due to higher energy prices, and it suggests the eurozone inflation rate, due in two hour\u2019s time, has also risen sharply this month. If so, there\u2019ll be a lot more pressure on the European Central Bank to consider tightening its stimulus programme, especially from Germany (where inflation jumped to 1.9%, according to figures released on Monday). Asian stock markets have had another poor day, as fears about Donald Trump\u2019s actions continue to rile investors. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 1.7%, its biggest drop since October, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.7%. On Monday, global markets suffered their biggest one-day drop in six weeks, amid global condemnation of the US president\u2019s travel ban on seven countries in the Middle East. The news that Trump had fired attorney general Sally Yates after she instructed lawyers not to defend the ban has added to the nervous mood, and fears that Trump is destabilising the world order. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says (via Reuters): Investors are becoming worried as it appears as if he was setting fire to geopolitical risks that already exist. We don\u2019t have any growth figures from Germany today. Instead, we\u2019ve got a nasty fall in retail spending. German retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in December, dashing hopes of a recovery after a 1.7% drop in November. These figures are often volatile, but it could suggest consumers in Europe\u2019s largest economy were cautious in the run-up to Christmas. Outgoing French president Francois Hollande will surely be pleased that the economy is growing, but his successor still faces a big challenge: German journalist Gesche W\u00fcpper points out that France\u2019s growth during 2016 was weaker than hoped, at just 1.1% for the year. Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi tweets this graph, showing how France\u2019s growth has been volatile and unspectacular over the last few years: Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group, shows how France (in green) has lagged behind Sweden, the US, Germany and the UK over the last decade. France has got Eurozone GDP Day off to a good start, by reporting that its economy accelerated in the last three months of 2016. French GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December quarter, twice as fast as in July-September. This suggests that France\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis continues, despite the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote last summer. The figures also show that France\u2019s economy grew by 1.1% during 2016. Statistics body INSEE says that consumer and business spending drove the recovery. \u201cHousehold consumption expenditures\u201d rose by 0.6% during the month. while \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d jumped by 0.8%. Exports were \u201cmore dynamic\u201d, rising by +1.1% during the quarter while imports grew by 0.8%. And that means foreign trade balance contributed slightly to GDP growth: +0.1 points after \u22120.7 points in the previous quarter. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be looking at Europe\u2019s economy this morning, as new data are released showing how the eurozone is performing. The first estimate of eurozone GDP for the last quarter of 2016, due at 10am GMT, may show that growth picked up to +0.4%, from +0.3%. We\u2019ll also get some figures from individual countries, including France. The latest eurozone unemployment figures are also due at 10am GMT; economists reckon the jobless rate will stick at 9.8% again, the lowest since 2009. But Italy\u2019s figures, due at 9am GMT, will surely show that its recovery is lagging behind. Plus, the latest estimate of eurozone inflation is released (yup, also at 10am GMT). We also get German retail sales figures for December at 7am; they\u2019re expected to bounce back by around 0.6% after shrinking by 1.8% in November. And at 8am, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving speech on \u201cInto the future: Europe\u2019s digital integrated market\u201d in Frankfurt, Germany. Europe\u2019s financial markets are expected to be subdued, following yesterday\u2019s losses as investors watched the backlash against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day...",
