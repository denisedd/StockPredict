Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u2019s privatisation in 1984.</p> <p>And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u2019s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere.</p> <p>Some \u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013.</p> <p>That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red.</p> <p>So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BT\u2019s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u2019t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings.</p> <p>So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news?</p> <p>First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return.</p> <p>It\u2019s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3666cbfd73f92985ec2bf9d36a6bbcf5f937183f/0_45_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Italy\u2019s headquarters in Milan,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Italy\u2019s headquarters in Milan,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u2019s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further.</p> <p>Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u2019s pension black hole, which it has to review this year.</p> <p>Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58877a62e4b0d7c340749709\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T17:10:14.617Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets end higher but FTSE 100 hit by BT fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results.</p> <p>Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher.</p> <p>News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u2018buy the rumour, sell the fact\u2019 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say.</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\">an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy</a> certainly fitted the bill.

But overall sales for 2016 rose to 5.45m, the highest since 2006, from 5.25m the previous year. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said the housing market\u2019s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December.</p> <p>While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58876bcbe4b0d7c3407496b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-24T15:04:29.033Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Better than forecast US manufacturing data adds to rate rise expectations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years.</p> <p>The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u2019s final figure of 54.3.

Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u2019s suggestion of a \u00a3145m charge didn\u2019t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u2019s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years.</p> <p>Even management isn\u2019t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield.

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s been a day to forget for BT, its executives and of course its army of small shareholders. Around 700,000 people own less than 1,600 shares, a legacy of the telecoms group\u2019s privatisation in 1984. And they as much as anyone will be shocked by the 20% plunge in the company\u2019s shares after it revealed a worse than expected hit to its figures from an accounting scandal in Italy, not to mention a warning of a slowdown in business elsewhere. Some \u00a38bn was wiped off the value of BT as its shares fell from 382.55p to 303p, its lowest level since June 2013. That in turn knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, which would otherwise have been firmly in positive territory rather than slipping slightly into the red. So where now for BT shares? Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: BT\u2019s 20% drop today fairly rattled the City. It was one of the biggest ever single-day falls for a company of this sort. Blue chips like BT just don\u2019t make those kinds of losses on one announcement about a part of the business that accounts for just 1% of earnings. So is this a golden buying opportunity for investors, or does BT merit a fundamental recalibration of its stock price based on the news? First, the upside. BT is now looking very cheap on a price to forward earnings ratio (about 10 times). That appears like mightily good value for a company that pays juicy dividends and says it will continue to increase these by 10% a year over the next two years. That could mean a roughly 4% yield for buyers entering now, which if it can manage to deliver is a pretty attractive return. It\u2019s also dodged a bullet or two by retaining control of Openreach, the jewel in the crown, despite pressure from Ofcom. The acquisition of EE enables to become a genuine quad-play provider. Sports broadcasting is also improving revenues but at a fairly hefty cost. The downside, however, looks ominous. The Italian fiasco will gobble up a whopping \u00a3500m in free cash in 2016/2017 and a further \u00a3500m in 2017/18. Although BT has largely completed its investigation, there is a risk that this could blow up further and it\u2019s wise to be cautious. The Financial Reporting Council could take this further. Operating costs seem to be rising, as are debts. Acquisition of EE, while a strategic long-term play, has meant net debts have risen to nearly \u00a310bn. That is also the figure for BT\u2019s pension black hole, which it has to review this year. Another red flag is the outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets, which BT says has deteriorated, meaning it expects a double-digit year-on-year percentage decline in fourth quarter underlying EBITDA adjusted for the acquisition of EE. That is a big concern and signals that investment is drying up. All this points to growing pressure on free cash, which BT needs to keep growing the dividends. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. There is a degree of caution around the markets, as investors await more decisions from US president Donald Trump after his protectionist rhetoric so far. And with the US reporting season underway, they are also looking to see whether companies can justify their hefty valuations with their results. Overall, with Wall Street higher by the time Europe closed - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 61 points or 0.3% - continental markets ended the day higher. News that the UK parliament had won the right to a vote on Brexit did little to support the pound, which is currently unchanged at $1.2530 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2419. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The [UK supreme] court ruling sent the British pound lower, though it finished well off its lows. There was an element of \u2018buy the rumour, sell the fact\u2019 in currency markets to the well-telegraphed decision. In all likelihood Article 50 will still be triggered in March irrespective of the supreme court. In many ways this is just one less roadblock out of the way before the UK leaves the EU. If anything, the net effect leans towards a harder Brexit in that Scotland and the devolved assemblies, which mostly voted to Remain in the EU, will have less say. So with the pound failing to gain ground, the FTSE 100 was open to reacting to any shocks, and an unexpected profit warning from BT after worse than expected accounting irregularities in Italy certainly fitted the bill. BT\u2019s decline knocked 26 points off the leading index, which otherwise would have been well in positive territory. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 0.84 points or 0.01% to 7150.34 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.43% to 11,594.94 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.18% at 4830.03 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.89% at 19,499.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.89% at 9387.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.13% to 646.51 Back with BT, and Reuters is reporting that Italian prosecutors are opening their own investigation into alleged false accounting and embezzlement at BT Italia. Meanwhile a number of US law firms which specialise in shareholder class action cases say they are looking at whether BT violated federal securities laws. But existing home sales in the US fell by more than expected in December, as the supply of houses on the market dropped to levels not seen since 1999. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49m units, compared to forecasts of a 1.1% decline to 5.52m. But overall sales for 2016 rose to 5.45m, the highest since 2006, from 5.25m the previous year. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said the housing market\u2019s best year since the Great Recession ended on a healthy but somewhat softer note: Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market. However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December. While a lack of listings and fast rising home prices was a headwind all year, the surge in rates since early November ultimately caught some prospective buyers off guard and dimmed their appetite or ability to buy a home as 2016 came to an end. US manufacturing has got off to a good start in 2017, with overall conditions improving at the quickest pace for two years. The initial Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for January came in at 55.1, compared to expectations of a figure of 54.5 and a rise from December\u2019s final figure of 54.3. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: US manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders. New work is growing at the fastest rate for over two years, thanks mainly to rising demand from customers in the home market. Export growth remains subdued, stymied by the strong dollar. The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months. Rising factory employment should also help improve consumer morale and spending. However, with such strong growth being signalled and price pressures rising, speculation around the next Fed rate hike will intensify. With US investors awaiting more details of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans, the main impetus for the market has been his protectionist stance on trade, including pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So Wall Street is currently searching for direction, as the US reporting season gathers pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 13 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened marginally higher. Shares in broadcaster ITV have jumped by over 5% today, on speculation that a bid battle could be coming. The rally sparked by the Evening Standard\u2019s Jamie Nimmo, who reported that several US companies are interested.... He writes: Chatter in the Square Mile that Liberty Global could buy out ITV is nothing new, but rumour has it that the Virgin Media owner may face competition from some of the world\u2019s largest companies. The word on the street is that major shareholders of ITV have been sounded out by tech giants Apple, Amazon and Netflix about a possible takeover. They are thought to have been enticed by the cheap pound and ITV\u2019s production arm \u2014 behind shows such as Mr Selfridge and which has been growing over the past few years through acquisitions. The gossip suggests the US giants are willing to pay 300p a share, valuing ITV at around \u00a312 billion. More here: ITV\u2019s shares are currently changing hands at around 210p - a long way from 300p, suggesting the City isn\u2019t convinced a bid is coming. One to watch though.... Software giant Microsoft has just released a statement, insisting that it remains committed to the UK following reports that Brexit might disrupt its operations. The company says: The comments reported today by a Microsoft employee were not reflective of the company\u2019s view. As we have said both before and after the EU referendum vote, Microsoft\u2019s commitment to the UK is unchanged. In particular, those customers in our UK data centres should continue to rely on Microsoft\u2019s significant investment plans there. Which employee, I hear you cry... ...well, it\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s UK government affairs manager Owen Larter. Yesterday, he told a webinar that importing hardware to the UK could become too pricey, if tariffs were imposed after Britain leave the EU. Larter said: \u201cIf all of a sudden there are huge import [tariffs] on server racks from China or from eastern Europe, where a lot of them are actually assembled, that might change our investment decisions and perhaps we build out our datacenters across other European countries.\u201d TechRepublic has the full story. The pound is falling further as the UK government pushes on with its Brexit plans following today\u2019s supreme court ruling. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.246. having hit $1.253 earlier in the day. It fell as Brexit secretary David Davis told MPs that a bill seeking permission to trigger Article 50 will be introduced within days. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says \u2018hard Brexit fears\u2019 have been fuelled by the judges\u2019 ruling that the devolved administrations needn\u2019t give their approval for Article 50 to be triggered. Although today\u2019s ruling has provided some clarity in the short term on the steps needed for Brexit to happen; the pending Brexit fuelled debates with the Parliament and potential complications could create a new layer of uncertainty consequently weakening the Pound. Breaking: UK bank HSBC has announced plans to shut 62 branches across the UK. The move will cost 180 jobs, and is part of the bank\u2019s cost-cutting programme. With more customers using electronic banking services, HSBC argues that it needs fewer physical branches. The BBC\u2019s Simon Gompertz has got hold of a list; it includes branches in Blackpool, Chipping Norton, Newquay and Warwick. Today\u2019s tumble makes BT\u2019s shares rather more attractive to investors on a price/earnings basis. The company still expects to grow its dividend by 10% per share this financial year, and in 2017-18. But the Italian accountancy scandal, and the warning that BT\u2019s UK\u2019s public sector business is slowing, are reasons to be cautious. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: At ten times forward earnings, the shares are now the cheapest they have been since early 2013, but the fundamental case for investing, aside from the dividend, has still to be proved. Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher\u2019s news story on BT\u2019s Italian problems: The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack is reporting that the head of BT\u2019s Continental Europe division, Corrado Sciolla, will resign today. Sciolla is a former boss of BT Italy, who was promoted to become president of Continental Europe four years ago. Here\u2019s his biography, from BT\u2019s website: Corrado is responsible for making sure we grow quickly and profitably across Europe - where we serve big brands like Fiat, ENI, Syngenta and The European Parliament. Corrado\u2019s career started as a McKinsey consultant, then he had various directorships at Stream (an Italian pay-TV firm), Syntek Capital, and Wind Telecomunicazioni (Italy\u2019s second-biggest fixed and mobile telecoms operator). In 2004, he became managing director of Albacom, a joint venture between BNL and BT. When BT bought Albacom outright in 2006, he became CEO of BT Italy and \u2013 in 2011 \u2013 president of BT France as well. Corrado is Italian. He has an electronic engineering degree from the Polytechnic University of Turin and an MBA from the INSEAD business school. There\u2019s no respite for BT\u2019s share price this morning; it\u2019s still down almost 18% at 314p, which knocks over \u00a36bn off its value. The accounting scandal in Italy (details), and the news that BT\u2019s UK business is slowing too, are alarming the City. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there were already concerns about BT\u2019s debt and its pension black hole: \u201cThe revelation that accounting deficiencies in Italy are worse than previously thought is a bitter, and needless to say unwelcome, pill to swallow for BT investors. With news that its Business and Public Sector division is coming under pressure too, worries about the group\u2019s ability to fund its generous dividend policy will surely grow. Full year profits are now expected to be around \u00a3300m lower than had been hoped, with around \u00a3500m of 2016/17 free cash flow disappearing. Just about the only guidance that was left unchanged is the dividend, where the group is still targeting at least 10% increases this year and next. With the group\u2019s net debts pushing \u00a39.6bn following the acquisition of EE, and a review of the how to fund the \u00a39.5bn pension deficit coming up in June, there were already a few jitters around the stock so this was the last thing the group needed.\u201d On the surface, the latest figures on the UK\u2019s public finances were worse than expected, with a marginally bigger deficit than predicted in December. But the release should still provide some cheer to chancellor Philip Hammond with revisions to November\u2019s figures meaning he now looks more likely to hit his borrowing target for the full year. Public sector net borrowing decreased by \u00a30.4bn to \u00a36.9bn in December 2016, compared with December 2015, the Office for National Statistics said. The consensus forecast was for a bigger drop to 6.7bn in a Reuters poll of economists. In the current financial year-to-date (April to December 2016), the public sector borrowed \u00a363.8bn. That was \u00a310.6bn lower than in the previous financial year-to-date, helped by a smaller deficit than previously thought for November. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is forecasting full-year (April 2016-March 2017) public sector net borrowing of \u00a368.2bn. Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in borrowing in December continued the recent trend of a gradual improvement in the public finances. Explaining the pattern, he said: The improvement was mainly driven by a 5.6% annual rise in central government receipts, while spending actually fell slightly on a year earlier. And looking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been on a slight upward trend since May \u2013 adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU... We think borrowing should come in slightly below the OBR\u2019s current \u00a368bn forecast for the 2016/17 fiscal year.\u201d Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), sounds a cautious note about the future state of the public finances as the Brexit process unfolds. The UK\u2019s fiscal position, which was weakened significantly by the financial crisis, is likely to come under increasing pressure in the near-term if UK economic growth weakens as expected. A slowing economy would further restrict the UK\u2019s capacity to collect enough tax revenue to consistently achieve deficit reduction in the coming years. More needs to be done to boost business confidence, to help firms to deliver the sort of growth, investment and job creation needed to achieve a sustainable strengthening of the UK\u2019s tax base.\u201d As predicted in our agenda, the pound has flailed around as Britain\u2019s top judges delivered their verdict on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The supreme court ruled by 8 votes to 3 that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval. That sent the pound up to $1.2535, suggesting traders reckon this could slow the Brexit process. But the pound then fell back as the judges announced that the devolved assemblies in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not need to give their own assent. That removes one possible hurdle to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Andy Sparrow\u2019s politics liveblog has full details and rolling reaction. In other news, Europe\u2019s factories and service sector firms have made a solid start to 2017. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly eurozone PMI has come in at 54.3, down slightly from 54.4. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Firms added new jobs at the fastest rate in 9 years too, while factory growth hit a five-year high. Encouraging stuff. BT\u2019s shares are popular with small shareholders, some of whom will have held them since the company was privatised in 1984. So today\u2019s share plunge will have hit them in the pocket (although BT says it hopes to keep raising its dividend over the next couple of years) The Share Centre, a retail stockbroker, have put their \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation on review. Helal Miah, investment research analyst, says: \u201cOn top of BT\u2019s big pension deficit and grumbles amongst rivals and users of its infrastructure network, today\u2019s news has further dented investors\u2019 confidence in the group. We too, have become more cautious and have placed our current \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation under review. However, this may be an attractive idea for investors taking a contrarian position and, provided the group maintains its dividend, then it could become a good income option.\u201d Here\u2019s Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets on BT shock warning: This morning sees BT Group (BT/A) shares -16% to trade levels last seen in mid-2013. Just as brokers and investors were prepping for FY results on Friday, the company delivers a profits warning linked to an existing accounting scandal at its Italian business. Continued investigation since October (internal + external) has shown the extent of impropriety (sales, purchase, leasing) and overstatement of profits to be far greater than initially thought. Management has been forced to more than triple its expected write-down to \u00a3530m and admit that FY revenues, profits and cash flow will be lower than consensus. Last October\u2019s suggestion of a \u00a3145m charge didn\u2019t cause too many ripples as regulatory issues and a rising pension deficit hogged the headlines. Today\u2019s admission adds this to these nasty headwinds, especially as it could weigh on profits for the next two years. Even management isn\u2019t sure what the final figure will be. The group still expects 10% dividend increases for the next two years but is this enough to appease disgruntled shareholders who had already been wearing a 20% downtrend since early 2016. The increases may, however, attract newbies via a 4% yield. Assuming this can be honoured\u2026. We\u2019ll get more colour on BT\u2019s business on Friday, when it publishes its third-quarter financial results. Today\u2019s announcement was rushed out once the company had calculated the full cost of its Italian accounting problems. Under City rules, a company can\u2019t keep a problem of this magnitude to itself. Q: Why were the accounting irregularities BT Italy not discovered a lot sooner? BT says that it \u201cneeds to reflect\u201d on why they were not spotted by BT Italy\u2019s management, the wider Group, or by its auditors. But it is \u201cfar too premature\u201d to say anything about the auditors this morning This is turning into a full-blow rout: This is a \u201cdark day\u201d for BT, says city analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He says investors are selling up, on fears that there are deeper problems at the telecoms firm. The group\u2019s own investigation of accounting malpractice in its Italian business shows the situation is far worse than it first thought \u2013 the bill is now thought to be around \u00a3530m, well above the \u00a3145m initially forecast. According to BT, this will mean a reduction in Q3 adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA of around \u00a3120m. Free cash flow will be \u00a3100m worse off. For 2016/17 as a whole the problems will have a negative revenue impact of around \u00a3200m, while denting normalised free cash flow by up to \u00a3500m. The impact on 2017/18 is expected to be just as bad and that is likely to have a material impact on its ability to return cash to shareholders, although BT says it still expects to grow dividend per share by 10% in each of those years. The problem is that investors will fear that this is not the end \u2013 what else will be uncovered? The costs could yet rise and that fear is driving the selling this morning.\u201d BT\u2019s shares are now down 19%, which wipes \u00a36bn off its market capitalisation. The Italian business will need a lot of work before it can be a growth business, Patterson says, predicting that it has probably been unprofitable for a number of years. CEO Gavin Patterson also warns that BT is feeling the impact of higher inflation, so 2017 will be a lot tougher Q: Is BT now inspecting its other overseas businesses for signs of accounting problems? Yes, Patterson replies, and BT doesn\u2019t believe an issue like this exists elsewhere in its business. This accounting scandal appears to be \u201cspecific\u201d to the Italian business, he continues. It\u2019s a very complex set of manipulations, involving a lot of people over many years. As if BT didn\u2019t have enough problems right now, it is also warning that the UK market is slowing. The outlook for UK public sector and international corporate markets has deteriorated, says CEO Gavin Patterson. That is potentially down to the wider economy, and potentially down to the Brexit vote. BT CEO Gavin Patterson is briefing City analysts on a conference call now. I\u2019ve dialled in. Patterson says he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the inappropriate behaviour uncovered at BT Italy, and confirms that several executives have left the company after being suspended. Financial results have been overstated for several years, Patterson says, so BT is now working out the full impact on the overall Group\u2019s results. We take the situation at our Italian business extremely seriously, and are taking efforts to strengthen its procedures, Patterson continues. BT shares have hit their lowest level in two and a half years, and are on track for their worst day since the financial crisis of 2008. The City really isn\u2019t impressed by these serious accounting mistakes at the company\u2019s Italian arm. Boom! BT shares have plunged by 15% at the start of trading. That wipes more than \u00a35.5bn off the company\u2019s value, and sends it sprawling to the bottom of the FTSE 100. City analyst Louise Cooper says this scandal does not reflect well on the City: And this is from Reuters\u2019 Amanda Cooper: BT shares could tumble by 8% in early trading, warns City veteran David Buik. Telecoms group BT has just shocked the City by announcing that the accounting scandal at its Italian division is much worse than previously thought. The FTSE-listed company is slashing its revenue, earnings and free cash flow forecasts for this year, and next year. It has also suspended several senior executives from BT Italy who have already left the company. An investigation by KPMG has uncovered that \u201cthe extent and complexity of inappropriate behaviour in the Italian business were far greater than previously identified.\u201d KPMG found that the division used \u201cimproper accounting practices\u201d and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions. This has driven the cost of the scandal up to \u00a3530m, sharply higher than the \u00a3145m which BT announced in October. This is going to have a serious impact on BT\u2019s business. It is now predicting no revenue growth over the next two years, and cutting its guidance for EBITDA profits from \u00a37.9bn to \u00a37.6bn. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT Group, says: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed with the improper practices which we have found in our Italian business. We have undertaken extensive investigations into that business and are committed to ensuring the highest standards across the whole of BT for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, employees and all other stakeholders.\u201d BT has appointed a new boss of BT Italy. He takes charge on 1 February, and will work on improving the \u201cgovernance, compliance and financial safeguards in our Italian business\u201d. In short, this is pretty serious. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors in City have plenty to think about today. At 9.30am, the UK supreme court will rule on whether parliament must give its approval before Britain can begin its departure from the European Union. That news will be liveblogged in another place, but we\u2019ll be watching too as the decision will move the markets. Owen Bowcott, our legal affairs correspondent, explains how the ruling will affect the Brexit timetable: The ruling by the 11 justices will resolve whether the government, through its inherited use of royal prerogative powers, can formally initiate article 50 of the treaty on European Union (TEU) without the explicit approval of MPs and peers. Article 50 begins the process of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. If a majority of justices decide, as is widely expected, that parliamentary support is required, then the judgment could specify that legislation is needed. We also get the latest UK public finance figures at 9.30am, covering December. Economists predict that Britain borrowed around \u00a36.5bn to balance the books last month. Data firm Markit is reporting its latest PMI surveys for the eurozone this morning, showing how manufacturing and service companies are faring this month. Over in parliament, the Business, Innovations and Skills committee is holding a hearing into executive pay and boardroom diversity, also starting at 9.30am. They\u2019ll hear from Sir Philip Hampton who chaired a review into how to get more women into City boards, along with Baroness Sarah Hogg, Tom Gosling of PWC, Simon Fraser of Investor Forum, Ken Olisa of the Institute of Directors, and Andrew Ninian of Investment Association.",

Existing financial centre with low tax rates and flexible labour laws. Cons Property prices are high and an influx of bankers would push them higher. Limited transport links to the rest of the world, although good connections to Europe. Frankfurt Pros High quality of life; with good schools, low cost of living and nearby countryside. Angela Merkel\u2019s economic powerhouse already hosts key financial institutions, such as the European Central Bank. Cons Despite ample amenities, the city has a reputation for being quite boring. It\u2019s not big, with a population smaller than that of Leeds. Other countries may oppose greater German dominance of Europe\u2019s economic affairs. Paris Pros Good choice of international schools and the allure of being a genuine world city. International connectivity, via Charles de Gaulle airport. Cons France\u2019s reputation for high taxes on the rich and inflexible labour laws. Cultural resistance to accepting English as the de facto global language of business. Amsterdam Pros Plenty of available office space in one of Europe\u2019s best-connected cities. An emerging tech hub that has attracted the likes of Netflix, Tesla and Uber. Cons Dutch bonus cap limits bankers\u2019 bonuses to 20% of their annual salary. Even Dutch bank ING admits the city has a shortage of experienced finance professionals. Madrid Pros The city is considering tax breaks for international firms looking to relocate. Good business links to emerging Latin American markets, unlike most European cities.

This is up significantly on the 10.2% in the same period the previous year.</p> <p>Darroch blamed the jump in churn to the \u201chighly promotional\u201d and competitive UK market with broadband customers proving to be deal hunters more likely to switch to a rival.<br></p> <p>Sky is also launching a loyalty programme to \u201creward and recognise members\u201d based on how long they have been a customer as part of its strategy to stem customer churn.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sky UK, which accounts for more than 90% of the pan-European broadcaster\u2019s profits, experienced an 18% fall in profits to \u00a3620m in the second half of last year.</p> <p>Sky, which had a 9% fall in total profits across its business to \u00a3679m, said that it was a resilient performance, down \u00a365m year on year despite a \u00a3314m rise in Premier League rights costs.

We have extended deals with a whole range of companies. </p> <p>\u201cOne thing we will ask for is performance from our partners. The fact is [Discovery\u2019s] share of viewing on linear [TV] has been in long-term decline. When you look to the on-demand world, Discovery performs at best a third it does in linear. They are not hitting big shows people pay for.\u201d<br></p> <p>Darroch said its strategy in the upcoming battle for Champion\u2019s League TV rights, currently controlled by BT, would not be impacted by the potential takeover by the deep-pocketed Fox.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe go into all rights renewals this year in a good place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fox approach has no effect at all on that.

We will bid according to the value we attribute to [those] right[s].\u201d<br></p> <p>Sky also announced that it has secured the exclusive rights to England matches in the new Uefa Nations League, including qualifiers for Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Jeremy Darroch, the Sky chief executive, said it would allow Sky to target up to 6m households across Europe who cannot, or will not, have a satellite dish. \u201cThis is the first time we have been able to offer the full Sky TV service without a satellite dish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a big moment for the business.\u201d Customers can currently use the Now TV broadband service to watch a limited range of Sky channels without a dish, but the new offering will allow access to potentially all of its 270 channels. The initiative, which could open up about 2m homes in the UK for Sky to target, comes as the company revealed that the rate of customers defecting to rivals has climbed significantly. Sky said its churn rate, a key metric watched by the City, rose to 11.6% in the last six months of 2016. This is up significantly on the 10.2% in the same period the previous year. Darroch blamed the jump in churn to the \u201chighly promotional\u201d and competitive UK market with broadband customers proving to be deal hunters more likely to switch to a rival. Sky is also launching a loyalty programme to \u201creward and recognise members\u201d based on how long they have been a customer as part of its strategy to stem customer churn. Sky UK, which accounts for more than 90% of the pan-European broadcaster\u2019s profits, experienced an 18% fall in profits to \u00a3620m in the second half of last year. Sky, which had a 9% fall in total profits across its business to \u00a3679m, said that it was a resilient performance, down \u00a365m year on year despite a \u00a3314m rise in Premier League rights costs. Total revenues rose 6% to \u00a36.4bn. Darroch also said Sky would not back down in the face of the threat made by Discovery, which has 12 channels including Eurosport and Animal Planet, to pull its UK programming from the end of the month. Discovery says Sky is refusing to pay a \u201cfair price\u201d to air its channels and that it is using its \u201cdominant market position\u201d to pay it less than it received a decade ago. Darroch said Discovery\u2019s move to go public about the negotiations, which will result in the channels coming off Sky from 1 February if an 11th hour deal cannot be reached, was about \u201ccommercial self-interest\u201d. Pay-TV rivals have already voiced concerns about Sky\u2019s potential dominance of sport, TV and film if Fox\u2019s proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover is allowed by competition regulators. \u201cThis is a very real concern about being squeezed out of the market,\u201d said Susanna Dinnage, the managing director of Discovery Networks UK &amp; Ireland. \u201cWe have grave concerns about the impact on our business. We are in competition, in areas such as factual programming and sports rights, in the UK and Europe. There are a lot of lone voices out there, from consumers to other smaller broadcasters. We are one of the few people who can stand up and say enough is enough.\u201d Darroch distanced the breakdown in talks from a potential link with concerns of market dominance relating to the Fox/Sky deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think this has got anything to do with the approach by 21st Century Fox,\u201d said Darroch. \u201cWe have been talking to Discovery since April last year. We have extended deals with a whole range of companies. \u201cOne thing we will ask for is performance from our partners. The fact is [Discovery\u2019s] share of viewing on linear [TV] has been in long-term decline. When you look to the on-demand world, Discovery performs at best a third it does in linear. They are not hitting big shows people pay for.\u201d Darroch said its strategy in the upcoming battle for Champion\u2019s League TV rights, currently controlled by BT, would not be impacted by the potential takeover by the deep-pocketed Fox. \u201cWe go into all rights renewals this year in a good place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fox approach has no effect at all on that. We have good options. We always look incrementally at where we might seek to invest and get better. We go into Champions League renewal from a position of strength across all our markets. We will bid according to the value we attribute to [those] right[s].\u201d Sky also announced that it has secured the exclusive rights to England matches in the new Uefa Nations League, including qualifiers for Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup.",

                "bodyText":"At the height of the credit boom in 2005, a financier was sent by his boss to a corporate flat in Portman Square in London\u2019s West End. In his hand was an envelope containing about \u00a34,000 in cash for which he had been given specific instructions. He was to hand the package to a business contact called Lynden Scourfield, then a lead director of the HBOS\u2019s impaired assets division, who was expected to be entertaining guests in the apartment. Or, if the banker wasn\u2019t in residence, the cash was to be left for him in \u201cthe blue drawer\u201d, which referred to the spot that was also used to store Viagra for sex parties. That might all seem like the preamble for a new Netflix series, on which the scriptwriters still have to do a bit of work. But it was the scene-setter that greeted jurors at Southwark crown court in September, as they prepared to hear a fraud case relating to one of the crustiest of finance sectors, corporate banking. This is the seemingly tired old trade of lending money to businesses. Still, the narrative took the courtroom back to a financial period when almost any indulgence was encouraged \u2013 and was justified by unremarkable operators who assumed their own genius was making them rich. However, now it can be reported for the first time that Scourfield, 54, is corrupt, and pleaded guilty last year to six counts relating to his role in a scheme that cost the bank \u00a3245m. On Monday his business associate David Mills, 60, who ran a small business turnaround consultancy Quayside Corporate Services (QCS), Mills\u2019s wife. Alison, 51, plus their associates Michael Bancroft, 73, and Tony Cartwright, 72, were all convicted for their roles in helping to run Scourfield\u2019s scam. A sixth man, Mark Dobson, 56, who worked for Scourfield at HBOS, was also convicted, while one other defendant, Jonathan Cohen, 57, was acquitted. Despite his absence from the courtroom having changed his plea last year, Scourfield\u2019s presence loomed over proceedings each day of the four-month trial. The jury heard more lurid stories of those parties held in the London flat, which prompted one sex worker to comment on Scourfield\u2019s movie star looks (sadly for him, Danny de Vito). They also heard how, apart from funding the evening entertainments, Mills also applied to have a second card on his American Express account, which was issued under Scourfield\u2019s name.

He added that more than \u00a328m passed from HBOS through the bank accounts of either Mills, his wife or companies under his control \u2013 and while not all of that money stayed with the defendants, Mills and his wife \u201cdid benefit enormously\u201d. But who was hurt by all this? Lloyds Banking Group is one victim. It had taken over HBOS, was rescued by the taxpayer and was subsequently forced to write off \u00a3250m from its impaired assets division. Of that sum, \u00a3245m related to bank customers under Scourfield\u2019s management.
