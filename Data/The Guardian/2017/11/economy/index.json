We expect earnings season to propel stocks to further gains. However, signs of inflation and the potential of a melt-up do pose some risks.

On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned.</p> <p>Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event.</p> <p>When it comes to the statement, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d/0_0_2000_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Powell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Powell<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite. Prior to that he was Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. Before that he was a lawyer and investment banker in New York.</p> <p>The second candidate often mentioned is John Taylor, who was Treasury Under-Secretary for International Affairs, 2001- 2005, and who developed the Taylor Rule, discussed below, as a means of describing the way in which the Fed sets interest rates.</p> <p>While these two candidates are the current favourites, it is of course possible that somebody else will be appointed, or that Chair Yellen will be reappointed.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59f9f58357bca206682cbde1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-01T16:56:04.004Z\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets close mainly higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As US investors await the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision, most European markets have ended the first day of the new month on a positive note.</p> <p>Buoyed by weakness in the euro after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, French, German and Italian markets have closed in positive territory, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax in particular playing catch up after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public holiday.

                "bodyText":"Commenting on the Fed decision, Kully Samra, UK managing director of Charles Schwab, said: A widely expected move from the Fed with market consensus anticipating one further rate hike in December. A more aggressive Fed could have posed a problem for equities, but for now the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s methodical approach to monetary policy tightening is reassuring investors and ensuring the continuation of the bull run. The Fed has an important balancing act to play as it slowly continues to normalise monetary policy by gradually lifting interest rates and unwinding its bloated balance sheet. We expect earnings season to propel stocks to further gains. However, signs of inflation and the potential of a melt-up do pose some risks. The US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook is also bolstered by broadly strengthening global economic growth and the continued rise in global earnings may support further stock market gains. So on Thursday we are due to get the perhaps more important Fed news - Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick for the next chair of the US central bank. Also coming up is the Bank of England rate decision, which is widely expected to see the first rise for a decade. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One key point from the Fed statement. It says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In September it said economic activity \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been rising moderately so far this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slightly more positive comment adds to the idea of a rate rise in December. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comparison of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed statement with the September comments: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. And the comments about changes in rates are unchanged from the September meeting: In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking News: The Federal Reserve has kept US interest rates on hold, as expected, but left open the prospect of an increase at its December meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING from earlier today on the Fed: The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate decision is due in less than an hour, and while no change is expected this time round, analysts will be looking for clues as to whether a rise is nailed on for December. Given the relatively strong economic data recently, this seems fairly probable, but the observers will be looking out for clues from the nuances of the accompanying statement. In some ways the Fed decision is not the most important event for the US central bank this week. On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned. Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event. When it comes to the statement, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to. Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December. Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair: The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite. Prior to that he was Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. Before that he was a lawyer and investment banker in New York. The second candidate often mentioned is John Taylor, who was Treasury Under-Secretary for International Affairs, 2001- 2005, and who developed the Taylor Rule, discussed below, as a means of describing the way in which the Fed sets interest rates. While these two candidates are the current favourites, it is of course possible that somebody else will be appointed, or that Chair Yellen will be reappointed. As US investors await the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision, most European markets have ended the first day of the new month on a positive note. Buoyed by weakness in the euro after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, French, German and Italian markets have closed in positive territory, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax in particular playing catch up after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public holiday. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex, however, has edged lower on profit taking after its recent gains, which were prompted by fading fears about the Catalan independence demands. The FTSE 100 slipped back despite a positive performance from the mining sector after Chinese manufacturing data. Next proved a drag on the index after its badly received results, and helped pull other retailers lower as well. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher ahead of the Fed news. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 5.12 points or 0.07% to 7487.96 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.78% to 13,465.51 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.2% at 5514.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.87% at 22,991.99 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.16% at 10,506.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.02% to 767.07 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently up 49 points or 0.21%. The main focus for US investors is the Federal Reserve meeting later - widely expected to keep rates on hold but hit at an increase in December - and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick for the next Fed chair. Meanwhile the US economic data continues to be strong. As well as the reasonable manufacturing data, there were also some positive jobs numbers, ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official non-farm payroll numbers. The monthly ADP report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, better than the 200,000 figures analysts had been expecting. It was also much better than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 110,000 figure, albeit this was revised down from the initial estimate of a 135,000 increase. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was a pretty strong afternoon for US data. The ADP non-farm employment change reading hit 235k, sharply higher than last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 110k, to set up a potentially massive \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcofficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 number on Friday, while the final Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in a tad higher than forecast at 54.6. Only the ISM manufacturing figure disappointed, and even then, at 58.7, it was a more than respectable number. The dollar was the main beneficiary of all this (the Dow Jones lost roughly a third of its early gains, though after rising 100 points it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at a fresh all time high). The greenback reversed its initial losses against the pound to climb 0.1%-0.2%, sending cable back below $1.33, while against the euro it jumped 0.2%. This reaction was assumedly related to the hawkish-tinge of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, with investors hoping the Federal Reserve tees up a December rate hike with this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Estate agent Jones Lang LaSalle has just published its latest forecasts for UK house price growth in the next five years. It has pencilled in an average of 2.5% growth a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from an average of 6.9% in the last 20 years. The firm is predicting a big shift to a more stable housing market with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more moderate UK house price growth over the next five to ten years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - despite Brexit. Growth is expected to average just 1% next year but then pick up to 2% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020, 3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022. Transactions are also set to slow, averaging 1.23m a year over the next five years. The firm said: Brexit will not get in the way of a more stable and healthy UK housing market. In central London we expect demand for new developments to remain muted but steady over the next two years until the Brexit road becomes clearer. A bedrock of demand will continue from domestic owner-occupiers supported by a steady stream of international buyers and investors. Activity in prime central London will be subdued for the next two years with continued pressure on pricing especially at the top end of the market where stamp duty impacts are greatest. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector continues to be rattled by Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are certainly out of fashion, down 8.5% right now at the bottom of the FTSE 100 losers column. Other retailers are sharing the gloom; Marks &amp; Spencer have lost 4%, Dixons Carphone have lost 2%, and Ocado are down 1.9%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d all be vulnerable to a slowdown in consumer spending (which might accelerate if the Bank of England raises interest rates tomorrow). Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors are worried that Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street sales slumped by 7.7% over the last quarter. These results are a reflection of the wider issues facing the retail sector. Investors continue to face challenges to their spending power as well as the structural shift to online shopping. Moreover, the vagaries of the British weather have only proved to be a hindrance. We have in general been fairly pessimistic towards the retail sector and nothing has really changed that sentiment. Over in Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has announced that Athens is likely to make at least four market forays before its current bailout programme expires next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a late night interview, the Oxford-educated finance minister confirmed reports that Greece was poised to tap bond markets again saying the foray was a purposeful move to improve the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt profile. He told the state new channel ERT-1 that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue is to have access to markets when we exit the programme,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a bid to prepare the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and make Greek bonds more attractive - Athens plans at least four market forays in the run up to August 2018 when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn euro aid programme officially ends. To boost liquidity the government is considering swapping twenty bonds issued in 2012 after a restructuring of Greek debt held by private investors for four or five new bonds. Hinting that a test run was imminent, Tskakalotos said investors would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand [Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] return\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to bond markets before international auditors representing creditors at the EU and IMF, wrap up a third compliance review as part of the bailout programme. The review is expected to be completed by January after inspectors return to the country at the end of November. Once concluded, Greece will start negotiating the terms of its exit from international supervision. At 180 % of GDP, Greece has the highest debt load in the EU. There are also reports that a senior EU official in Brussels has suggested that debt relief could be linked to further reforms once the current bailout programme ends. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector appears to be in good health, says Michael Pierce of Capital Economics. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing data: The small drop back in the ISM Manufacturing Index in October from a 13-year high is little to worry about, and still suggests that manufacturing output will rebound in the fourth quarter. The drop back in the headline index, from 60.8 to 58.7, took it back almost exactly in line with its value in August. Perversely, some of the decline in the index this month reflects an unwinding of hurricane effects. The disruption to supply chains caused delivery times to surge in September (interpreted in the ISM index as a positive sign of stronger demand), which was partly reversed last month. ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival US manufacturing survey is also out, and it suggests growth slowed but remained very strong: Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is expanding at its fastest rate since January. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US manufacturing PMI rose to 54.6 in October, up from 53.1 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortably over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. US factory bosses also reported that they took on more staff last month, at the fastest pace in over two years. This comes hot on the heels of some other strong jobs data today, showing that US firms hired staff at the fastest rate in 18 months. Wall Street traders have held a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence as a mark of respect for those who were killed in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truck attack in New York. Trading is now underway, and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have both hit new record highs as the market rally continues. Labour MP Wes Streeting says the government must heed the warning that 75,000 City jobs could be lost through Brexit, and avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure from the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that British companies are already preparing to shift jobs abroad as a result of Brexit. Our economy is being damaged now, with growth slowing and prices rising, and the situation is set to get worse as a hard and destructive Brexit gets closer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only by keeping Britain in the Single Market can the Government reassure financial services firms and stem job losses. But they have made an ideological choice to wrench our country out of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were told that Brexit would not lead to job losses. As people see the harm that is being done to our economy, they have every right to keep on open mind on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the House of Lords, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe has warned that the regulation of financial clearing houses could suffer after Brexit. These clearing houses sit between investors, settling trades, and (hopefully) avoiding financial contagion breaking out. European officials argue that they should supervise euro clearing (much of which takes place in London today). But Cunliffe fears this would lead to disruption. He told the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to make sure you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up with multiple hands on the steering wheel and multiple feet on the brake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BoE is also concerned that huge numbers of cross-border derivative contracts and insurance policies would be disrupted by Brexit. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there could be no agreement on how these derivatives contracts are regulated. Deputy governor Sam Woods says negotiators need to find a solution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By far the best fix would be for something to be included in the withdrawal bill. There would have to be bilateral agreement to fix this on both sides.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite fears over Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Anglo-Irish trade, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer exports to the UK are up by 12%, it emerged today. Enterprise Ireland said the export of Irish consumer goods and services is now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m. The Irish government business agency puts a lot of the rise in exports to Britain down to better use of online sales and other innovations. Allyson Stephen, market advisor at Enterprise Ireland said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a crowded market such as Britain, knowing your market is essential before targeting buyers and while there are similarities between Irish and British consumers, in a business context there are vital differences, such as continuous and new and developing routes to market which must be recognised. Back in the City, Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares ares still down over 7% after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing sales update. That, by my maths, wipes \u00c2\u00a3540m off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation, from \u00c2\u00a37.17bn to around \u00c2\u00a36.6bn. That makes Next the worst performing stock on the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies). My colleague Angela Monaghan explains what went wrong: Investors took fright on Thursday after Next reported a fall in high street sales and warned trading was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of its crucial Christmas selling period. Next shares fell by 8%, making it the biggest loser on the FTSE 100, after the clothing retailer said sales at its shops fell by 7.7% in the three months to 29 October. Thanks to a 13.2% increase in Directory sales, including online, total sales for full-price items rose by 1.3% over the quarter. However, some analysts had been expecting total sales growth of more than 4%. More here: Another deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, tells the Lords committee that City firms will assume a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario on Brexit, unless they can see what the final \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcend framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a deal will be. Simply agreeing a transition period, with no clarity about what the final agreement might be, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough..... Over at the House of Lords, Sam Woods, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has told peers that 10,000 City jobs could be lost on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit. Testifying to the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, Woods also says that the BoE believes it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plausible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that up to 75,000 roles could go in the long-term, as consultancy Oliver Wyman has estimated. Woods, who runs the regulatory arm of the Bank, has already asked 400 banks and financial firms for their contingency plans in the event of a hard Brexit. He said that some of those plans were already being put in place - reserving school places, hiring office space etc - but that plans would be put in place in earnest in the first quarter of the year. You can watch the session online here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news highlights the dilemma facing the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers, as they try to decide whether to raise interest rates tomorrow. On one side, they have one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailers reporting weak, volatile sales - a sign that consumers are vulnerable and cutting back. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to leave borrowing costs unchanged. On the other, they can see Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories growing steadily, with production rising and - perhaps crucially for the BoE - price pressures rising. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to raise borrowing costs towards more normal levels, probably bolstering the pound and pulling inflation down. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out at noon on Thursday whether the Monetary Policy Committee has voted for its first interest rate rise in a decade.... Importantly, UK factories which produce consumer goods are lagging behind the rest of the sector, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. Markit says: Intermediate and investment goods producers both saw rising production volumes backed up by strong and accelerated intakes of new business. Conditions seemed less firm in the consumer goods category, however, as growth of new orders eased to a seven-month low and business optimism to its weakest level in the year-to-date. The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers grew at a faster pace in October has cheered industry experts and City economists. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see the manufacturing sector holding strong and steady in October, buoyed up by an increase in new orders from the domestic market and improving on last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. While trade from export markets slowed slightly, orders from overseas continued to rise for the 18th month supported by a robust global economy. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuating performance may have had some bearing on the softening in export orders, but there were continuing good levels of demand from Europe and the USA so no cause for concern. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK manufacturing sector has recorded another month well above the magic 50 mark that signifies growth and continues to perform well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the ongoing Brexit negotiations are causing uncertainty, recent CBI data shows orders and outputs are above historic levels, and similar trends are seen in exporting data. Firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans for investment in innovation remain strong, as does spending on training and development. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Month after month, manufacturing continues to hold its own delivering growth levels that keep the sector in positive territory. Although demand from both home and overseas markets remains robust, manufacturers will have half an eye on what the MPC decides to do tomorrow and the potential impact an interest rate rise would have on sterling. They will also be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement and what that may bring by way of a boost for the sector and I suspect many will be looking for R&amp;D tax credits to feature and encourage a much needed increase in investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister will be pleased to see an above-expectations hike in manufacturing output in October, particularly after a bigger than expected fall the month prior. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153British business is still trying to balance Brexit uncertainty against a weak currency-led boost to exports, but with the sterling creeping upwards of late, foreign demand may not hold for long. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say whether UK industry is out the woods just yet, with pressure on the sector likely to persist until more political clarity is found both domestically and on the continent. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While UK exports have increased in recent months, levels have yet to reach the heights that the devalued Sterling and strengthening economic performance in the Eurozone and global markets promised. Clearly, British manufacturers are prioritising profit margins over exports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of visibility over the future direction of Brexit negotiations is holding back major investment initiatives in the sector that might have boosted productivity. Without a clearer picture to support those decisions, there are concerns that UK manufacturing will fall behind in the global technology race and struggle to compete. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Input costs continue to weigh down on margins and a possible uptick in the interest rate from the Bank of England will add further pressure. Businesses will need to be vigilant of a potential rise in financial risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK manufacturing PMI report has pushed the pound over $1.33 for the first time in two weeks. Breaking! UK factories grew faster than expected last month, thanks to a surge in new orders. Data firm Markit reports that manufacturing output and new order growth remained robust in October, suggesting that the weak pound is helping factories. However, the fall in sterling is also pushing up the cost of raw materials, and finished products too. Markit says: The UK manufacturing sector started the final quarter of the year on a solid footing. Production and new order volumes continued to rise at robust rates, as companies benefited from strong domestic market conditions and rising inflows of new export business. Price pressures remained elevated, however, with rates of inflation in input costs and output charges both accelerating and staying well above historical series averages. This rise in output pushed the UK manufacturing PMI up to 56.3, which shows stronger growth. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading has been revised higher too. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturing made an impressive start to the final quarter of 2017 as increased inflows of new work encouraged firms to ramp up production once again. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says the 7.7% slide in Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street sales over the last quarter is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsickening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He writes: If such a distinguished guru as Simon Wolfson of Next finds it impossible to read the underlying sales trends, because of the volatility of the weather, then what are we mere mortals to do?... Some people in the City expected full-price sales to be nearly 4.5% up in Q3, driven by Next Directory, but the outcome was only +1.3%, with Next Retail down a sickening 7.7% and Next Directory up 13.2% Global Data retail analyst Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien wonders whether Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online ordering system can help: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBC reporter Clodagh Rice: The stock market can be cruel at times. So says George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third quarter performance is actually better than what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen from the group so far this year, but with many expecting a much stronger showing, the shares still took a tumble. While the recent investment in digital marketing seems to have helped the Directory division rediscover its mojo, Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street stores saw an almighty slump this quarter. A particularly weak October means the group enters the all-important Christmas period with less momentum than it would have liked. Salmon add that other retailers could be nervous too... Shareholders in Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, might now be a bit more nervous ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year numbers. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly, ugly morning for Next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says recent positive noises from the company have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come back to haunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures have punctured the optimism that had built up recently. Campbell adds: While Q3 total sales grew 1.3%, an improvement on the 2.2% decline seen in the first half of the year, that was lower than the 2.9% growth expected as the firm warned on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sector landscape. Similarly, though Directory sales rocketed 13.2% higher, retail (i.e. high street) sales plunged a far worse than estimated 7.7%, leading Next to revise its annual pre-tax profit forecasts from \u00c2\u00a3687m-\u00c2\u00a3747m to \u00c2\u00a3692m-\u00c2\u00a3742m. None of these were particularly bad figures; but the expectation created by the past few updates meant these Q3 results couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but disappoint, causing the stock to sink 7.5% to a 7 week nadir. Shares in Next have tumbled by almost 8% at the start of trading. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 368p at \u00c2\u00a345.52. That confirms that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are weaker than the City expected. Other retailers are also suffering, with Marks &amp; Spencer down 3.7% and Associated British Foods (which owns Primark) down 2.5%. UK high street retailer Next has spooked the City by missing its sales forecasts and warning that trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Next, one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key retailers, has reported that sales at its stores shrank by 7.7% in the three months to 29th October. Although directory sales (including online) rose by 13.2%, this means Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total full-price sales only increased by 1.3% over the quarter. Some analysts had expected growth of 4%, so this is a new signal that the UK high street could be weakening. Recent warm weather has hurt clothing retailers, as it has discouraged shoppers from splashing out on a new winter coat. Next says: Sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather. In August and September sales were significantly up on last year, as cooler temperatures improved sales of warmer weight stock. The change in sales trend came at precisely the same time UK temperatures became warmer than last year. But there are also signs that rising inflation, which is outstripping wage growth, is hurting shoppers. Next admits that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on out there: Week by week sales volatility makes it very hard to determine any underlying sales trend. We believe the most reliable guide to sales for the balance of the year are the full price sales for the year to date, which are down -0.3%. Despite the sales slowdown, Next is hoping to make pre-tax profits of \u00c2\u00a3692m to \u00c2\u00a3742m for this financial year. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK manufacturing has a surprisingly good summer, expanding by 1% during the third quarter of 2017 (according to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report). Today we discover whether it maintained that momentum in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because data firm Markit are releasing their latest purchasing managers reports, showing how factories around the world fared last month. Economists predict a solid reading from the UK, with its manufacturing PMI tipped to remain unchanged at 55.9. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities believe the numbers could move the pound: Earlier in the day investors will want to pay attention to the Manufacturing PMI release from the UK which comes a day before tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting on monetary policy. The pound has gained considerably over the past two days as expectations are set for the BoE to hike rates this month and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI release could set the stage for more gains. Royal Bank of Canada say: There was a loss of momentum generally last month in many of the activity sub-components of these surveys but the manufacturing sector is looking the most buoyant. Alas, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until tomorrow to find how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories performed. Nationwide, the estate agent, has reported that house prices rose by 0.2% last month (more on that shortly). Over in America, the Federal Reserve is holding a policy meeting - but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting an interest rate rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI for October 10am GMT: Bank of England deputy governors Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods testify to the House of Lords EU financial affairs committee. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFinancial regulation and supervision following Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 1.30pm GMT: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI for October 2pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for October 6pm GMT: Federal Reserve interest rate decision",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat graphic summing up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK car sales figures: And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Brent crude has now hit a 28-month high, at almost $64 per barrel, as the shockwaves from the Saudi \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorruption crackdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ripple through the oil market. The purge of Saudi princes and officials has sparked speculation that instability in Saudi Arabia could affect oil supplies in the future. Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, explained to Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The geopolitical supply risk premium is starting to bear its head in the market right now because OPEC supply cuts have made it relevant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loewen added that, with supply capped and demand rising, potential risks to supply become more significant. The drop in UK car sales didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter City traders from pushing the Footsie to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing high. Energy firms rose, tracking the oil price after Brent crude hit that two-year high this morning. Mining firms also had a good day, thanks to a pickup in the copper price. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Arguably, the UK index should have done better given the showing from its commodity stocks. BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 1% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $62.50 for the first time in 2 years following an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanti-corruption\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blitz from Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with investors barrelling into the commodity as they weighed up the potentially destabilising effect this will have on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil output. Copper also got a boost this Monday, surging 1.2% as the markets got to grips with the idea that the metal will see a sharp increase in demand as electric vehicles becomoe more popular. This in turn led the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miners higher, with Riot Tinto up 1.7%, Anglo American up 2% and BHP Billiton up 2.7%. After a quiet trading session, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has nudged up to a new all-time closing high. The blue-chip index gained just two points today, having also hit a closing high on Friday. However, the picture is less rosy when you adjust for the weaker pound..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the latest drop in UK car sales, for those just tuning in: New car sales have declined for the seventh month in a row, falling more than 12% in October as worsening confidence among consumers and businesses continues to dampen the market. The figures show that the car market is on course for its first annual decline since 2011 and will continue to fall next year before stabilising in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The industry body said car registrations dropped 12.2% year-on-year to 158,192 last month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second double-digit decline this year. It is an acceleration from the 9.3% fall in car sales in September, the first time the market had declined in September in six years. In April, sales plummeted 19.8% after an increase in vehicle excise duty. Diesel sales tumbled by nearly 30% last month after the scandal over rigging emissions tests and political rumblings over restrictions on diesel cars. Demand for electric and hybrid cars continued to rise, up by nearly 37% to 8,244, while petrol models posted a small increase of 2.7%. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market, but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low-emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Labour MP Chuka Umunna MP has warned that the drop in UK car sales shows that Brexit is hurting the economy. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet more evidence that the Brexit squeeze is already hitting working people and businesses alike. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c directly caused by the Brexit vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has forced up prices and interest rates, deterring people from buying big-ticket items like cars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British people were promised that leaving the EU would make us better off, when in truth it is hitting growth, raising prices, and squeezing family budgets. Voters have the right to keep an open mind about our future when they see that the darkening reality is so far away from the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunny rhetoric.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US stock market has opened for trading after a silence for the victims of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Texas church shooting... ..... and the Nasdaq index has hit yet another record high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to Broadcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by over 4%, while Broadcom are up 2%. There are reports that Qualcomm will reject Broadcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances, which is pitched at a 28% premium to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. After hitting a two-year high this morning, Brent crude still up - and trading at $62.30 per barrel. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the shake-up and crackdown in Saudi Arabia is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind Brent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Last week the Saudi Arabian oil minister said that he supported another Opec production cut, set to be announced when Opec next meets later this month. This weekend an anti-corruption drive by Prime Mohammad bin Salman has seen the arrest of the well-known champion of capitalism Prime Alwaleed bin Talal among other officials and has rattled investors, stock exchanges across the Middle East have fallen at the start of this week. However, this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt the oil price as yet. The reason that Brent has rallied even when other Saudi-based assets have struggled, could be two-fold: the extension of the Opec production cut is a powerful driver of oil in the short term, and Brent could be acting as a safe haven in the midst of the confusion around the anti-corruption drive and Prime Mohammad bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shifting economic agenda.

The DAX and the CAC 40 saw fresh record highs last week, while the FTSE 100 hit a multi-month high, so a small pullback today is hardly surprising. Over in America, the New York Federal Reserve has confirmed that its president, William Dudley, is retiring early next year. That means more upheaval at the US Federal Reserve, just a few days after Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chair next year. The drop in the value of the pound since the 2016 EU referendum is an important factor in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falling car sales. So argues Ana Nicholls, Automotive Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a question of drooping consumer confidence - the economics of the car market have also changed in the past few months. With the pound so low, carmakers can no longer afford to use the kind of discounting and offers they have been using to keep the market buoyant. The diesel market, meanwhile, has been hit by the threat of regulation and higher levies in the wake of the emissions scandal. She adds that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise (the first in a decade) will also dampen demand for new cars. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the market, either, given that 86% of all cars are bought on credit - many of them on personal contract plans. Total car loans now stand at nearly \u00c2\u00a360bn. Although credit will remain cheap in historic terms, lenders will be forced to pass on the interest rate rise sooner or later. Sales of vans in the UK have also fallen sharply, mirroring the slump in car sales last month. The SMMT reports that light commercial vehicle sales fell by 7.4% last month; another sign that British businesses are suffering a drop in confidence. Sales of smaller vans (lighter than two tonnes) suffered a sharp decline, tumbling by 20% compared to October 2016 SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political and economic uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has dented business confidence, discouraging firms from splashing out on a new vehicle. Newsflash from America: Semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom has launched a $130bn takeover bid to take control of smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm. If the deal goes though, it could be the biggest technology takeover ever, says the Financial Times. Both companies are major players in the market for wireless communications chips for mobile phones. Combining them would create the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel and Samsung, according to Bloomberg. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is now addressing the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference. On Brexit, he says the UK needs to agree a transition deal soon. Delaying a transition deal until the final Brexit deal has been agreed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Corbyn (something BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gavin Patterson presumably agrees with). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging the speech in his Politics Live blog: The chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, has warned the government that it only has a couple of months to agree a transitional Brexit deal, before firms start to vote with their feet. Patterson says companies will start enacting their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit plans from the start of next year, when the value of a transitional deal to leave the EU begins to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deteriorate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for firms. Speaking at the CBI conference in London he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Clarity on transitional arrangements] That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very urgent at this moment. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll all start planning and implementing a hard Brexit scenario which is not going to be very good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked when the value of a transitional deal becomes of less use, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The beginning of next calendar year it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to begin to deteriorate in value. Ultimately the planning horizon, of most businesses I certainly talk to, is the order of a year to 18 months. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have certainty at that point you have to start planning for a worst case scenario.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the City, shares in car dealership Inchcape have fallen by 2.7% this morning, to the lowest level since mid-July. Traders seem to be reacting to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak UK car sales figures, say analysts at MorningStar: Simon Benson of AA Cars says the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on older \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirty diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cars is having a major impact - with sales down 30% year on year in October. Benson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite registrations of alternatively fuelled vehicles rising and a slight uplift in sales of petrol cars, the overall market was down by more than 12% last month as these efforts failed to balance out diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the widespread uncertainty and general confusion surrounding diesels and the potential for charges and restrictions in London and other major cities, a distinct lack of buyer confidence is the primary reason for this dramatic drop. Back in July, the government outlined plans to ban new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040, as part of a crackdown on air pollution. Industry figures have hoped that consumers would move to Euro 6 diesels (which heat Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new, tougher emission standards). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, though, suggests that many are shunning diesels, amid signs that the second-hand value of older diesels has slumped. Back in the eurozone, optimism among investors has hit its highest level in a decade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Sentix, the research group. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone investor confidence gauge soared to 34 this month, up from 29.7 in October . That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck). Sentix also found that investor sentiment towards Germany has hit an all-time high, following its strong growth this year (as highlighted by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory orders figures). Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons the decline in UK car sales shows that the Bank of England was wrong to raise UK interest rates last week. Alex Buttle of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that diesel car sales have slumped by 30% year-on-year. He blames the emissions scandal, in which manufacturers used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheat software\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to hide how much pollution they were creating. With Paris planning to ban diesels by 2024, consumers seem to be voting with their wallets. Buttle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures make depressing reading for the car industry. Petrol and alternative fuel figures were actually up in October, but diesel sales continue to flounder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share is plummeting and consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listening to rhetoric about cleaner diesel models, however much the industry drums on about it. The damage has been done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable the SMMT is not deserting diesel and urging the government to act to reassure consumers that new diesel cars will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from toxin tax punishment, is this a lost cause? Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time focus is shifted towards giving attractive tax incentives for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles to encourage growth in this area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers are showing huge interest in eco-friendly cars and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflected in new registrations. AFVs are the future of the car industry and the government need to adapt to changing times if it has any interest in keeping the new car market buoyant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The outlook for UK car sales looks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bleak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He says that the 12.2% slump in October is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alarming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and shows that consumers are very reluctant to make financial commitments at present. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, from 0.25% to 0.5%, could also hurt demand, he fears. Tombs writes: Worryingly, sales are falling rapidly even though generous discounts are available for buyers trading in old, high-polluting diesel vehicles. Most manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 diesel scrappage schemes are set to close at the end of this year. The recent further decline in consumer confidence, meanwhile, indicates that car registrations will continue to fall well into 2018. The downward trend likely will be amplified by increases in personal loan rates in response to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Rate hike. Accordingly, the outlook for car sales looks bleak. This chart highlights how sharply UK car sales have declined this year: Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at the Unite union, blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchaos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 around Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union: The fall in UK car sales has accelerated over the last three months, making October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year-on-year decline the biggest since April: January: +2.9% February: -0.3% March: +8.4% April: -19.8% May: -8.5% June: -4.8% July: -9.3% August: -6.4% September: -9.3% October: - 12.2% (because of monthly fluctuations, UK car sales are compared to the same month a year ago). Although diesel sales slumped, Britons actually bought more electric cars in October. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 36.9% year-on-year, with 8,244 new models registered during the month. That pushed sales of AFV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s through the 100,000 mark, up from around 75,000 a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! UK car sales declined by 12.2% in October, as the slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry continues. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153falling confidence among buyers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the slump that began in April continues. Car sales to businesses shrank by 26.8%, suggesting that firms are cutting back on their spending. Sales to individual private buyers shrank by 10%, in a sign that customers are more cautious in the face of rising inflation and falling wages. Diesel sales took a particular hit, shrinking by almost 30%, while petrol sales rose a little. Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures: UK new car market declines again in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down -12.2% to 158,192 units. Heavy losses for diesel as demand falls by almost a third, with -29.9% fewer registrations. Year to date registrations decrease -4.6%. This means that UK car sales have fallen by 4.6% in 2017, compared to 2016, with 2,224,603 cars registered since January. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, wants the government to reassure people that diesel has a future: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK. We urge the Government to use the forthcoming Autumn Budget to restore stability to the market, encouraging the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles as fleet renewal is the fastest and most effective way of addressing air quality concerns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every weekday morning, Business Today delivers the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics direct to your inbox.

The French private sector grew at its fastest pace in over six years in October, according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. Service sector firms and manufacturers both reported that activity was strong, pulling the French \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up to 57.4 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Germany companies also posted solid growth - although not quite as fast as in September. The German composite PMI dropped to 56.7, from 57.7. Italy, though, came off the boil, with the slowest rise in service sector growth since last autumn. The oil price has hit a two-year high this morning. Brent crude is changing hands at $62.50 per barrel, up 0.7%, which may lead to higher fuel and energy prices this winter. This follows the news that eleven Saudi princes have been arrested as part of a sweeping purge, which seems to strengthen crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This is significant for the energy market, as prince Mohammed supports extending the current output curbs agreed by the Opec cartel. Edward Bell, an analyst at Emirates Nbd Bank Pjsc, explains (via Boomberg): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producers and exporters undergoes a transformation of its economy, some uncertainty and political risk is bound to be encountered along the way, which would be supportive for prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has beaten expectations again. German factory orders rose by 1% in September, surprising economists who expected them to fall by 1.5%. This was driven by a jump in orders for capital goods - expensive machinery and equipment. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already sparkling data has also been revised up, to show a 4.1% jump in orders - up from a previous estimate of 3.6%. It suggests that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to grow strongly. 2017 is turning into the strongest year for the eurozone since the financial crisis struck. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski is impressed.... .. as is Fred Ducrozet of Pictet bank. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales figures come at a nervous time for the auto industry. Last month, car dealership chain Pendragon shocked the City with an unexpected profits warning which sent its shares careering to a four-year low. Car makers are also worrying about Brexit, as they currently benefit from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the single market and the customs union. Production across the industry has fallen for the last five months, with new investment on hold until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Vauxhall is already planning to swing the axe, with 400 jobs going at its site in Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has struggled in 2017, with sales falling steadily since April. New figures released today will show that the slump continued last month. Sales are expected to have fallen by around 12% year-on-year in October, following a 9% decline in September. Such a steep decline will surely fuel worries over the UK economy and consumer confidence. Diesel cars sales are likely to have tumbled particularly sharply, due to the fallout from the recent emissions scandal. The official figures are due at 9am, but preliminary data has already been released, as Reuters explains: British new car sales in October fell by about 12 percent year on year, marking a seventh consecutive month of decline, preliminary data released by an industry body showed on Monday. Sales were hurt by a decline in business and consumer confidence, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders(SMMT) said. Demand for diesel cars slumped by about 30 percent, the industry body said. The SMMT urged the government to use this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn budget to restore stability to the market and encourage the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles. Also coming up today: Data firm Markit will release a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service companies. Growth probably held up well in October, with the headline PMI expected to remain at 54.9. European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, with the FTSE 100 called down 13 points from Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing high. Plus, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business chiefs are gathering in London for the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from prime minister Theresa May and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Corbyn. Expect lots of talk about Brexit...

                "bodyText":"And finally..... Sky News has an interesting tale about Brexit and the banking sector.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The boss of JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd warned Theresa May and Philip Hammond on Wednesday that the French government is intensifying efforts to lure British banking jobs across the Channel, even as he hailed greater clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Brexit planning. Sky News has learnt that Jamie Dimon, the Wall Street banking giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdchairman and chief executive, held private talks with the Prime Minister and Chancellor in Downing Street on Wednesday. It was the latest in a series of meetings between one of the global banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful ex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdecutives and British Cabinet ministers amid efforts to persuade the Government to provide firm evidence of how it intends a transition period to work. Sources familiar with the meeting, which was also attended by Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment bank globally, said the bankers had committed to retaining \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a large proportion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of their existing UK operations after Brexit. JPMorgan employs roughly 15,000 people in the UK. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the pressure building on UK wages as firms struggle to find staff: In the media world, one of Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key allies has sold his stake in the mogul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox. The move could strengthen those shareholders who are unhappy about the Murdoch clan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domination of the group, and agitating for change. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who controls the investment firm Kingdom Holding and is one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest men, at one stage owned more than 6% of Fox and has consistently backed the Murdochs in shareholder votes about the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control of the company. He has been a shareholder in Murdoch companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including Fox and News Corp, the owner of the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for two decades and expressed public support for the family after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World in 2011. Regulatory filings in New York show Prince Alwaleed reduced his stake to 4.98% in December 2015, and an analysis of Bloomberg data shows the stake has fallen to zero since the end of the last financial quarter, on 30 September. It is not clear why he sold the stake or to whom. The sale represents the loss of an ally for the Murdochs and adds an extra twist to reports this week that Fox held talks with Disney about selling most of the company... More here: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index, the FTSE 100, has closed 16 points higher at 7529 Unions have warned they will not accept job cuts if the proposed merger between SSE and NPower goes through. UNISON national energy officer Matt Lay says staff are feeling pretty nervous following the tie-up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bolt from the blue will have left many of the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 employees feeling decidedly anxious. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the merger only just announced, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no detail yet as to the number of jobs that may go, the posts most affected, or the sites at risk. Stock markets are taking a breather today, it seems. Wall Street has opened calmly, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all dipping slightly. Snap, the social platform, has slumped by 10% though after posting disappointing results last night. It is now planning to redesign its app, after failing to hit analyst forecasts for user growth or revenues. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tencent, which operates the Wechat messaging platform WeChat, has now built a more than $2bn stake in Snap.... In London, the FTSE 100 is up 11 points, or +0.1%, while the French CAC is down 0.2% and the German DAX is unchanged. The pound has been under pressure today as traders try to keep up with another day of political drama in the UK. International development secretary Priti Patel is flying back to the UK as the row over her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking holiday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Israel escalates. Could she be sacked today? Has she already been fired? Political hacks are glued to Flightradar24 for the latest. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson is in familiar hot water too, facing calls to quit after wrongly stating last week that imprisoned UK citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalist in Iran. It all leaves Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government looking anything but strong and stable, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great for sterling. The pound is down 0.5% at $1.3105 vs the dollar, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1305 against the euro. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound slipped against the dollar and the euro today as the next round of Brexit negotiations approach, amid fresh political controversy at Westminster. Progress in negotiations has so far remained incremental, but the markets are hopeful on the back of renewed discussion of a transition period from the government. Following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations that resulted in the resignation of the defence secretary, fresh controversy over Secretary of State for International Development Priti Patel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct overseas and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have put immense pressure on Downing Street. If the situation worsens today sterling could potentially be pressured lower. Irish house prices inflation has hit a two-year high, driving prices back to their highest level since the financial crisis. House prices across the Republic rose by 12.8% per annum in September, up from 11.8% in August. The Central Statistics Office explains: Dublin house prices increased 12.4%. Apartments in Dublin increased 11.4% in the same period. The highest house price growth was in Dublin City, at 13.9%. In contrast, the lowest growth was in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, with house prices rising 9.9%. This pushes the CSO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of Irish house prices up to 99.9, a whisker away from their level in 2005, and the highest level since April 2009. If British firms do cut back on investment, it will make it even harder to hit the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research and development goals. The UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to get R&amp;D spending up to to the OECD target of 2.4% within a decade, and to 3% in the long term. But in 2015, UK R&amp;D spending was \u00c2\u00a331.6bn, or just 1.7% of GDP - well shy of the target. A report issued yesterday by The Royal Society showed how Britain is lagging behind. The report warned: Increasing overall R&amp;D investment is the target. To deliver this we need to create a vibrant environment that fosters research and innovation throughout UK public services, universities, charities and businesses and attracts global investment, incentivising companies to locate their R&amp;D here. A strategic approach, alongside an Industrial Strategy, will be key to realising our ambition. Only by doing this will we improve the health and wealth of the nation. UK recruitment firms say British employers are having to offer bigger pay rises, to cope with a shortage in workers from the EU. Reuters has the details: The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said its monthly survey showed starting salaries rose in October at the second-quickest rate since November 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd REC chief executive Kevin Green said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd British workers really do need a pay rise. As these chart shows, real wages have been shrinking since the spring as inflation has rattled up to 3% - mainly due to the slump in the pound after the EU referendum. UK firms seem to be particularly reluctant to commit to new offices and factories. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agents found that firms expect to invest less in 2019 and 2020, as they await more clarity about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic future and how Brexit will play out. The agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report says: Firms in the survey expected investment growth to be little changed over the next twelve months, relative to the past twelve months. However, investment growth was expected to be somewhat weaker over the following two years. Expectations for investment growth in the coming twelve months were strongest for business services contacts, and were weakest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at broadly unchanged levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for construction. This chart confirms that firms expect to spend less: This report is based on interviews with 375 businesses, who employ 578,000 people in the UK. Breaking: UK companies are struggling to recruit new staff, and expect to hand over larger pay rises next year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents, just released. The agents found that : Recruitment difficulties had intensified and were above normal in a range of activities, alongside continued modest employment growth. As a result, pay growth had edged up and was expected to be somewhat higher in 2018 than this year. Firms suggested that pay settlements next year could be clustered around 2\u00c2\u00bd%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3\u00c2\u00bd% rather than 2%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3% during 2017. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, then Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze could end next year. The latest figures show that basic pay is only rising by 2.1%, while inflation has hit 3%. The agents also found that firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of investment growth in the following two years were weaker than last month. Many blamed economic uncertainty, due to Brexit and concerns about the future availability of overseas labour. The report says: Investment plans were being boosted by companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 desire to increase their efficiency and to meet expected increases in demand, but expectations about the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationships were dragging on spending. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agents also reported that growth in activity remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Manufacturing output growth had risen again, with export supply chains supported by the past fall in sterling and some signs of increased domestic sourcing. But construction output growth had eased. Services turnover growth remained moderate. Anne-Sylvaine Chassany, the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris bureau chief, reports that Bank of America is pressing on with its plans to move 300 staff from London: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Big Six could soon be the Big Five. No, not in the football (before any long-suffering Arsenal fans cry foul), but in the energy market. SSE and Npower have now agreed terms to merge their household supply businesses in Britain, creating a new supplier with over 11 million customers, more than anyone else. The deal, which was reported yesterday, is likely to stir worries about competition and could yet be blocked by regulators. SSE is the second largest supplier, while nPower is joint-4th largest. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Market says the deal will face \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intense competition scrutiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Especially after the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent pledge to control price increases for the most vulnerable to fix what many regard as a broken market, where prices continue to rise despite a move towards renewables. Big six to big five doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly scream \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer benefit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Marks &amp; Spencer also reports that its food sales -- usually so buoyant - dropped by 0.1% in the last six months. Rising food inflation took a bite out of profitability too, leaving M&amp;S hoping that its new Christmas advert starring Paddington Bear is a hit. Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown sees little to celebrate: The food business has been keeping M&amp;S afloat in recent years, but now progress seems to be flagging here, the clothing division needs to start pulling its own weight. The festive period also looks set to be challenging for the high street. Real wages are around 0.5% lower than they were last year, and the recent interest rate rise might well make consumers think twice about loading up on debt to fund the annual Christmas splurge. For M&amp;S it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days in the turnaround plan, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfortunate that the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structural issues have been compounded by tough times in the industry as a whole. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any champagne accompanying the marmalade sandwiches at M&amp;S HQ, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick brew, then back to work.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in the City, shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have dropped by more than 2% after it announced it is speeding up its turnaround plan. Chief executive Steve Rowe warned that M&amp;S still faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many structural issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The firms now plans to open fewer new Simply Food outlets, and accelerate the closure of other stores. CFO Helen Weir is also moving on. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Brexit continues to loom over the City of London, as the clock ticks towards 31 March 2019 when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. The Financial Times reports that major banks warned the US commerce secretary last week that they will soon start shifting jobs out of London, unless there is more clarity. The Wall Street titans, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, reportedly cited Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unstable government and the lack of progress in planning Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Collectively they employ tens of thousands of people in the City. Crucially, they warned Wilbur Ross that they are approaching the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153point of no return\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- where they have to trigger their Hard Brexit contingency plans and begin shifting jobs, capital and infrastructure overseas. As the FT puts it: Those briefed on the talks, which were held over lunch at Wilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exclusive St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s district, said the banks were particularly concerned by the failure of Britain to provide clarity over whether it will secure a transition deal to smooth the changing regulatory regime after the UK leaves the EU. They warned they had even less clarity over what a final Brexit deal will look like. Absent clarity from the government about post-Brexit plans, the executives said jobs would move back to the US or to other European capitals as banks begin to enact their worst-case contingency plans, the sources said. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThere was broad discussion around the lack of progress in the Brexit talks and some discussion around various political scenarios,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one person briefed on the talks said. UK business chiefs have also been urging Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to nail a transition deal by the end of this year. So, with Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major players getting nervous, the pressure is growing.... China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures landed shortly before Donald Trump touched down in Beijing for a state visit. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the president will want to know that China posted a trade surplus of $26.6bn with the US in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5bn less than in September, but 12% higher than in October 2016. It means that China has racked up a trade surplus with the US of $223 billion so far this year, on track to match 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total, despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises to trim it. US and Chinese companies are expected to sign several commercial deals during Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit (these agreements are typically lined up to give politicians some good news to share). The South China Posts says Beijing has four key goals: Persuade Washington to lift export restrictions on hi-tech products, so US firms could sell more to China Create more cooperation between the US and China in research and development in fields such as space and aviation Boost US participation in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Belt and Road Initiative - a massive economic expansion drive - and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Press the US to tone down its probe into alleged Chinese IP violation Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. New trade figures from China have missed expectations, which may be a sign that global growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as punchy as we hoped. Chinese export growth slowed to 6.9% in October, below expectations of 7.2% growth, and down on September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust 8.1%. Import growth also slower, rising by 17.2% last month after a blistering 18.7% in September. The figures could signal that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, after a solid year, is flagging a little this autumn -- as Beijing cracks down on pollution and tries to shift from manufacturing to services. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big picture is that both outbound and inbound shipments have softened recently, a trend that continued last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We suspect that this reflects a slight easing of growth in other emerging markets along with weaker domestic demand as a result of slower infrastructure spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mubina Kapasi, analyst at ET Now, points out that China imported less iron ore than usual, and also shipped out less steel. Given China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key role in the world economy, these trade figures may weigh on European stock markets today. David Madden of CMC Markets says: China is making a concerted effort to move towards a more service focused economy. That being said, their demand for minerals is still a major driver of commodity prices and mining companies.

Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers.

Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:49:26.018Z\">at 1.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059ce5c0cdb10716cc11a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:37:02.225Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model.</strong></p> <p>She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too.</p> <p>Brown explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProbably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities.

David Madden of CMC Markets says: European equity markets are in the red today as traders feel uneasy about being long going into the weekend in light on the sharp correction yesterday. The rapid move lower yesterday got traders thinking about how much markets have come in recent months, and that prompted some profit taking. And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Some late news before the weekend; US consumers have become a little gloomier. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly gauge of morale fell to 97.8 in October, a big fall from September. Time for a quick recap. Uber drivers are celebrating after the company failed to overturn a ruling that they are actually workers, not self-employed contractors. Lawyers say it is a landmark ruling, that means Uber faces liabilities for national minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. However, the taxi app company could appeal again. Kevin Charles, consulting barrister at Crossland Employment Solicitors, argues that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gig economy faces a major shake-up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where previously they had been treated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-employed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and denied access to any employment rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century: Sam Dumitriu, the ASI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Projects, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news from the UK, including... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a rise in exports to the EU. Manufacturing output has jumped, as firms benefit from the weaker pound and global economic growth But construction output shrank sharply as firms refuse to commit to new offices and factories UK GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months, a little faster than before Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth rate rose to 0.5% in the last three months, according to a new report. NIESR, the think tank, estimates that the UK growth rate picked up last month. That pushed growth in the August-October period up to 0.5%, they believe, from 0.4% in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2017, suggesting the economy is recovering from its early slowdown. Amit Kara, Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, says: Although economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. NIESR also predict that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 2% by 2021 My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take: The ride-hailing firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed. The landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision. Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed. Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central London, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal flexibility they value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Independent Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights. Aslam said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farrar said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers. Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply declare that workers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if the evidence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back it up. He explains: Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model. She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too. Brown explains: With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProbably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed. If they are workers though, they may be exposed to a significant NIC liability. There may also be a substantial VAT liability.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Frank Field MP, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge success for workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He adds: [Labour MP] Rachel Reeves and I will next week be proposing to our select committees a draft bill which would make these individual, but important, skirmishes a thing of the past as legislation would protect all workers in similar situations.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Oxford law professor Jeremias Prassl is tweeting the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling: UK law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which represented Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drivers, are understandably delighted to have won today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling. They argue that it is a critical moment in ending exploitation of workers in the gig economy. Paul Jennings, partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite, sums up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are delighted with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgment which is ethically and legally the right outcome. The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We anticipate that tens of thousands drivers will now seek to make substantial back-dated claims. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uber could continue its battle, by appealing to the court of appeal or even the supreme court. Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde &amp; Co, warns that this will mean more uncertainty for UK companies and workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The final outcome of this case will provide employers with much needed clarity in this area. But uncertainty is likely to linger until the supreme court has and possibly beyond that, if the government commits to legislative changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cloud of uncertainty looming over the gig economy has undoubtedly made new businesses in the UK cautious about building a business model around a self-employed ad-hoc workforce, which may be further stagnating growth and therefore damaging the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is particularly concerning as the Brexit clock keeps on ticking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK needs to ensure it is demonstrating that it is open for business and at the very least showing business that there is legal clarity around alternative employment practices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jamie Jenkins, barrister at St John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Buildings, predicts that Uber will appeal again. Ruth Kennedy, barrister at 2 Temple Gardens, tweets: Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst, believes Judge Eady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has massive consequences for other companies, as well as Uber. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implications of this appeal decision reach far beyond the price of a taxi journey home. Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model for its workforce has again been found to be fatally flawed; the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drivers are in fact workers entitled to basic rights such as holiday and sick pay. This decision has re-opened a can of worms which will have a ripple effect on the financial viability of the gig economy in its current form and beyond that into mainstream industries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unions are urging Uber to accept today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153throw in the towel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, rather than continuing its fight. TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady said: No company, however big or well connected, is above the law. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This ruling should put gig economy employers on notice. Unions will expose nasty schemes that try and cheat workers out of the minimum wage and holiday pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sham self-employment exploits people and scams the taxman. The Uber drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union GMB deserve huge credit for their work on this case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can read the full ruling in the Uber case, here. In it, her honour Judge Eady QC explains that the Employment Tribunal was correct to conclude that an Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on, was within London, and willing and able to accept assignments was working for Uber London Ltd (ULL) under a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contract. As she puts it: If the reality is that Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share in London is such that its drivers are, in practical terms, unable to hold themselves out as available to any other PHV operator, then, as a matter of fact, they are working at ULL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disposal as part of the pool of drivers it requires to be available within the territory at any one time. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling confirms that Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drivers in the UK are entitled to various workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another victory for the two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who argued successfully that they and fellow drivers were effectively employees. The ruling has significant ramifications for the gig economy, and firms whose business model is based on flexible working patterns. Legal firm Leigh Day say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a landmark ruling. Newsflash: Uber has lost its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are actually workers. An employment tribunal in London has backed the original ruling, last year, that Uber drivers are not self-employed. More to follow.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry, though, had a bad September. Construction output slumped by 1.6% during the month, the biggest fall since March 2016. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures indicate the shadow of Brexit still looms large over the industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum causing imported building materials costs to rise, while company and UK investors caution is holding back investment in new projects, so many contractors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 margins are shrinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commercial and industrial sectors that rely on ambitious multi-million pound construction projects are the hardest hit, and only new builds in the private house sector, propped up by the likes of Help to Buy loans, are offering any glimmer of hope at the moment. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, points out that the construction sector is now in recession: Yael Selfin, chief economist at HSBC UK, reckons UK exporters should be doing better... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may finally be benefitting from stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound, says James Smith of ING. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged by the jump in manufacturing growth in September, saying: One of the big \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stories of 2017 is the global pick-up in growth. That, along with the weaker pound, has seen UK manufacturing sentiment rise noticeably. But for much of this year, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it by looking at the production numbers. But a sharp 0.7% month-on-month rise in production during September, following some better readings over the summer, suggests these positive drivers may finally be being reflected in higher output Capital Economics have stripped out oil and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 factors from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK trade figures to show how the underlying picture is improving. Despite September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent figures, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total trade deficit actually widened over the last quarter to \u00c2\u00a39.5bn. More good news! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories were running full steam ahead in September. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% over the month, easily beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. A stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance benefited the broader measure of industrial production, which also beat forecasts with a 0.7% increase according to the ONS data. The figures mean that the production sectors - which include mining and utilities as well as manufacturing - made a stronger contribution to the economy in the third quarter than previously thought, growing by 1.1% between July and September. A rise in factory activity over the three months was largely driven by the production of cars and medical equipment, the ONS said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official explanation of how Britain grew its exports to the EU in the last quarter: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00c2\u00a31.7 billion (3.8%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. As shown in Figure 2, this was due to decreases in exports of fuels (\u00c2\u00a31.6 billion) and chemicals (\u00c2\u00a31.0 billion), which offset increases in exports to non-EU countries of other commodities over the same period. Exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00c2\u00a30.9 billion (2.2%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. The main contributor was increases in exports of transport equipment (predominately cars), which increased by \u00c2\u00a30.7 billion. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has narrowed by \u00c2\u00a3700m, partly due to a rise in exports to European countries. The gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to \u00c2\u00a32.75bn in September, a better result than expected. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has been revised lower, too, to \u00c2\u00a33.45bn. The Office for National Statistics says the improvement is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 primarily due to increased exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The trade in goods deficit is also better than expected, coming in at \u00c2\u00a311.2bn. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dire figure has been upgraded to \u00c2\u00a312.3bn, not the \u00c2\u00a314.25bn initially reported. The report also shows that the UK exported \u00c2\u00a3900m more goods to European countries in the three months to September, but sold \u00c2\u00a31.7bn LESS to non-EU countries. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries increased, by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn and \u00c2\u00a31.5bn respectively over the last quarter. The ONS says: The increase in imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and fuels from non-EU countries represents the largest increase in import commodities, alongside increases of mechanical and electrical machinery, material manufactures and fuel imports from EU countries. German business leaders have weighed in on the tricky issue of Brexit, warning that time is running out to agree a comprehensive deal between the two sides. Reuters has the details: The European Union and Britain will not be able to reach a comprehensive deal on their future economic relations by the March 29, 2019, exit deadline, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest industry group BDI warned on Friday, adding that a hard Brexit was very likely. The two sides will need many years to complete a comprehensive deal on trade and investments, BDI managing director Joachim Lang told Reuters. The comments come ahead of showdown talks between prime minister Theresa May and business leaders from the UK and Europe, on Monday. UK and EU negotiators are due to wrap up the latest round of talks in Brussels later today. The latest rumour is that Northern Ireland could remain inside the European customs union and single market after Brexit. This would avoid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hard border on the island of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, reports the Financial Times. It offers the intriguing prospect that City banks could move operations to Belfast rather than, say, Frankfurt to retain passporting rights in the EU.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dank, grotty morning in the City of London, as traders await today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures. The FTSE 100 is bobbing around the 7485 mark, up one meagre point. The French CAC and German DAX are equally subdued, as the markets slope towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is hoping that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data will provide some intrigue. The FTSE has struggled in the last couple of days, with a volatile commodity sector and a flagging set of retail stocks dragging the UK index back below 7500. As for the pound, while its seen some progress in recovering last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Bank of England losses, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still nowhere near its pre-hike highs. Against the dollar sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wrong side of $1.315, while against the euro the currency is straining to keep its ahead above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see whether the latest manufacturing and industrial production figures can make anything better a bit later. The former is forecast to fall from 0.4% to 0.3% month-on-month, while the latter is expected to nudge higher, from 0.2% to 0.3%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the goods trade balance reading, with analysts estimating the deficit to have shrunk from \u00c2\u00a314.2bn in August to \u00c2\u00a312.9bn in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deficit problem -- the gap between what Britain buys from the rest of the world, and what it sells back. New trade figures due out today may show that the UK managed to narrow this gap, a little. Economists predict that the trade deficit dropped to around \u00c2\u00a34.5bn in September, from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointingly large \u00c2\u00a35.6bn. That would be a welcome sign, but frankly the broad picture is that Britain is still struggling to rebalance its economy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been no sign, yet, that the weak pound is boosting exports. In August, the trade in goods deficit expanded to an alarming \u00c2\u00a314.2bn -- dwarfing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus in service. This goods deficit is expected to drop to \u00c2\u00a312.8bn in September - still a yawning gap in historical terms. In a flurry of data, the Office for National Statistics will also publish new UK industrial production figure. UK manufacturing output is expected to have grown by 0.3% in September, down from 0.4% in August. Then at lunchtime the National Institute of Economic and Social Research will estimate how fast the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew between August and October. We know that the UK grew by 0.4% in July to September, so these figures will show if growth slowed last month. Also coming up today... World stock markets seem a little edgy today after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Some traders blame uncertainty over US tax \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans, amid complaints that the richest Americans will benefit the most. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: President Donald Trump and corporate America may not be satisfied with the revised Senate Republican tax plan. The dollar and global equities received a hit on news that Republican senators are likely to delay the introduction of corporate tax cuts until 2019. The reaction in markets wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise, given that investors have been pricing in a lot of good news and further pullback may continue for a couple of days or weeks, as many stocks look overbought at the moment. The Senate wants to maintain the seven tax brackets, rather than the four proposed by the house. They also want to tax foreign profits held by offshore U.S. companies at a different rate. However, the timing of the corporate tax cuts will likely determine how markets move for the remainder of 2017. Meanwhile in London, Uber will discover whether its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are employees has been successful. And finally (as they say on the TV news), John Lewis are launching their Christmas advert, starring a large and cuddly creature named Moz who lives under the bed. A damning indictment of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing crisis, no doubt, but can he match the success of Monty the Penguin?....

His decision came because of uncertainty around the relationship between pay and unemployment, which is an important guide to domestic inflationary pressures. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the serial disappointments we have had in recent years in forecasting the impact of unemployment on pay growth, there is, in my view, a not immaterial risk that the trade-off is not as it currently appears and that domestic inflation pressure will undershoot the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation.</p> <p>In my view, the low level of domestic pressure on inflation now, the absence of second round effects from the depreciation of sterling, and inflation expectations around their historical averages, make it possible to wait before tightening policy until there is clear evidence that pay growth is responding to the level of unemployment in line with our forecast.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that the apparent disappearance of the link between pay and unemployment was one of the key puzzles of the post recovery economy in the UK and in advanced economies. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some of the relationships between economic variables that we depended on in the past appear to have gone on a longish leave of absence, but we are not sure why, or whether this is a temporary or more persistent departure.</p> <p>Against that background \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and although it makes forward-looking monetary policy more difficult \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I tend to put more weight on the evidence we can or cannot see in the data, and a little less on the un-observables and on how we think the economy works.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also emphasised that his decision did not anticipate any particular Brexit outcome:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We can, in my view, only work on what we see in the economy now, and stand ready to respond as necessary as Brexit emerges. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13209de705b0179386e46b0df8d7af262ecc4968\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13209de705b0179386e46b0df8d7af262ecc4968/0_46_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Jon Cunliffe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Jon Cunliffe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-14T17:35:18.304Z\">at 5.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a0b26d602d23606ce8c907e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-14T17:24:43.882Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/930486032231030784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Heads Up!

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The euro seemed to be the only real winner this Tuesday, with the currency managing a robust rise as seemingly everything else fell.</p> <p>The Dow Jones joined in with the wider decline after the bell. The US index dropped nearly 150 points, hitting a fortnightly low as it struggles to keep its head above 23300 due to doubts about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan.</p> <p>One of the main drivers of UK trading this Tuesday was the commodity sector. Brent Crude fell 1.1% on increased output in the US, while copper plunged 2% as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing production slipped from 6.6% to a worse than forecast 6.2% month-on-month. This all sparked a 2.5%-3% dive from the likes of Rio Tinto, Anglo American and BHP Billiton, with BP also falling 0.7%, preventing the FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is down 0.2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from enjoying sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp decline against the euro. </p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to say the Eurozone indices are not best pleased with the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent comeback. The currency is looking pretty buff this Tuesday, surging 0.7% against the pound and 0.8% against the dollar thanks to a mixture of strong GDP and ZEW economic sentiment readings, and the various issues plaguing its rivals. This meant that the DAX shed another 80 points, leaving the German bourse at a fresh near 3 week nadir. The CAC, meanwhile, lost 0.6%, with the Spanish IBEX dropping under 10000 following a 0.8% decline. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0b05ccbe620206ef71bf75\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/angela-monaghan\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-14T15:37:08.954Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK households unable to save for emergencies, MPs told</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Falling real pay, higher housing costs, and cuts to benefits are limiting the ability of UK households to save money for emergencies and retirement, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have been told.<br><br>In the first session of the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiry into household finances, Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said family budgets were being constrained as wages in real terms are \u00c2\u00a315 a week lower than they were before the financial crisis.<br><br>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In those circumstances - and housing costs have gone up quite a lot during that phase - then obviously people are finding it hard to save,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bell said.<br><br>He added that many low to middle income families say that while they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to save \u00c2\u00a310 or more a month, they cannot afford to do so.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-14T16:42:26.387Z\">at 4.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a0affed22c4a1070a15d40e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-14T14:42:56.004Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are heading lower in early trading, on continuing concerns about the Republican tax plans.

                "bodyText":"A stronger euro following positive eurozone growth figures helped undermine European markets, while Wall Street fell back on concerns about the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plans and the prospect of rising interest rates. In the UK, the FTSE 100 outperformed other major indices, despite a fall in mining companies as commodity prices lost ground on weak Chinese data. The UK index was helped by positive performances from Vodafone following its results and Tesco after its takeover of Booker was cleared by competition authorities. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.01% at 7414.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.31% to 13,033.48 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.49% lower at 5315.58 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.63% to 22,297.08 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.59% at 9990.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.38% to 720.18 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 72 points or 0.3% lower. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. When the Bank of England raised interest rates earlier this month, two members of its monetary policy committee voted to keep them on hold. In a speech to the Oxford Economics Society one of them, Sir Jon Cunliffe, has been explaining his reasoning. His decision came because of uncertainty around the relationship between pay and unemployment, which is an important guide to domestic inflationary pressures. He said: Given the uncertainties \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the serial disappointments we have had in recent years in forecasting the impact of unemployment on pay growth, there is, in my view, a not immaterial risk that the trade-off is not as it currently appears and that domestic inflation pressure will undershoot the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation. In my view, the low level of domestic pressure on inflation now, the absence of second round effects from the depreciation of sterling, and inflation expectations around their historical averages, make it possible to wait before tightening policy until there is clear evidence that pay growth is responding to the level of unemployment in line with our forecast. He said that the apparent disappearance of the link between pay and unemployment was one of the key puzzles of the post recovery economy in the UK and in advanced economies. He said: Some of the relationships between economic variables that we depended on in the past appear to have gone on a longish leave of absence, but we are not sure why, or whether this is a temporary or more persistent departure. Against that background \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and although it makes forward-looking monetary policy more difficult \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I tend to put more weight on the evidence we can or cannot see in the data, and a little less on the un-observables and on how we think the economy works. He also emphasised that his decision did not anticipate any particular Brexit outcome: We can, in my view, only work on what we see in the economy now, and stand ready to respond as necessary as Brexit emerges. Gocompare.com, the price comparison website spun out of esure a year ago has rejected a takeover bid from property group ZPG, owner of Zoopla. ZPG offered 110p a share, valuing Gocompare at nearly \u00c2\u00a3420m, but its target said the offer fundamentally undervalued its business. Gocompare shares jumped nearly 10% to 102p on the news, while ZPG added 0.4% to 338p. Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has taken many by surprise with an announcement that his government will distribute \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.4bn worth of welfare handworks to citizens worst hit by cuts in the coming weeks. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Attempting to repeat his politically adroit gesture of handing out pre-Christmas \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgifts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last year, the leftist leader said the Greek economy had done so well his government had decided to distribute \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 1.4bn from the primary surplus it had posted in 2017. In a televised address that took many by surprise, Tsipras said the government had decided to more than double the amount it would distribute in the form of a one-off \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in December. Among those entitled to the handout would be citizens worst hit by austerity, including low-income pensioners and unemployed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are in the very pleasant position of being better prepared and more organised to offer an even bigger amount \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to the people who need it most,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Because the debt-stricken country had beaten fiscal bailout targets mandated by international creditors keeping it afloat, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac720m of the primary surplus would go towards buttressing households earning less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18,000 annually, the equivalent of around 3.4 million people, he said. Another \u00e2\u201a\u00ac360m would be given to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public power corporation to protect poorer consumers from tariff increases while \u00e2\u201a\u00ac315m would alleviate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd health insurance payments previously incurred by pensioners. The leftist-led coalition is hoping to make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean exit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from international supervision when its third EU-IMF funded bailout officially expires next summer. But critics today were quick to accuse Tsipras of dangerous populism with the main opposition New Democracy party saying the measures were the price of over-taxation that had otherwise killed the economy and as such were tantamount to taking from Peter to give to Paul. Stock markets are under pressure at the moment, with worries about the Trump tax plans, a stronger euro and declines in commodities combining to send shares lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The euro seemed to be the only real winner this Tuesday, with the currency managing a robust rise as seemingly everything else fell. The Dow Jones joined in with the wider decline after the bell. The US index dropped nearly 150 points, hitting a fortnightly low as it struggles to keep its head above 23300 due to doubts about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan. One of the main drivers of UK trading this Tuesday was the commodity sector. Brent Crude fell 1.1% on increased output in the US, while copper plunged 2% as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing production slipped from 6.6% to a worse than forecast 6.2% month-on-month. This all sparked a 2.5%-3% dive from the likes of Rio Tinto, Anglo American and BHP Billiton, with BP also falling 0.7%, preventing the FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is down 0.2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from enjoying sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp decline against the euro. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to say the Eurozone indices are not best pleased with the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent comeback. The currency is looking pretty buff this Tuesday, surging 0.7% against the pound and 0.8% against the dollar thanks to a mixture of strong GDP and ZEW economic sentiment readings, and the various issues plaguing its rivals. This meant that the DAX shed another 80 points, leaving the German bourse at a fresh near 3 week nadir. The CAC, meanwhile, lost 0.6%, with the Spanish IBEX dropping under 10000 following a 0.8% decline. Falling real pay, higher housing costs, and cuts to benefits are limiting the ability of UK households to save money for emergencies and retirement, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have been told. In the first session of the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiry into household finances, Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said family budgets were being constrained as wages in real terms are \u00c2\u00a315 a week lower than they were before the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In those circumstances - and housing costs have gone up quite a lot during that phase - then obviously people are finding it hard to save,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bell said. He added that many low to middle income families say that while they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to save \u00c2\u00a310 or more a month, they cannot afford to do so. US markets are heading lower in early trading, on continuing concerns about the Republican tax plans. Investors are also worried that further interest rate rises - with another expected next month - could harm the economic recovery. Weaker than expected Chinese data overnight also added to the downbeat mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down52 points or 0.22% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened 0.35% lower. The pound remains weaker against both the dollar and euro. The stronger than expected US producer prices figures are supporting the US currency, with the pound now down 0.05% at $1.3108. Against the euro, sterling has slipped 0.8% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1151 following positive economic news from the eurozone, including 2.5% GDP year on year growth in the three months to September. Over in the US, and producer prices climbed by more than expected in October. The month on month figure rose by 0.4%, the same figure as in September but higher than the forecast 0.1%. On a yearly basis, prices were up 2.8% compared to expectations of a 2.4% rise and a 2.6% increase in September. The figures add more weight to the idea of another rate rise by the Federal Reserve in December. UK house prices continued to climb in September, according to separate figures released by the ONS. Prices increased by 5.4% in the year to September 2017, up from 4.8% in the year to August. The ONS said the annual growth rate had slowed since the middle of 2016 but remained around 5% during 2017. But there are further signs of cooling in London, which showed the lowest annual growth rate in the country at 2.5%. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club, said housing market activity was being hit by weaker consumer purchasing power and wariness over making major transactions. He said: We see house prices being muted over the fourth quarter and then rising a modest 2%-3% in 2018. The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging over the coming months with consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power continuing to be squeezed by inflation running higher than earnings growth. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. It is also very possible that the recent Bank of England interest rate hike will weigh down on housing market activity. While the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels - with the impact further limited by the fact that the share of mortgages on variable rates has fallen to around 40% from a peak of 70% in 2001 - the fact that it was the first rise in interest rates since 2007 could have a significant effect on housing market psychology by focusing minds on the likelihood that households will have to deal with higher mortgage rates over the coming months and years. Having said that, the Bank of England again stressed that interest rates will rise only gradually and to a limited extent. Time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remains at its highest level since 2012, putting more pressure on people hit by the real wage squeeze. The consumer prices index rose by 3% in October, matching September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading. Although over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, it is a little less than economists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Bank of England itself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had forecast. Food prices are playing a key role driving CPI up, with food price inflation hitting 4.1%. Inflation is hitting poorer families hardest, says the Resolution Foundation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the cost of essential items is pushing higher. Some economists are predicting that inflation may now be peaking. That would bring some relief to families. But until wages rise faster, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze will continue. Unions are pushing the government to relax the public sector pay cap, to help teachers, nurses et al recover from years of austerity. UNISON general secretary Dave Prentis says workers are under financial pressure: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to take action in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, ensure the pay cap is lifted and give public service employees a decent wage rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures: Over in Frankfurt, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor has spoken about Brexit.... The jump in food price inflation to 4.1% may drive more families to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing roster of food banks. Garry Lemon of the Trussell Trust, a charity which runs food bank, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already an issue: Several City economists are predicting that inflation may now have peaked, having stuck at 3% last month. The theory is that the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit-induced tumble will fade out of the annual inflation figures before much longer. And with the economy weak, it will be hard for retailers to hike prices. However, food prices may still keep rising over the next few months. Stephen Oldfield, Agri-Food leader at PwC, fears that prices may accelerate before Christmas, making the festive season a little less jolly. Oldfield says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This food cost inflation has yet to fully come through to prices on the shelves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the recent inflation figures for the UK were 3%, with food a main contributor. But that still doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully reflect the costs rises, so we expect food prices to continue to rise during the final quarter of 2017. One of the reasons for this is the time lag, as costs rise in terms of feeding through the food chain from importers to suppliers to supermarkets themselves. And Stuart Law, CEO of peer-to-peer lender Assetz Capital, reckons savers still face meagre returns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that inflation has peaked at 3%, but will fall very slowly over the next year or two. This will provide little comfort to those losing money every day on their savings where the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate of interest is less than inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent base rate rise will have also driven up borrowing costs, whilst not passing much on to savers so, with inflation perhaps falling slowly now from 3%, this rise may have been implemented prematurely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With wages rising at little more than 2%, and inflation at 3%, Christmas will be a squeeze for many families. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for coping with the cost of living: check you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a fixed rate energy tariff (one that guarantees the price you pay per unit) and if not switch shop around for food and fuel so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying any more than you need to check whether you could cut your mortgage repayments by switching to a fixed rate deal if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SVR Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephen Clarke on how inflation is hurting poorer households: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the headline rates of inflation remained unchanged, the drivers of inflation have continued to shift \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and are hitting less well-off families particularly hard. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Food and drink prices increased faster than at any point in the last four years, while clothing prices also rose at a rate above overall inflation. The rising cost of these basic items affects low and middle income households far more than better-off households, who are also being cushioned by static fuel costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With prices rising far quicker than wages, it is vital that the Chancellor keeps in mind the double whammy of squeezed pay packets and frozen benefits when he announces his Budget next week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation has interrogated today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, and shown that poorer households are suffering particularly badly from the surge in inflation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because essential items, such as food, are rising sharply in price. Higher energy bills also hit families across the board. In contrast, the cost of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnon-essentials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as hotels and restaurants was more subdued last month. Plus, the recent drop in petrol prices is welcome if you own a car, but not if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford one... A Treasury spokesperson says the government is trying to fight the cost of living squeeze: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand that people are concerned about increases in everyday costs. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have cut taxes and introduced the National Living Wage, which has lifted the wages of the lowest paid by over 6% above inflation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also why we are bringing in an energy cap to help people with the cost of household bills.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The jump in food and drink prices are a particularly blow for the poorest in society (as everyone has to eat). So even if inflation peaks soon, the cost of living squeeze could continue for a while. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With monthly inflation gradually moderating, households will be relieved that the UK may have now reached the peak in year-on-year price rises. However, the overall figures mask significant increases in the price of basic necessities such as fruit and vegetables, which are most likely to hit those already struggling to cope with the squeeze on real incomes due to the high inflation. Labour MP Chuka Umunna says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ongoing Brexit chaos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is hitting people in their pockets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only is inflation continuing to run well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, at 3%, but the inflation rate for food and drink has increased to 4.1%, the highest since September 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are feeling the Brexit squeeze as real wages contract and everyday items become more and more expensive. Nobody voted in the referendum to make themselves poorer, so people have every right to look at the impact Brexit is having on their finances and ask themselves whether the realities of Brexit match up with what they were promised. If not, everyone has the right to change their mind. On one level, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading is a relief to the Bank of England. The BoE is responsible for maintaining price stability. So governor Mark Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to write a letter explaining why CPI has deviated more than 1 percentage point away from the 2% target. But.... the Bank expected inflation to push over 3% this autumn, when it raised interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% two weeks ago. If inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as strong as feared, has the Bank blundered by hiking borrowing costs, at a time when consumers are cautious and economic growth is slow? Inflation is measured across a number of areas. And this chart neatly shows how transport (yellow) and food (blue) have driven inflation higher this year. In 2016, they both pulled the cost of living down (as you can see, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve below zero), but this year they have both become significant contributors. Alistair Wilson, Head of Retail Platform Strategy at Zurich, sees some light at the end of the living squeeze tunnel: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Higher inflation is creating a living standards headache for families as prices continue to rise faster than their pay packets. However, there are signs that the worst of the squeeze on family finances may be coming to an end with British workers set for the biggest pay rises since before the financial crisis, likely to increase by between 2.5% and 3.5% next year. At 3%, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate is outstripping pay rises - -which only rose by 2.1% over the last year. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government needs to take action -- and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget is the perfect opportunity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must stop turning a blind eye to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis. Household budgets are being stretched to breaking point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages will continue to lag behind inflation unless the Chancellor acts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget is a chance to give five million public sector workers the pay rise they are long overdue. And its a chance to invest in the kind of high-skilled jobs people can live on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Housing and household service costs made the biggest contribution to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to electricity price rises, and increases in council tax over the last couple of years. Food was another key factor (as explained earlier), along with transport costs (even though fuel prices have dipped recently) The jump in inflation over recent months is clearly a blow to UK consumers, even though October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as feared. Thomas Wells, manager of the Smith &amp; Williamson Global Inflation-Linked Bond Fund, says households are still suffering the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK inflation remains elevated, in line with our expectations. We continue to view the post-referendum weakness in sterling as the key driver of the recent spike in inflation, putting pressure on household budgets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is unquestionably bad for consumers, especially when combined with the recent increase in interest rates pushing up mortgage repayments. We therefore expect conditions to remain tough, putting downward pressure on demand, and hence inflation, over the next six months. The cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages rocketed by 4.1% over the last 12 months -- helping to keep overall inflation high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how UK inflation is running at a five-year high this autumn: Rising food prices kept Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate at 3% last month. The Office for National Statistics reports that food prices jumped across \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all main classes of product\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including dairy products, which have seen recent wholesale shortages ONS Head of Inflation Mike Prestwood says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation remains at a five year high with rising food prices offset by a fall in the cost of fuel.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in the cost of raw materials and goods leaving factories both slowed, with crude oil and petroleum prices both increasing less than at this time last year. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has stuck at 3.0% in October, matching September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-year high. That means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no let-up in the cost of living squeeze hitting UK households. On the upside, City economists had feared the consumer prices index would have risen even higher, to 3.1%. More to follow! Here we go.... Italians didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much to cheer about during last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football. But this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data is a whole new ball game! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.5% in the third quarter of this year, ahead of expectations for a 0.4% rise. That matches France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, and is slightly faster than the UK. After several sluggish years, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy does seem to have shifted up a gear in the last few quarters: The Netherlands economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with forecasts: Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some useful charts ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK inflation data, due in 30 minutes: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German growth figures: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic heart is pumping away and a 0.8% Q3 q/q GDP gain in Germany threatens to nudge the Eurozone growth rate up too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the changing of the guard as the US economic cycle ages. Tesco executives might be reaching for a bottle of Finest fizz later; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been given a provisional green light to buy cash-and-carry group Booker. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition authorities have concluded that the deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean higher prices or a poorer service for shoppers. Tesco shares have jumped by 5% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, as investors wager that the Booker deal will help its turnaround plan. Over in the City, ITV has reported that TV ad revenue fell 7% in the first nine months of the year. The broadcaster expects improvement with a fall of 5% for the full year, as brands roll out big budget festive campaigns in the run up to Christmas. October will be down 1%, November up 2% and December up 1%. Peter Bazalgette, ITV chairman, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd grocers and consumer brands (like P&amp;G and Unilever) are returning to TV advertising but the economy is still very uncertain. The euro has hit a three-week high, on the back of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth. The single currency has risen 0.3% to $1.17, its highest rate since 26th October (when the ECB decided to extend its stimulus programme into 2018) In another boost, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the first three months of 2017 has been revised up to 0.9%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures show that Germany remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the high-flyer of the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, say Carsten Brzeski of ING. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressed that German GDP grew by 0.8% in the last quarter, writing: Never tired of good news? Then have a look at the latest German GDP data. The economy continues its golden cycle and staged yet another strong growth performance in the third quarter..... Growth was driven by public consumption, investment and net exports. Only the construction sector took a longer vacation break. Even if the economy would stagnate in the final quarter of the year, GDP growth for the entire year would still come in at 2.4%; the highest reading since 2011. Boom! Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has beaten expectations by growing twice as fast as the UK in the last quarter. German GDP expanded by 0.8% in July to September quarter, thanks to strong trade and investment figures. That beats expectations for 0.6% growth, and means Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is having a very impressive year. In contrast, the UK grew by 0.4% in the third quarter, while France expanded by 0.5%. As Destatis, the German statistics office, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153German economic growth continues at a high rate. Exporters put in another strong performance, meaning Germany shipped more to the rest of the world than it bought in. Destatis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exports were stronger than imports in the third quarter. As a result, net exports had a positive impact on the GDP compared to the previous quarter. Investment in new machinery and equipment also rose, while government and consumer spending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained rather stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze may hit a new five-year high today, as the weak pound continues to drive up prices in the shops. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index is expected to hit 3.1%, up from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% and the highest level since March 2012. Economists say that rising food and energy prices will push inflation up. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness - still down over 10% since the EU referendum in June 2016 - is another factor. This would bring more pain for households, as wage increases are running at just over 2%. It would also force Bank of England governor Mark Carney to write a letter of explanation to the UK chancellor, explaining why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed to keep inflation close to the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Also coming up today... New growth figures are expected to confirm that the eurozone economy grew by a punchy 0.6% in the third quarter of 2017. We also get individual figures from Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four top central bankers are appearing at a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt. Mark Carney will join Janet Yellen of the Federal Reserve, ECB chief Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan will all discuss \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Communications challenges for policy effectiveness, accountability and reputation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better; while it held flat against the pound, largely due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation and wage growth issues, it shed 0.1% against the euro and 0.4% against the yen.</p> <p>Things were just as glum in Europe. The FTSE is down around 50 points thanks to its commodity stocks, and is trading at its worst price since the end of September, while the DAX, displeased at the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience, has shed nearly 120 points to hit a fresh 6 and a half week low. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c5983be620206ef71cb66\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/juliakollewe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T15:19:23.030Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK used car sales fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the UK, and sales of used cars fell over the summer, according to the industry body.

Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears.</p> <p>What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month.</p> <p>With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to rate movements.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year.</p> <p>Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago.</p> <p>This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018.</p> <p>There was some equally good news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter.</p> <p>All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c522402d23606ce8c99d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T14:53:50.088Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales rise, as consumer prices edge up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter</p> <p>An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials.

In September, the consumer price index had climbed 0.5%.</p> <p>The data - the inflation figures in particular - was seen as negative for the dollar. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest gain witnessed in three months.</p> <p>Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar.</p> <p>Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively.

                "bodyText":"Continuing strength in the euro, a falling oil price and a decline in US markets, have combined to pull most European shares lower. On Wall Street, worries about a Chinese slowdown and concerns over the Republicans successfully implementing their tax plans were additional negative factors. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 41.81 points or 0.56% at a five week low of 7372.61 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.44% to 12,976.37 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.27% at 5301.25 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.62% to 22,158.88 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bucked the trend, up 0.24% at 10,013.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.19% to 718.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 87 points or 0.38%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Markets may be lower but could be supported at these levels. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: Stocks are falling, volatility is on the up, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth appears to be weakening and we even have a military coup to deal with. On the face of it, the situation would be ripe for a big selloff in equity markets, but this is not 2008 or even 2015. Below the surface some sectors, such as utilities, are recovering, while in the UK and Europe markets are off their lows. It is options expiration week, and a look at positioning through put/call ratios suggests sentiment has become excessively bearish. Plus, Thanksgiving is on the horizon, and the week before this all-American holiday tends to be a good one. The bears can almost taste victory, but I suspect that 2017 will work its magic once again and the dip buyers will have their way. The concerns about a rise in US crude stocks last week proved well founded. They climbed by 1.85m barrels compared to earlier forecasts of a 2.2m drop. Gasoline stocks rose by 894,000 barrels as opposed to the expected 0.9m decline. Oil prices remained in the doldrums after report but at least recovered from their lows, with West Texas Intermediate now doen 0.46% at $55.24 a barrel. US markets remain in negative territory although the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down 131 points or 0.5%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets looked pretty bloody this Wednesday, with the euro once again the only real winner. With US investors already fretting about the Republican tax reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push them through after they failed so spectacularly on healthcare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a weak pair of inflation and retail sales readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do much to help matters. The former came in as expected at a measly 0.1% in October, down from 0.5% in September, while the latter arrived at a better than forecast, but still miserly, 0.2%. Neither figure substantially threatens a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve; however, the tendrils of doubt are never too far away, meaning the US markets could have done with something more robust to drive away the current gloom. Instead the Dow Jones is stuck with a 130 point fall, taking the index to a sub-23300, near 4-week nadir. The dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better; while it held flat against the pound, largely due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation and wage growth issues, it shed 0.1% against the euro and 0.4% against the yen. Things were just as glum in Europe. The FTSE is down around 50 points thanks to its commodity stocks, and is trading at its worst price since the end of September, while the DAX, displeased at the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience, has shed nearly 120 points to hit a fresh 6 and a half week low. Back in the UK, and sales of used cars fell over the summer, according to the industry body. Julia Kollewe writes: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said today that the used car market declined for a second quarter, with sales down 2.1% between July and September from a year ago. About 2.1m secondhand cars changed hands. Superminis are still popular, making up a third of sales. Along with SUVs they were the only categories to show growth. Silver remains the most popular used car colour, closely followed by black. Sales of hybrid and electric cars rose 17% to 25,196 units (electric cars alone urged 66.4%). While petrol sales fell 6.5%, demand for diesels rose 4.2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in stark contrast to new diesels where sales have fallen sharply. After a bumper first quarter the market remains at record levels, with more than 6.3m buyers opting for a used car in the first nine months of this year, up 0.1% on the same period last year. Simon Benson, director of motoring services at used car website AA Cars, said:\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales of used cars have suffered - but not nearly at the same rate as the new car market, which experienced a double digit decline last month. A lack of consumer confidence has rippled out across the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retail sales and inflation figures are likely to add more fuel to the fire in terms of a US rate rise next month, analysts believe. But there is some uncertainty as to the future trend of borrowing costs, especially with a new Fed chair for the new year and a change in the composition of the decision making panel. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears. What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month. With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to rate movements. ING economist James Smith said: A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year. Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago. This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018. There was some equally good news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter. All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year. Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials. Economists had forecast no change. Meanwhile the September figure was revised upwards from 1.6% to 1.9%. On the inflation front, consumer prices edged up 0.1% in October as a boost to oil prices from the hurricane-related disruptions to the Gulf Coast fell away. In September, the consumer price index had climbed 0.5%. The data - the inflation figures in particular - was seen as negative for the dollar. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest gain witnessed in three months. Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar. Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively. A solid breakout back above 94.50 threatens the current bearish setup. US markets are on the slide again, hit by a falling oil price and continuing worries about the ability of the Republicans to achieve their proposed tax cuts. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.9% at $55.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency issued a gloomy outlook on the prospects for global demand for oil. Later come the latest US crude inventory figures, with investors worried they might show an increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 155 points or 0.66% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.58%. Back in London, a Bank of England deputy governor has insisted that wages should rise in 2018 as low unemployment forces bosses to pay more for labour. Obviously there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much sign of this happening yet, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lacklustre wage growth. But Ben Broadbent insists that reports of the death of the Phillips Curve (the classic inverse relationship between unemployment and pay) were exaggerated. Broadbent told an audience in London that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Several commentators have questioned the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central prediction that wage growth will rise next year. Some have gone further and pronounced the death of the Phillips curve. There are always risks to any forecast. But the latter claim, at least, is premature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadbent also blamed the tumble in the pound after the EU referendum for pushing down real wages, as the weak currency made imports pricier and thus pushed inflation up. Breaking away from UK unemployment briefly, there are three important developments in Greece. First, the Greek government has launched a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn debt swap, asking investors to hand over existing bonds in return for new debt. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to ease Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 return to the financial markets after years of bailouts. These new bonds won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mature for many years, sparing Greece any nervy repayment deadlines. But secondly, ratings agency DBRS has warned that Greece is unlikely to make much progress in its current bailout talks this year. Thirdly, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftist-led government has taken further steps to relax capital controls that were imposed to stop its banks collapsing during the crisis two years ago. Helena Smith reports from Athens The Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative of impending exit from seemingly perpetual crisis took a knock today as the Toronto-based rating agency said it was unlikely that Athens would complete crucial bailout talks before the end of the year. In a note the ratings service reckoned a compliance review with international auditors representing creditors keeping Greece afloat would not be completed until 2018. Wrapping up the review was key to unlocking debt relief talks and discussions on the type of support Greece would receive once its current bailout programme ended in August next year Meanwhile, the leftist-led coalition took another step Wednesday towards easing capital controls imposed to prevent a run on banks at the height of the debt crisis. A degree that went into effect today, foresees depositors being able to fully withdraw sums in bank accounts transferred from overseas as of December 1st. People who have not previously held bank accounts will also be able to open one under the new regulations signed by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and published in the government gazette. Despite what the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted (see earlier) UK unemployment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually a record low. The current jobless rate of just 4.3% is the lowest since 1975; in early 1974 it was just 3.6%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless total of 1.42 million also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a record - it was lower in 2004 and 2005. Thanks to economics professor Danny Blanchflower for flagging this up. In another significant development, The Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust has warned an extra 42,000 young people dropped out of the labour market and the education sector in the last three months. This group became economically inactive, and were not in education or training either - a worrying sign. Joe Levenson, communications and campaigns director at the Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust, says the jump highlights the challenge facing young adults - particularly mothers with young children. Levenson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u015342,000 more young people are now economically inactive and out of education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a dramatic increase on the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women in particular are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by a lack of convenient childcare and support. While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, 343,000 young women who are not included in the numbers are being left jobless and forgotten. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the same time, we have a youth debt epidemic, which is only set to worsen as prices rise and wages remain low. It can be especially hard for young mums; in many cases, an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s childcare can cost more than an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Much more needs to be done to improve young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available, and extended the National Living Wage to under-25s, so they are paid the same amount for the same work. This will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how the number of young adults who have left the labour force has risen, while those in work or looking for work has dropped: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has just welcomed the drop in unemployment and the rise in productivity seen today. (I suspect this tweet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come directly from the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thumbs; it would be very disrespectful to tweet during Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions - as Hammond is sat next to Theresa May on the front bench) The number of people from other EU countries working in Britain has hit a record high, up by 112,000 in the last year. That takes the total number of EU nationals to 2.38m. There are also 28.55m UK nationals in work (up 183,000 in the last year), and 1.21 million non-EU workers (down by 23,000). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key chart: My colleague Alan Travis has examined the data, and writes: The figures from the Office of National Statistics show that the number of Polish and other east European nationals working in Britain has dropped for the first time in more than 10 years, down from 1,054,000 in the summer of 2016 to 1,035,000. The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has, however, continued to rise, from from 257,000 to 347,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 90,000 increase that accounts for the majority of the overall increase in the last year. More here: With wages lagging inflation, struggling families may be forced to hit their credit cards hard this Christmas. Positive Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director Fran Boait hopes that Philip Hammond can help next week - especially as the Bank of England has raised the cost of borrowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As real pay continues to fall, households are being forced to borrow ever-greater amounts to make ends meet. The economy is being kept afloat on the back of families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit cards, at increasingly high interest rates. In the budget later this month, the Chancellor must act to boost investment and deliver a sustainable boost to incomes, before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a rates rise - now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a pay rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Resolution Foundation, the UK think tank, fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market is losing momentum. They are concerned by the drop in employment over the summer, as it could show the labour market is plateauing. The persistent failure of wages to rise when workers have been in shorter supply is another worry. They say: The biggest pay squeeze is taking place in other service sectors (-2.7%), public administration (-2.2%) and real estate (-1.9%), while pay growth is strongest in agriculture (+3.9%) and in support services (+0.8%). Stephen Clarke, Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic analyst, expects real wages to keep falling for the next few months. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After years of impressive growth, there are signs that the labour market may be losing momentum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The still strong picture on employment still refuses to have any meaningful impact on wage growth, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay squeeze is getting deeper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome productivity figures offer a glimmer of hope on pay, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to say whether it can grow into a meaningful recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Resolution have also produced some charts to explain the pay squeeze: Amid the real wage gloom, there is an encouraging sign..... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to have become more productive. The ONS estimates that productivity per hour grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first increase since the end of 2016, and is the highest rate of growth since Quarter 2 2011. This could be a crucial factor in getting wages up -- as bosses have been blaming weak productivity for the meagre pay increases doled out to their staff. David Willett, Corporate Director at The Open University, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcencouraging development\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For too long the UK has been lagging behind, with a lack of higher skills limiting the agility and adaptability needed to drive organisations forward. Stagnant productivity is a significant barrier to growth at an uncertain time when we need to ensure the stability of our economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Organisations now need to keep this up. With technology advancing at a rapid rate, and businesses looking to automate where they can, low-skilled jobs are increasingly under threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial that organisations invest in training their staff to build up essential technical and soft skills to future-proof them against changes in the political, economic and technological environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for everyone in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister for employment, Damian Hinds, has hailed the drop in UK unemployment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strength of the economy is driving an increase in full-time, permanent jobs and a near-record number of people are now in work thanks to the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When unemployment fell to 5% early last year, many people thought it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much lower, and yet it now stands at 4.3%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut income tax for 30 million people since 2010, meaning people keep more of their money each month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the labour market looks quite different if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the opposition front bench. Debbie Abrahams MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, points out that the cost of living squeeze hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stats are further evidence of Tory economic failure, only a week out from their next Budget. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over seven million people live in poverty in working households. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour will introduce a \u00c2\u00a310 an hour real Living Wage, scrap the public sector pay cap and reform the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failing Universal Credit programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain is now suffering its second wage squeeze since the financial crisis, as this chart from the FT shows: How can unemployment and employment both have fallen, I hear you cry. The answer is that the number of adults classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomically inactive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has gone up. That means more people have simply dropped out of the labour market altogether. Geraint Johnes, Research Director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour market statistics show unemployment continuing to fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by some 59000 between the second and third quarters of this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.3%. The most recent fall, however, is due largely to a large increase in the number of people deemed economically inactive. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key chart, showing how the number of economically inactive people in Britain rose by 151,000 in the last quarter. That will include students, people stopping work to care for a family member, or look after young children, or just giving up the search for a job altogether. Professor Johnes has also spotted that more people are only working part-time: Meanwhile, part-time employment has risen, with an increase of 18000 part-time employees and 45000 part-time self-employed. Inasmuch as it continues a trend towards greater casualisation and insecurity in the labour market, this should be noted as a cause for concern. Overall the level of employment has fallen. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing wage squeeze is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge body blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to consumers as they try to make ends meet in the run-up to Christmas, says Maike Currie of Fidelity International She fears that real wage growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elusive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for some time: With a number of factors keeping a lid on our earnings - from people working flat out in the gig economy yet still struggling with paltry pay, more and more people in self-employment, falling unionisation, automation and technology substituting man for machine, this is unlikely to change any time soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nick Macpherson, formerly the top civil servant at the Treasury, fears that the UK labour market is cooling.... Here are some charts showing the state of the UK labour market: This chart from the Office for National Statistics shows how wage growth has struggled to get much above 2% this year. And that means that real wages are falling, whether or not you include bonuses: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in nominal terms (that is, not adjusted for price inflation) increased by 2.2% both including and excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.5% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. The pound has risen slightly, as City traders welcome the pick-up in wage growth in the last quarter. Breaking! The number of people in employment across the UK has fallen, for the first time in nearly a year. There were 32.06 million people in work in July-September, which is a 14,000 drop on the previous quarter. This is the first drop since August-October 2016, and the biggest decline since April-June 2015. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 75.0%, down slightly compared with April to June 2017 but up from 74.4% for a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at a 42-year low of just 4.3%. Unemployment fell by 59,000 between July and September to 1.42 million, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 182,000 less than a year earlier. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages squeeze continued to bite in the last quarter, according to the latest Labour Market report just released. Basic pay rose by just 2.2% per year in July-September, meaning that wages continued to lag inflation. Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.2%. In contrast, inflation was 2.7% in August, rising to 3% in September and October. More to follow... Britain has rediscovered its taste for Angel Delight! Sales of the retro desert are up 30%, in a boost for Premier Foods. Angel Delight first hit the shelves in the late 60s, when UK cuisine was more basic.... Overnight, Japan has posted its seventh consecutive quarter of growth, the longest run in over a decade. Japanese GDP rose by 0.3% during the July-September, with rising exports making up for weaker domestic demand. This will be welcomed by Tokyo as it tries to put Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost decades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind it, and achieve steady growth and inflation. But it also means Japan will be one of the slower-growing G7 nations in the third quarter; Germany grew by 0.8%, America by 0.75%, France and Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by 0.4%. All eyes on Canada.... On a nominal basis (not discounting for inflation), Japanese growth was 0.6%. This chart, from manufacturing group EEF, shows how UK wages have fallen below inflation (the dotted line) this year: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report will paint a picture of an economy suffering from subdued wage growth, but enjoying record low unemployment. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the pound could suffer if the wage figures are particularly bad. He writes: Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is at a 42-year low, the buzzkill remains, that little sign of rising pay growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. If average earnings struggle to pick up, consumers are likely to continue feeling the squeeze, especially when considering how inflation remains at a five-and-a-half year high, at 3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real wage squeeze is set to deepen today, when we get new data showing how the UK labour market is performing. Economists predict that basic pay (excluding bonuses) grew by around 2.2% per annum in the July-September quarter, up from 2.1% a month ago. Any increase would be welcome, but this would still leave wages lagging behind inflation - which ran at a five-year high of 3% in September and October. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada warn that UK wages will remain subdued for several months, but might then rise faster. With the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Regional Agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey indicating pay settlements could pick up next year to 2.5-3.5% next year, it could well be some way into 2018 before there is sufficient evidence from the labour market reports that pay growth is making a meaningful advance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report may also show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate stuck at just 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. In theory, such a tight labour market ought to drive wages higher as bosses compete to recruit workers. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: With unemployment at 42 year lows of 4.3%, it surely can only be a matter of time before wage pressure starts to manifest itself further..... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already started to see increasing evidence that wages at the lower end of the income scale are rising at rates faster than inflation as the effects of increases in the minimum and living wage help pull up wages at the bottom of the pay scales. This should inevitably see a trickle up effect as earners higher up the income scale start to demand higher wages in a tightening labour market,. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning ahead of the jobs report, which is released at 9.30am.

However, its lending to landlords plummeted by 40% to \u00c2\u00a31.7bn. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/11/nationwide-caution-lending-brexit-economy\">Nationwide sounds note of caution over lending in run-up to Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Half-year profits at Nationwide fell to \u00c2\u00a3588m from \u00c2\u00a3615m, although the society said this was partly because of extraordinary items, and that underlying profitability was ahead. It said that future full-year profits will be in a lower range than previously thought, at \u00c2\u00a3900m-\u00c2\u00a31.3bn a year, partly because of the poorer outlook for the mortgage market and partly because as a mutual it wants to return gains to customers. </p> <p>The chief executive, Joe Garner, said that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sluggish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economy, partly a result of Brexit, weak wage growth and rising prices are straining its customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, the UK economy should continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate due to the uncertainties around Brexit. Despite the recent base rate rise, borrowing costs overall remain low. However, we know that low wage growth and inflation are putting pressure on household budgets and we remain alert to signs of financial strains on consumers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Garner. </p> <p>Loan impairments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where customers have fallen behind with repayments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were up from \u00c2\u00a337m to \u00c2\u00a359m, but remain a tiny proportion of the society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total assets of \u00c2\u00a3228bn. </p> <p>The society was ordered by banking regulators four years ago to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/20/uk-banks-capital-shortfall-pra\">plug a capital shortfall</a>, but Garner said its capital position is now at an all-time high and significantly above other high street lenders. </p> <p>Once just a savings and loans provider, the society has emerged as one of the strongest players in current account banking. Garner said that over the past two years it has added 19% more current account customers, taking the total to 7.1m, and that it had taken more account switchers than the major banks combined. </p> <p>However, the society admitted that pricing pressures in mortgages and loans are intensely competitive, and that its market share is likely to decline over the next six months. </p> <p>The half-year results reveal just how dependent the society is on the London property market, although it said its exposure was in line with other lenders.

Total mortgage lending slipped from \u00c2\u00a317.5bn to \u00c2\u00a316.7bn, largely because of a steep decline in loans for buy-to-let following the tax changes. But as lending for landlords has fallen, loans granted to first-time buyers have surged. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest building society said it accounted for one in five of all mortgages given to first-time buyers, helping a record 39,500 young buyers on to the property ladder. However, its lending to landlords plummeted by 40% to \u00c2\u00a31.7bn. Half-year profits at Nationwide fell to \u00c2\u00a3588m from \u00c2\u00a3615m, although the society said this was partly because of extraordinary items, and that underlying profitability was ahead. It said that future full-year profits will be in a lower range than previously thought, at \u00c2\u00a3900m-\u00c2\u00a31.3bn a year, partly because of the poorer outlook for the mortgage market and partly because as a mutual it wants to return gains to customers. The chief executive, Joe Garner, said that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sluggish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economy, partly a result of Brexit, weak wage growth and rising prices are straining its customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, the UK economy should continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate due to the uncertainties around Brexit. Despite the recent base rate rise, borrowing costs overall remain low. However, we know that low wage growth and inflation are putting pressure on household budgets and we remain alert to signs of financial strains on consumers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Garner. Loan impairments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where customers have fallen behind with repayments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were up from \u00c2\u00a337m to \u00c2\u00a359m, but remain a tiny proportion of the society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total assets of \u00c2\u00a3228bn. The society was ordered by banking regulators four years ago to plug a capital shortfall, but Garner said its capital position is now at an all-time high and significantly above other high street lenders. Once just a savings and loans provider, the society has emerged as one of the strongest players in current account banking. Garner said that over the past two years it has added 19% more current account customers, taking the total to 7.1m, and that it had taken more account switchers than the major banks combined. However, the society admitted that pricing pressures in mortgages and loans are intensely competitive, and that its market share is likely to decline over the next six months. The half-year results reveal just how dependent the society is on the London property market, although it said its exposure was in line with other lenders. It has lent nearly \u00c2\u00a360bn to homeowners in the capital, compared to just \u00c2\u00a316bn in the whole of Scotland and Wales, and \u00c2\u00a322bn in the rest of the south east of England. Nationwide said house price growth had moderated to the 2% to 4% band in recent months, and that it expected the market to mirror the economy, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sluggish in the near term [but] our central expectation is that it will accelerate in the years ahead, once Brexit uncertainties recede\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"A downbeat end to the week for equities saw declines in most major markets. Worries about the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects of getting their tax cut proposals left Wall Street lagging, while some downbeat results and broker downgrades undermined European shares. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.26 points or 0.08% at 7380.68 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.41% to 12,993.73 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.32% lower at 5319.17 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.51% to 22,092.95 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.78% at 10,010.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.58% to 712.46 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 82.9 points or 0.35%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Carillion is one of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers following another profit warning. Jill Treanor writes: Carillion, one of the construction companies working on the HS2 London to Birmingham rail line, is racing to refinance its business after issuing its third profit warning in five months and suffering a collapse in share price. Shares in the company, which is at the heart of several major building projects in the UK, were suspended eight times on Friday after the shock update to the City that it would breach the terms on its existing lending at the end of the year. The shares crashed 60% when the stock market opened on Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to their lowest ever levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and were still down nearly 40% near the end of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. At this price, about 25p, the shares are barely a tenth of the 240p level seen at the start of 2017 and values the company at just \u00c2\u00a3120m. Carillion has debts of \u00c2\u00a31.6bn and analysts expect the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known for its work on expanding the main stand at Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anfield football ground and its ongoing development of Battersea power station \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to have to ask its lenders to swap their debt for shares. The company employs 30,000, two-thirds of them in the UK, and has contracts with the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Ministry of Defence. It is building hospitals including Merseyside\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Liverpool and also has a support services operation which has maintenance contracts for buildings. The government, one of its major customers, said it was being kept informed. The full story is here: Meanwhile over in Athens thousands of Greeks chanting anti-austerity and anti-capitalist slogans are marching through the city centre to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against military rule, writes Helena Smith. Greek riot police, bracing for possible violence, are out in force. Communist party members, holding red flags aloft, are leading the protest and using it to decry the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbarbaric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policies enforced on workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brussels you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to disentangle yourself from the left\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is among the chants currently wafting over the capital. Anti-US slogans are also rife with demonstrators deploring the agreements the leftist led government recently signed with Washington during official White House talks between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and US president Donald Trump. Global markets are shrugging their way towards the end of the week, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The Dow Jones dipped 50-ish points after the bell, keeping the right side of 23400 as investors (very lightly) fretted over the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to get their tax plan through Congress. The dollar, meanwhile, could only ease, rather than eradicate, the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, with the greenback down 0.1% against the pound, 0.2% against the euro and 0.5% against the yen as investors process the news that Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign officials back in October. Over in the Eurozone the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains continued to cause a headache for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices. The DAX slipped 0.1%, the CAC 0.4% and the IBEX 0.8%, cementing a rather miserable week for the trio. As for the FTSE, despite a relatively flaccid performance by the pound, and the reversal of early losses in the commodity sector, the UK index just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything going this Friday. Instead it sat flat around 7390, preventing from taking off thanks, in part, to United Utilities and Severn Trent. The UK water sector was hit by a downgrade on United Utilities from HSBC analysts, who cut their recommendation from buy to hold. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $8000 after reports that a software upgrade which could split the cryptocurrency in two was going ahead. The price had fallen last week on suggestions the upgrade would be suspended. The move would mean owners of Bitcoin would in theory also hold the new spin-off, and sell it at a profit. Bitcoin has risen more than 700% this year and is on track for its best week since July. David Cheetham, chief market analyst, at XTB said: Major fundamental concerns remain as to the efficacy of Bitcoin but for now price remains in a strong uptrend and many observers experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) are looking at any drops as buying opportunities. After showing good gains on Thursday, US markets are on the slide again. With the latest results season coming to a close and no major economic data due, investors are focused on political issues, especially concerns about the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to get their tax reforms through Congress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 66 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.14% lower. But the Nasdaq Composite has bucked the trend, opening broadly flat. One standout performer is retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. After more than a year of declines, it reported strong quarterly sales growth of 4% and forecast postive sales for the forthcoming holiday period. Its results were boosted by a strong performance from its surfwear brand Hollister. The company, which failed to sell its business in July, saw its shares jump 20% following the latest figures. Shares in Carillion have fallen from about 240p at the beginning of this year to 28p today: US homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as communities hit by hurricanes started to replace homes damaged by flooding. Housing starts jumped by 13.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million homes, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since October 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller number, at 1.18 million homes. The increase in starts ended three consecutive monthly declines. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently up 1.2% or 72 cents at $62.05 a barrel. But it is still on course for the first weekly loss in six, as Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to cut production fuels concerns of oversupply. Prices are expected to end the week 2% to 3% lower than the end of last week. Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said the rise today shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be overplayed. After five days of continuous losses, an upside correction is always on the cards. Such a jump, however, will not mean a change of heart. Over in Greece, EU auditors have given a mixed verdict on the handling of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three bailouts. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The three financial lifelines thrown Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015 achieved their overarching goal of averting default but were far from successful in other respects, EU auditors have concluded. Issuing their first in-depth look into the cash- for-reform programmes, the independent Luxembourg-based court of auditors said Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued inability to finance itself on international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains a challenge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Design and implementation of economic policies was poorly judged, the watchdog claimed, with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic depression being much deeper than ever envisaged as a result of tough fiscal measures. It added: The [EU] commission did not comprehensively consider Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implementation capacity in the design process and thus did not adapt the scope and timing accordingly. More than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac350bn has been poured into Greece by the EU and IMF to keep the country afloat. The Greek government, which is preparing to exit the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn rescue programme in August 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is desperately trying to rally spirits ahead of that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c did not comment on the report. It is far from sure if Greece will require further aid when its current programme officially expires. The FTSE 100 has reversed its earlier losses and is now up 15 points, partly because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier gains have largely been erased. The FTSE tends to do better when the pound is weaker, because so many of the companies listed have significant overseas earnings. Here are the current scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,402 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 13,065 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 5,345 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 22,158 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,058 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 384 The pound has lost some of its earlier sparkle and is now trading roughly flat against the dollar at $1.3197. It has also slipped agains the euro, down 0.2% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1186. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains the gravity of the situation facing Carillion and its shareholders: Shares in Carillion have collapsed yet again as the troubled construction company stated it will breach its banking covenants. The company also lowered its profit outlook again and stated that their asset sale programme isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going as fast as they had hoped. Things have gone from bad to worse at Carillion, and the business is in dire need to cash to keep the lights on. Even though the business has plenty of work in the pipeline, it must scramble for cash in order to keep its head above water. The UK government is one of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest clients and is monitoring the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles. Reuters quotes a spokeswoman at the Cabinet Office: The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carillion horror show continues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is how Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, describes the latest developments at the construction firm. He adds: Some sort of recapitalisation was inevitable, but a possible debt for equity swap, with debt even higher than the group had anticipated, is probably as bad as anyone would have guessed. The group has made some progress on asset sales, and it sounds like some cost savings are being made. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what the group expected though, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly not enough. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also probably irrelevant given the state of the balance sheet, with net debt already many multiples of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation. Carillion shares plunged as much as 60% in early trading after the construction group involved in HS2 and Battersea Power Station issued its third profit warning of the year: The group now expects that a combination of delays to certain PPP disposals, a slippage in the commencement date of a significant project in the Middle East and lower than expected margin improvements across a small number of UK Support Services contracts, partially offset by cost savings initiatives realised in the fourth quarter, will lead to profits for the year to 31 December 2017 being materially lower than current market expectations. Shares are now down 37% at 26p. The company, which is struggling to cope with a large debt pile and badly-performing contracts, said the board expects a covenant breach at the end of December and will need to implement a recapitalisation plan. Keith Cochrane, interim chief executive, said: Whilst we continue to target cash collections, reduce costs, execute disposals and focus on delivering for our customers, it is clear that significant challenges remain and more needs to be done to reduce net debt and rebuild the balance sheet. Constructive dialogue is continuing with our financial stakeholders, and I am grateful for their support. I remain focused on addressing this issue before my successor, Andrew Davies, takes up the role on 2 April 2018. Love it or hate it, Black Friday is almost upon us. In recent years Britain has embraced the American tradition where retailers slash prices the day after Thanksgiving. British shoppers are expected to spend \u00c2\u00a310.1bn in the week of Black Friday, which falls on 24 November this year. Just in case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested, here is a piece we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done on some of the best deals going this year: News of Greggs controversial decision to replace the baby Jesus with a sausage roll in an advent calendar has rippled across the Atlantic: Draghi concludes by returning to one of his favourite themes, saying eurozone governments should do their bit to secure future economic stability by getting their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiscal houses in order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB will do our bit, you do yours, is the message: ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate is framed in terms of price stability, as this is the best contribution that we can make to the welfare of citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the economy to be able to grow along a balanced path that can be sustained in the long run. This is the guiding principle of all our monetary policy decisions. With the recovery ongoing, now is the right moment for the euro area to address further challenges to stability. This means actively putting our fiscal houses in order and building up buffers for the future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just waiting for growth to gradually reduce debt. It means implementing structural reforms that will allow our economies to converge and grow at higher speeds over the long term. And it means addressing the remaining gaps in the institutional architecture of our monetary union. The full text of Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is available on the ECB website: Here comes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the ECB president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. Mario Draghi says that despite solid growth and rising employment, inflation is not at the point where it will pick up without stimulus from the central bank. (Eurozone inflation dipped to 1.4% in October from 1.5% in September.) He says the recovery thus far has been highly dependent on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support. The key quote: We are not yet at a point where the recovery of inflation can be self-sustained without our accommodative policy. A key motor of the recovery remains the very favourable financing conditions facing firms and households, which are in turn heavily contingent on our policy measures. An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term. The ECB announced last month that it would slow its bond-buying programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month starting from January. However, it extended the support for at least another nine months to the end of September 2018, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi says. The key message here is that ECB policy is likely will remain supportive for some time to come. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Draghi is running through stats to illustrate how much the employment picture has improved in the eurozone. He says it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a remarkable success story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that unemployment has come down in the single currency-bloc at the same time that participation in the labour market is rising, as more women and older people enter the workforce. Consumption is being supported by a virtuous circle between rising labour income and rising employment. Employment in the euro area has reached its highest level ever, while unemployment has fallen to its lowest rate since January 2009. Importantly, this has taken place against the backdrop of a rising participation rate, which is now 2 percentage points above its pre-crisis level. This has been driven in particular by the increased entry of women into the workforce, whose participation rate has risen by 4 percentage points since 2008 and reached an all-time high. It has also been strongly driven by older people. Since the start of the crisis, the participation rate has increased by 3.6 percentage points for people aged 50-54, 13.6 percentage points for 55-59 year olds and 17.1 percentage points for 60-64 year olds. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is speaking in Frankfurt at the European Banking Congress. He begins on a positive note on the outlook for the eurozone economy: The euro area is in the midst of a solid economic expansion. GDP has risen for 18 straight quarters, with the latest data and surveys pointing to unabated growth momentum in the period ahead. From the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective, we have increasing confidence that the recovery is robust and that this momentum will continue going forward. The FTSE is suffering from the stronger pound this morning, Spread Ex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell says: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4% against the greenback, with the dollar losing its House tax plan-passing buzz, as Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen Trump campaign officials. Against the euro, meanwhile, sterling nudged 0.2% higher, keeping above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. This meant the FTSE continued to founder around the 7380 mark, dipping 0.2% as it struggles to escape its 6-week lows. As has been the case all week, commodities are doing their part, with a smattering of red among the oil and mining stocks helping suppress appetite in the UK index. The FTSE 100 is down 17 points this morning, and the biggest faller among its major European peers: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,370 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.2% at 13,074 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.02% at 5,335 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.01 at 22,204 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,074 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.02% at 385 Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, has been interviewed by the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, Larry Elliott, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth a watch if you missed it: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has a spring in its step this morning, hitting a two-week high against the dollar of $1.3252. Sterling is benefitting from a sharp sell-off of the dollar triggered by reports in the US that special counsel Robert Mueller served President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election campaign a subpoena in mid-October, requesting documents relating to Russia. As CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson explains, positive sentiment earlier in the day (generated by the passing of a bill in the House of Representatives aimed at cutting US company rates from 35% to 20%), quickly evaporated: The passing of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill helped the US dollar close near its intraday peaks yesterday, while also helping push up US yields with the 2 year yield hitting its highest level since October 2008. These US dollar gains were pretty short-lived and soon gave way to selling on reports that Trump officials had been subpoenaed by special attorney Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian involvement in the Trump Presidential campaign. This sent the US dollar sharply lower against the yen, dragging on the Nikkei as well as pushing the euro above 1.1800 and the pound to a two week high above 1.3200.

The case was brought in May by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to force the firm to accept the collective bargaining rights of its members. But in its ruling, the Central Arbitration Committee, which oversees collective bargaining law, concluded that Deliveroo couriers are self-employed because they have a right to ask a substitute to perform a job for them. By law, anyone with the right to do this is classed as self-employed, and self-employed workers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entitled to collective bargaining rights.</p> <p>Critics claim Deliveroo manipulated the system to duck its liabilities.

The law needs to change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The charges for essential kit were added to the contract at the same time. Again, Deliveroo insists this was to benefit its couriers who can now use non-branded items, allowing them to work for other companies between jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They only buy what they need, so if they already have protective clothing, lights and helmet, they only have to buy the backpack and thermal bag,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage the workforce</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Benfield, Deliveroo rider</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The union has described the treatment, as evidenced by Shaughnessy, as callous and disrespectful. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage their workforce,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jim Benfield, a Deliveroo rider and secretary of the Courier and Logistics branch of the IWGB.</p> <p>Shaughnessy claims that riders are often unable to earn their dues because regular app outages prevent them from signing on for assigned shifts; the driver support team is frequently uncontactable; and payments are often miscalculated in Deliveroo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have been times when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked four shifts in a week doing over 20 deliveries and received the pay equivalent for less than one shift,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says.

We want employment law to be updated to allow us to offer riders benefits such as sick and injury pay, without limiting the flexibility they value.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The need for new legislation is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to a parliamentary review, which concluded that profit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not flexibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the motive for using a self-employed workforce. The 21st-century phenomenon of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gig economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has, critics claim, undone a century of progress and reintroduced sweatshop conditions. The IWGB had hoped that a tribunal ruling forcing Deliveroo to recognise union membership, would haul it into the new millennium. Last week that hope proved a forlorn one. But experts reckon the CAC ruling should not affect the latest legal challenge for fair pay. They can take heart from Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent defeat in a similar case brought by its drivers. FOR AND AGAINST SHORT-TERM WORK The so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gig economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a sector which relies on short-term contracts or freelancers. Instead of a regular salary, those who work in it get paid per job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or gig. Classed as independent contractors, they are not entitled to the national minimum wage or sickness, holiday or redundancy pay, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have guaranteed working hours. Supporters claim it allows people to choose their own working patterns, while businesses are spared statutory staff overheads. An estimated five million people work this way, and the Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts that in 2020-21 it will cost \u00c2\u00a33.5bn in lost taxes. A government-sponsored review has recommended that firms with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153controlling and supervisory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relationship with workers, such as Uber and Deliveroo, should have to pay a full range of benefits, including national insurance contributions. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

That is the preliminary verdict from International Monetary Fund staff who have just completed an official visit to Australia.

The IMF verdict came the same day as Jonathan Kearns, the Reserve Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of financial stability, noted in a speech on Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market that house prices in Australia had risen by two-thirds since 2009, with growth of housing credit outpacing incomes. He said Australians need not worry about negative impacts from foreigners buying residential property, because purchases by foreign buyers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not, on the whole, reduce the supply of dwellings available to local residents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, [they] may actually contribute to expansion of the housing stock,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The IMF has noted that the Turnbull government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to return the budget to surplus by 2020-21 was predicated on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapid rebound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of nominal GDP in the next few years. Deloitte Access Economics warned earlier this month that budget plan was unrealistic, because it was built on the assumption that 44% of the estimated increase in national income over the next four years would be collected in federal taxes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a record-high share. The Deloitte report followed a separate report from the Parliamentary Budget Office last month that found the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to return the budget to surplus was heavily reliant on personal tax increases across every income bracket, with the largest tax increase to hit middle-income earners. It said the tax hikes reflected a seismic shift in the taxation burden from businesses to individuals. The personal tax increases are necessary to compensate for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial $65.4bn company tax cuts. The IMF has supported the Turnbull government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for greater corporate and personal income tax cuts, as part of a larger plan for tax reform. It said Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state governments should abolish their stamp duty tax regimes and replace them with broad-based land taxes, such as the new land tax regime in the Australian Capital Territory. It said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd corporate tax cuts in other large advanced economies could encourage similar tax cuts here, because they would have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capital flow implications of potential concern for Australia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The ACT was actually the strongest housing market, with new dwelling construction contributing 1% points worth of growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the next biggest in NSW: It means the NSW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy now takes up a bigger share of the national economy than it has for over a decade, and WA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy takes up a smaller share than it has since 2008-09: But one thing all the states have in common is falling real household disposable incomes. Reflecting the national picture observed in the latest GDP figures, real household disposable income fell in every state and territory in 2016-17 except for the ACT \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which saw a big boost coming from property income. Western Australia still remains the richest state per capita, but its household disposable income per capita fell 2.8% in current dollars and whopping 3.5% in real terms. So big was the fall that it was the only state to actually see a fall by more than the national average: The state economy figures are good for giving the full picture of what is going on across the country. It shows that while NSW and Victoria are leading the way and driving national growth, Western Australia has fallen into a very deep recession, with the fall in business investment so large that not even its massive surge in exports is enough to overcome it. But while economic growth varies across the country, one thing households in all states are experiencing is declining incomes. As we move into the new year, with employment growing well but wages growth largely dormant, it will remain be the biggest economic puzzle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how to get income growth re-started. And as we get closer to the next election, it is a puzzle that the government hopes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and possibly needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to solve.",

This was little short of calamitous.</p> \n<p>For the past 100 years and more the UK has gradually got a bit better at doing things. New machines have been introduced. Workers have become more skilled. More has been produced with less effort and as a result living standards have risen steadily.</p> \n<p>Until the financial crisis, this improvement in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-productivity-puzzle-blame-low-pay\">productivity</a> averaged 2% a year, with periods of stronger growth in the 1950s and 1960s balancing out the bad times, such as the 1920s and early 1930s.</p> \n<p>The OBR, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent forecasting body, says this long-term trend has been broken. Britain can no longer expect productivity growth of around 2% a year; instead it will have to make do with around 1% a year. Before the financial crisis, the UK was at or near the top of the G7 league table; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/uk-comes-bottom-of-the-g7-growth-league-as-canada-takes-the-lead\">now it is at the bottom</a>.

                "bodyText":"The 1956 Suez crisis was the moment Britain had to wake up to the fact that it was no longer the force it once was. The November 2017 budget was its economic equivalent. Forget the extra money to paper over the cracks in the NHS. Leave to one side the willingness to throw money at sorting out universal credit. The real story was not the latest attempt to boost home ownership but the news from the Office for Budget Responsibility on the state of the economy. This was little short of calamitous. For the past 100 years and more the UK has gradually got a bit better at doing things. New machines have been introduced. Workers have become more skilled. More has been produced with less effort and as a result living standards have risen steadily. Until the financial crisis, this improvement in productivity averaged 2% a year, with periods of stronger growth in the 1950s and 1960s balancing out the bad times, such as the 1920s and early 1930s. The OBR, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent forecasting body, says this long-term trend has been broken. Britain can no longer expect productivity growth of around 2% a year; instead it will have to make do with around 1% a year. Before the financial crisis, the UK was at or near the top of the G7 league table; now it is at the bottom. Inevitable consequences flow from this. Slower growth means individuals and companies pay less tax. Unless public spending is cut, that means the government has to borrow more. It is now more than 10 years since the start of the financial crisis and the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy outlook marks the moment when Britain has to stop kidding itself.

A weaker pound has driven up the cost of goods imported from abroad and fed through to higher inflation, which is expected to peak at 3% by the end of 2017.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy has slowed this year as households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real incomes and spending have been squeezed by higher inflation. The persistence of weak productivity growth does not bode well for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential in the years ahead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OBR said, in a gloomy assessment of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have lowered our real GDP forecast in every year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>The OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of GDP growth is now more pessimistic than that of the Bank of England, which is predicting increases of 1.6%, 1.6% and 1.7% over the next three years compared with the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.3% over the same period. </p> \n<p>Brexit-related uncertainty is affecting firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for investing in new machinery, technology and people, with dire consequences for productivity, according to the OBR, because such advances would allow businesses to produce more in less time.</p> \n<p>It conceded it had been too optimistic about the prospect of a pick-up in productivity, which has stalled since the financial crisis. The productivity slowdown has limited growth, weighed on living standards and put the UK behind most of its peers in the G7 group of leading industrial nations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2017-11-22T18:08:54/embed.html\" data-alt=\"growth forecasts\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2017-11-22T18:08:54/embed.html\">growth forecasts</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In its latest assessment for the health of the economy, the OBR finally abandoned its previously consistent view that productivity growth would return to its pre-crisis trend of about 2% a year. It now expects productivity growth of just 0.9% this year, rising to 1.2% in 2022, with a knock-on effect on overall economic growth.</p> \n<p>The Resolution Foundation thinktank said family finances would be hard hit by weaker productivity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That downgrade has huge implications for family finances over the remainder of the parliament. Disposable incomes are now expected to be \u00c2\u00a3540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the thinktank said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pay is not set to return to its 2008 peak until the middle of the next decade, with Britain now facing a 17-year pay downturn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>The weaker outlook for growth is expected to place greater strain on the public finances over the coming years, with borrowing expected to be cumulatively \u00c2\u00a329bn higher by 2021-22 than the OBR predicted in March. However, the higher borrowing total also reflects the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to ease the pace of austerity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by spending more on a number of budget giveaways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as weaker growth.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The chancellor has been bolder than widely expected and has bowed to pressure to ease the near-term pace of the fiscal consolidation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p> \n<p>Despite raising its forecasts for total borrowing over the five-year forecast horizon, the OBR revised down its prediction for 2017-18 to \u00c2\u00a349.9bn from \u00c2\u00a358.3bn in March. </p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector borrowing is lower today than we expected in March, but the revisions to our economy forecast weaken the outlook for tax receipts and put upward pressure on borrowing in future years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chote said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On top of the forecast changes, the government has announced a fiscal giveaway that adds to borrowing in all but the last year of the forecast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> \n<p>Chote said the government was unlikely to run a surplus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where government income exceeds expenditure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until 2031, meaning the government would miss its target of eliminating the deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where expenditure exceeds income \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by 2025. </p> \n<p>Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the outlook for the public finances could be worse than the OBR suggests. </p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is encouraging that government borrowing for this financial year is now expected to be lower than in their previous forecast. However, over the next few years, the pressure on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is likely to increase by more than the OBR is currently predicting, in the face of subdued growth and weak productivity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> \n<p>The OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts suggest that net debt as share of GDP is expected to fall to 86.4% in 2018-19 from 86.5% in the current year, allowing the chancellor to meet one of his fiscal targets.</p>",

A weaker pound has driven up the cost of goods imported from abroad and fed through to higher inflation, which is expected to peak at 3% by the end of 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy has slowed this year as households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real incomes and spending have been squeezed by higher inflation. The persistence of weak productivity growth does not bode well for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential in the years ahead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OBR said, in a gloomy assessment of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have lowered our real GDP forecast in every year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of GDP growth is now more pessimistic than that of the Bank of England, which is predicting increases of 1.6%, 1.6% and 1.7% over the next three years compared with the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.5%, 1.4% and 1.3% over the same period. Brexit-related uncertainty is affecting firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for investing in new machinery, technology and people, with dire consequences for productivity, according to the OBR, because such advances would allow businesses to produce more in less time. It conceded it had been too optimistic about the prospect of a pick-up in productivity, which has stalled since the financial crisis. The productivity slowdown has limited growth, weighed on living standards and put the UK behind most of its peers in the G7 group of leading industrial nations. In its latest assessment for the health of the economy, the OBR finally abandoned its previously consistent view that productivity growth would return to its pre-crisis trend of about 2% a year. It now expects productivity growth of just 0.9% this year, rising to 1.2% in 2022, with a knock-on effect on overall economic growth. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said family finances would be hard hit by weaker productivity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That downgrade has huge implications for family finances over the remainder of the parliament. Disposable incomes are now expected to be \u00c2\u00a3540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the thinktank said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pay is not set to return to its 2008 peak until the middle of the next decade, with Britain now facing a 17-year pay downturn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The weaker outlook for growth is expected to place greater strain on the public finances over the coming years, with borrowing expected to be cumulatively \u00c2\u00a329bn higher by 2021-22 than the OBR predicted in March. However, the higher borrowing total also reflects the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to ease the pace of austerity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by spending more on a number of budget giveaways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as weaker growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The chancellor has been bolder than widely expected and has bowed to pressure to ease the near-term pace of the fiscal consolidation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Despite raising its forecasts for total borrowing over the five-year forecast horizon, the OBR revised down its prediction for 2017-18 to \u00c2\u00a349.9bn from \u00c2\u00a358.3bn in March. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector borrowing is lower today than we expected in March, but the revisions to our economy forecast weaken the outlook for tax receipts and put upward pressure on borrowing in future years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chote said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On top of the forecast changes, the government has announced a fiscal giveaway that adds to borrowing in all but the last year of the forecast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chote said the government was unlikely to run a surplus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where government income exceeds expenditure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until 2031, meaning the government would miss its target of eliminating the deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where expenditure exceeds income \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by 2025. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the outlook for the public finances could be worse than the OBR suggests. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is encouraging that government borrowing for this financial year is now expected to be lower than in their previous forecast. However, over the next few years, the pressure on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position is likely to increase by more than the OBR is currently predicting, in the face of subdued growth and weak productivity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts suggest that net debt as share of GDP is expected to fall to 86.4% in 2018-19 from 86.5% in the current year, allowing the chancellor to meet one of his fiscal targets.",

Over the last month, key barometers of sentiment among companies about business activity pointed to the strongest economic growth for half a year, even as optimism among firms about the future evaporated to the lowest levels seen in 15 months. The Markit/CIPS purchasing mangers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key services sector recorded a big jump in October, coming in at 55.6 from 53.6 a month earlier. The PMI measures, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures. There was more positive news for squeezed British households, facing almost two decades without pay returning above pre-financial crisis levels, that inflation held steady in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c against expectations from the Bank of England for a rise. Cheaper fuel and deep discounting by retailers cancelled out the impact of surging food prices to leave the consumer price index (CPI) at 3% for the second consecutive month. High street sales also beat City expectations by bouncing back in October, gaining by 0.3% compared with a monthly drop of 0.7% seen in September. Still, on an annual basis the UK recorded its first year-on-year drop in consumer spending since 2013, illustrating the pressures facing households from the rising cost of living. Economists will be looking at the key Christmas shopping period ahead as well as the outcome of the Black Friday discounting period in November to gauge the resilience of consumer spending, which is a key driver for the health of the economy. Official figures appear to show England becoming a happier place in the year since the Brexit vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite research showing that households are now each \u00c2\u00a3600 a year worse off after the referendum. Measures for happiness and wellbeing showed no change for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there are worrying signals for the road ahead. Hammond revealed at the budget a painful downgrade in economic growth of around half a percentage point annually in the coming years. Jobs figures showed the first fall in the number of people in work since 2013 in the three months to September, in the first signs that the employment boom of recent years could be coming to an end. There was no change in the jobless rate in the latest figures, staying at the lowest levels since 1975. However, the low jobless rate is still having little impact on the wages of British workers, despite expectations for their bargaining power to demand higher pay and better working conditions to improve. There was no increase for the annual rate of earnings growth, remaining at 2.2% in the three months ending in September from the same level for the period ending in August. Still, the strong levels of employment growth in the earlier months of this year have been positive for the public finances, with the Treasury raking in more money from taxes than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for the year to the end of October. But rising inflation has also pushed up the cost of debt interest paid by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leading to a worse than expected performance for the public finances last month. There are questions about the strength of the economy over the coming months, after some business leaders have suggested failure to agree a transitional deal to smooth Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU over several years after the end of article 50 talks by the end of 2017, or early 2018 at the latest, will force them to alter their investment decisions or move staff to other countries. The government is mired in talks over the Irish border, while ministers must also make sufficient progress on a financial settlement with Brussels to leave the EU as well as reach an agreement over the rights of EU citizens in the UK. The OBR did not factor in failure to reach a deal over Brexit into its gloomy forecasts for the health of the economy alongside the budget. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC, said this was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unduly optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that deadlock will put business investment on hold. This in turn will limit productivity growth in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which the OBR estimates will pick-up over the coming five years, albeit at a slower pace than forecast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no reason at all, in my view, to believe any take-off in productivity will happen any time soon,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Blanchflower, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy could grow much more slowly than even the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrid forecasts. I am still waiting for any good news from Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Better than forecast Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs boom shows signs of slowing The first signs that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs boom of recent years is coming to an end emerged in the past month, as figures from the Office for National Statistics show a 14,000 fall in the number in work in the three months to September \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first decline since April 2013. Meanwhile, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses were 2.2% higher in the same period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no change on the upwardly revised figures for the period ending in August. That was slightly better than City expectations for wages to rise by 2.1%. Better than forecast Retail sales see first annual decline since 2013 High street sales bounced back in October, gaining by 0.3% compared with a monthly drop of 0.7% in September, beating expectations. Still, on an annual basis the UK recorded its first year-on-year drop in consumer spending since 2013, illustrating the pressure facing households from the rising cost of living. The uptick in inflation helped push the volume of goods bought in shops and online down by 0.3% from October 2016. Economists will be looking at the key Christmas shopping period ahead to gauge the resilience of consumer spending, which is a key driver for the health of the economy. Worse than forecast Clouds gather over the housing market The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market has stalled, with fewer people looking to buy a new home and prices barely rising across the UK. The survey of property professionals found only 1% who expect house prices will rise nationally, down from 6% in September, which fell short of forecasts by City economists for a balance of 4%. Interest from buyers continued to drop, with 20% more surveyors reporting a fall in new buyer inquiries than an increase. Nearly two-thirds of surveyors reported a drop in prices over the month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the poorest reading since the depth of the financial crisis in 2009. And another thing we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned this month \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 English citizens are happier since the Brexit vote Despite research showing British households are each more than \u00c2\u00a3600 a year worse off after the vote to leave the EU, rising inflation, low wage growth and political turmoil, England is now officially happier than ever before a year after the Brexit vote. Key barometers of happiness and wellbeing measured by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed small improvements over the year to the end of June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first 12-month period since the referendum. But even though there was an increase in England, there was no change in reported personal wellbeing recorded in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Perhaps most surprisingly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given terror attacks this year and an election that led one woman from Bristol to cry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not another one!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ONS found no change in anxiety levels compared with a year ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses.</p> <p>The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid.

Therefore we must be wary that the political consensus to pay a bigger bill could unravel; and paying a big bill does not by definition lead to a good trade deal.

                "bodyText":"A mixed day for Europe, but with little real movement on most of the major markets. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved higher after positive remarks on the economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, but technology stocks have come under pressure. Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, told Reuters: What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing is a combination of defence positioning, with people taking some profit out of the high-growth areas, technology specifically, and rotating into sectors that should hold up better if we get any negative news on the tax bill or debt ceiling. Meanwhile bitcoin is currently up nearly 9% at $10,741 although off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs of 11,395. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 67.09 points or 0.9% at 7393.56 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.02% to 13,061.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5398.05 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 22,325.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.22% better at 10,267.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.67% to 738.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 67 points or 0.28%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. But there are some less positive developments in Greece, too. Helena Smith writes: In Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil court, police have fired rounds of tear gas and been engaged in hand to hand battle with protestors opposing first electronic auctions demanded by creditors in bid to finally deal with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountain of bad bank loans. Over in Greece, some positive developments. The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn, writes Helena Smith: Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a huge development ... and of huge significance for the country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses. The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end. One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%. Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. She made positive noises about the US economy, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This makes a December rate rise even more likely, which has helped banking shares, and more increases could follow. Yellen said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is continuing its surge higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a relatively sluggish few weeks the Dow has burst into life in the last couple of sessions. Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up another 80 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress in pushing through his \u00e2\u20ac\u201c increasingly unpopular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate. What goes up... Bitcoin is now at $10,479, down from its peak today of $11,395 but still up from the $9,868 it opened at. Back in the UK, the national minimum wage received by the lowest-paid workers is in the spotlight. The Low Pay Commission, which recommends the minimum wage rates, said in its annual report published this morning that the new rates for 18-20 and 21-24 year olds follow the biggest rise for both age groups in a decade. We already know the rates, which were published last week as part of the budget, but analysis in the report that shows increases from 1 April 2018 of 4.7% and 5.4% respectively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will benefit between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the largest up-rating since 2007. A lower percentage rise has been applied to the National Living Wage (NLW), which covers those aged 25 years old and beyond, of 4.4 per cent. Forecasts for average earnings growth next year fall between 2.5% and 3% the commission said. The weakest rise is being handed to 16 and 17 year olds, who must survive on \u00c2\u00a34.20, up 3.7% on this year. The commission said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new rates will boost the earnings of between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly, and many more young workers will benefit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is for two reasons: firstly, these increases lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspillover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effects further up the pay distribution; secondly, even though they are not entitled to it, some young workers benefit from increases in the NLW. We estimate that up to 45% of 18-24 year old workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or 1.3 million young people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could receive a higher pay increase than they would have done in the absence of the NLW.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boom! The US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both climbed to new levels, following the upgrade in US growth in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, sums up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second estimate of US GDP shows the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is clearly firing on all cylinders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If Donald Trump takes his fingers off the retweet button, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll notice that the US economy appears to be doing pretty well on his watch. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics on the new growth figures: Third-quarter GDP growth was revised up modestly to 3.3% annualised, from 3.0%, thanks to a stronger positive contribution from business investment and a much smaller drag from State and local government expenditure. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers was revised up as well to 2.5%, from 2.3%. Business investment growth is now estimated to have been 4.7% annualised, with equipment investment up by 10.4%. With borrowing costs still relatively low, confidence strong and capex intentions surveys at elevated levels, we expect another decent gain in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin just smashed through $11,000, defying the doubters with their taunts about tulip bulbs.... Despite its summer surge, the US hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grown quite as fast as the eurozone over the last year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortably outpacing Britain, though.... Economists are cheering the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 3.3% (annualised) in the last three months. This upward revision suggests the US is in decent shape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: BREAKING: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2017. Fresh figures from the Commerce Department shows that US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.3% in July-September, up from a first estimate of 3.0%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equal to a quarterly growth rate of over 0.8% -- twice as fast as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% in Q3. The new data shows that corporate profits boosted growth, jumping by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter. Net trade also boosted growth, with exports up by 2.2% but imports down by 1.1%. Reaction to follow.... German bank Berenberg has raised their forecasts for UK growth over the next couple of years, on optimism that a hard Brexit can be avoided. They say: We raise our calls for real GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 to 1.8% and 1.9% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, following modest increases to our growth projections for household consumption and business investment. Our forecasts exceed Bloomberg consensus (29 November 2017) of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. We see risks to the growth outlook as roughly balanced. Foreign exchange news site DailyFX flags up that the pound has outperformed other currencies against the dollar today: The price of bitcoin is going up even faster than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential Brexit bill. The cryptocurrency smashed through the $10,000 mark overnight, and is currently changing hands at $10,900. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risen by around 1,000% during 2017. Five years ago, you could have bought a bitcoin for only $12.... The higher bitcoin goes, the louder are the warnings that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unsustainable speculative bubble. But then, I can remember the same warnings back in 2013! Sir Jon Cunliffe, the BoE deputy governor, has suggested that potential bitcoin investors should be cautious. He told BBC Radio 5 this morning that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no central bank that stands behind it. For me it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more like a commodity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not at a size where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to Brexit, and the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katya Adler reports that some EU officials are irritated that the \u00c2\u00a350bn settlement hit the headlines last night. Although they do want money from the UK, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be bounced into an agreement. They also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that any payment will guarantee Britain the post-Brexit deal it wants... She writes: If and when an agreement on the Brexit bill is made, the EU will push back hard at UK government assertions that Brexit financial payments be tied to a future trade and transition deal. Brussels insists this is money the UK owes - dating back to commitments made on annual and long-term budgets while an EU member. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not blood money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an EU civil servant told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is money the UK must pay on leaving the EU. The new relationship post-Brexit Britain will have with the EU is something quite separate. Europe is not about to be blackmailed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from Brexit briefly, shipping company Clarksons has admitted it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hacked. Clarksons told the City that it has been working with the police since discovering a cybersecurity incident which involved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unauthorised access to the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer systems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It warned shareholders that those responsible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may release some data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today. Andi Case, CEO of Clarksons, has hinted that the company refused to pay the hackers to return stolen data, saying: I hope our clients understand that we would not be held to ransom by criminals, and I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have understandably raised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More evidence that the eurozone economy is ending 2017 on a high, from the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest health check: Despite Brexit uncertainty, individuals and businesses in Europe are increasingly optimistic. New data from the European Commission shows that eurozone consumer and economic confidence jumped again in November, to their highest level in 17 years. Newsflash: UK households reined in their borrowing last month. Unsecured consumer credit (such as borrowing on credit cards) grew by 9.6% in October compared to a year ago, down from 9.8% in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest rise since April 2016, and follows concerns that people were being driven into debt by rising inflation and falling real wages. New Bank of England figures also show a fall in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, down to 64,575 in October from over 66,000 in September. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has defended the government against criticism that it might stump up \u00c2\u00a350bn to leave the EU. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme that the UK has financial obligations to settle, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think people in this country would expect us to just walk away from things we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already said we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bonus marks to anyone who spotted that on the side of a bus last year. Anyway, Andrew Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster today: The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has sounded a cautious note about the \u00c2\u00a350bn figure. Collared by reporters in Berlin this morning, Barnier suggested that a deal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed yet. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are still working. ....I am working for an agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has rallied against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all of its 16 major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rival currencies this morning, reports Bloomberg. Even if a \u00c2\u00a350bn bill is agreed, Britain faces several hurdles to jump before it can avoid a disorderly Brexit. As well as the Irish question, Brussels also wants commitments on EU citizen rights beyond 2019. Plus, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that parliament will approve a hefty divorce bill. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital says: First, can Theresa May sell this to voters and to her party. She seems to have some shaky consensus backing for a higher offer but this is contingent on getting a good trade deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the EU will not have its hands tied in this way. Therefore we must be wary that the political consensus to pay a bigger bill could unravel; and paying a big bill does not by definition lead to a good trade deal. Capitulating to the EU in this regard carries its own risks for Theresa May, but the risk of a no-deal exit was ultimately too high. Second, the Irish border is still a major stumbling block and it is uncertain whether sufficient progress has been made on this front. This is an even more sensitive topic than the divorce bill and is not as easy to solve with a bigger cheque. The third key barrier for the EU is citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights and again it is unclear if there is sufficient progress in this regard. Sterling has jumped by 1.4% against a basket of currencies, its biggest rise since April, according to Reuters data. Christmas has come early for Brussels, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank wryly. He expects an official agreement on the Brexit bill next month, following the news that the UK has caved in to demands for a \u00c2\u00a350bn payment. We expect UK PM Theresa May to present a formal offer on the Brexit bill, EU citizens rights, and the Irish border question at the upcoming 4 December dinner between May and EU Commission president Juncker. We expect the offer to meet the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirement for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsufficient progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the Brexit divorce. If such progress is made, expect the UK and the EU to move negotiations on to potential transitional arrangements and post-Brexit trade at the 14-15 December EU Summit. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit bill is only one part of the Brexit puzzle, of course. We still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any idea how the Irish border question will be resolved; Dublin could block negotiations on trade unless its fears over a hard border are assuaged. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Picking up the Brexit bill has been the very thorny issue since day one and given that now the government has agreed to a respectable amount, the talks between the UK and the EU (which are set to resume next month) should be smoother. If the EU accepts the bill, then we will be moving to the next hurdle which is securing the EU rights [of citizens living in the UK. It is important to keep in mind that we are no way close to be out of the woods when it comes to the smooth negotiation process because the Northern Ireland issue is still the thorny matter. The pound is continuing to climb against the US dollar as investors bet that the Brexit fog is clearing. As Stephen Gallo at the Bank of Montreal put it (via the FT): It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buy! The risk of snap election is down, the risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is down, the path to a transition deal is clearing. The surge in the pound has hit shares in the City. The FTSE 100 is down 31 points at 7429; a stronger sterling reduces the value of money earned overseas by UK-based multinationals. The prospect that Britain and the EU might shake hands on a Brexit bill next month is exciting the City this morning. \u00c2\u00a350bn is obviously a lot of money, even if split over many years. But traders think it could be worth it, if it opens the door to trade talks. Konstantinos Anthis of brokerage firm ADS Securities explains: Even though the agreement is not yet formal traders are clearly excited by the prospect of progress on this issue. Traders are looking for any positive news in this area as it opens the way for trade negotiations, and are prepared to buy sterling in response. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Sterling is on a roll this morning, amid signs that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit breakthrough. The pound has jumped to $1.3406, up almost three quarters of a cent, to its highest level since the end of September. It is also pushing higher against the euro, up 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. The rally was triggered by reports that London could pay a \u00c2\u00a350bn exit bill, in an attempt to nudge European politicians into starting negotiations about trade. A deal would ease fears that Britain could crash out of the EU in March 2019 in a disorderly Brexit. EU leaders will decide next month whether this is enough to move negotiations onto trade, so this could be a very significant moment. As my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin reported last night: Non-stop behind-the-scenes negotiations have led to a broad agreement by the UK to a gross financial settlement of \u00c2\u00a389bn on leaving the bloc, although the British expect the final net bill to be half as much. A senior EU official told the Guardian that the UK appeared ready to honour its share of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpaid bills, loans, pension and other liabilities accrued over 44 years of membership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have heard the UK wants to come along with the money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the official said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have understood it covers the liabilities and what we consider the real commitments. But we have to see the fine print.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bill could total \u00c2\u00a353bn to \u00c2\u00a358bn (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65bn), although EU officials are not discussing numbers and the British government will fight hard to bring the total down. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking City reaction to the news, along with new data showing the state of the UK, US and eurozone economies.
