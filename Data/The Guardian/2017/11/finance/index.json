We expect earnings season to propel stocks to further gains. However, signs of inflation and the potential of a melt-up do pose some risks.

On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned.</p> <p>Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event.</p> <p>When it comes to the statement, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d/0_0_2000_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Powell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Powell<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite. Prior to that he was Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. Before that he was a lawyer and investment banker in New York.</p> <p>The second candidate often mentioned is John Taylor, who was Treasury Under-Secretary for International Affairs, 2001- 2005, and who developed the Taylor Rule, discussed below, as a means of describing the way in which the Fed sets interest rates.</p> <p>While these two candidates are the current favourites, it is of course possible that somebody else will be appointed, or that Chair Yellen will be reappointed.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59f9f58357bca206682cbde1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-01T16:56:04.004Z\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets close mainly higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As US investors await the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision, most European markets have ended the first day of the new month on a positive note.</p> <p>Buoyed by weakness in the euro after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, French, German and Italian markets have closed in positive territory, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax in particular playing catch up after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public holiday.

                "bodyText":"Commenting on the Fed decision, Kully Samra, UK managing director of Charles Schwab, said: A widely expected move from the Fed with market consensus anticipating one further rate hike in December. A more aggressive Fed could have posed a problem for equities, but for now the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s methodical approach to monetary policy tightening is reassuring investors and ensuring the continuation of the bull run. The Fed has an important balancing act to play as it slowly continues to normalise monetary policy by gradually lifting interest rates and unwinding its bloated balance sheet. We expect earnings season to propel stocks to further gains. However, signs of inflation and the potential of a melt-up do pose some risks. The US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook is also bolstered by broadly strengthening global economic growth and the continued rise in global earnings may support further stock market gains. So on Thursday we are due to get the perhaps more important Fed news - Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick for the next chair of the US central bank. Also coming up is the Bank of England rate decision, which is widely expected to see the first rise for a decade. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One key point from the Fed statement. It says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In September it said economic activity \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been rising moderately so far this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slightly more positive comment adds to the idea of a rate rise in December. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comparison of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed statement with the September comments: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. And the comments about changes in rates are unchanged from the September meeting: In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking News: The Federal Reserve has kept US interest rates on hold, as expected, but left open the prospect of an increase at its December meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING from earlier today on the Fed: The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate decision is due in less than an hour, and while no change is expected this time round, analysts will be looking for clues as to whether a rise is nailed on for December. Given the relatively strong economic data recently, this seems fairly probable, but the observers will be looking out for clues from the nuances of the accompanying statement. In some ways the Fed decision is not the most important event for the US central bank this week. On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned. Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event. When it comes to the statement, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to. Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December. Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair: The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite. Prior to that he was Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. Before that he was a lawyer and investment banker in New York. The second candidate often mentioned is John Taylor, who was Treasury Under-Secretary for International Affairs, 2001- 2005, and who developed the Taylor Rule, discussed below, as a means of describing the way in which the Fed sets interest rates. While these two candidates are the current favourites, it is of course possible that somebody else will be appointed, or that Chair Yellen will be reappointed. As US investors await the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision, most European markets have ended the first day of the new month on a positive note. Buoyed by weakness in the euro after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, French, German and Italian markets have closed in positive territory, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax in particular playing catch up after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public holiday. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex, however, has edged lower on profit taking after its recent gains, which were prompted by fading fears about the Catalan independence demands. The FTSE 100 slipped back despite a positive performance from the mining sector after Chinese manufacturing data. Next proved a drag on the index after its badly received results, and helped pull other retailers lower as well. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher ahead of the Fed news. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 5.12 points or 0.07% to 7487.96 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.78% to 13,465.51 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.2% at 5514.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.87% at 22,991.99 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.16% at 10,506.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.02% to 767.07 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently up 49 points or 0.21%. The main focus for US investors is the Federal Reserve meeting later - widely expected to keep rates on hold but hit at an increase in December - and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick for the next Fed chair. Meanwhile the US economic data continues to be strong. As well as the reasonable manufacturing data, there were also some positive jobs numbers, ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official non-farm payroll numbers. The monthly ADP report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, better than the 200,000 figures analysts had been expecting. It was also much better than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 110,000 figure, albeit this was revised down from the initial estimate of a 135,000 increase. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was a pretty strong afternoon for US data. The ADP non-farm employment change reading hit 235k, sharply higher than last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 110k, to set up a potentially massive \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcofficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 number on Friday, while the final Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in a tad higher than forecast at 54.6. Only the ISM manufacturing figure disappointed, and even then, at 58.7, it was a more than respectable number. The dollar was the main beneficiary of all this (the Dow Jones lost roughly a third of its early gains, though after rising 100 points it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at a fresh all time high). The greenback reversed its initial losses against the pound to climb 0.1%-0.2%, sending cable back below $1.33, while against the euro it jumped 0.2%. This reaction was assumedly related to the hawkish-tinge of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, with investors hoping the Federal Reserve tees up a December rate hike with this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Estate agent Jones Lang LaSalle has just published its latest forecasts for UK house price growth in the next five years. It has pencilled in an average of 2.5% growth a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from an average of 6.9% in the last 20 years. The firm is predicting a big shift to a more stable housing market with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more moderate UK house price growth over the next five to ten years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - despite Brexit. Growth is expected to average just 1% next year but then pick up to 2% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020, 3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022. Transactions are also set to slow, averaging 1.23m a year over the next five years. The firm said: Brexit will not get in the way of a more stable and healthy UK housing market. In central London we expect demand for new developments to remain muted but steady over the next two years until the Brexit road becomes clearer. A bedrock of demand will continue from domestic owner-occupiers supported by a steady stream of international buyers and investors. Activity in prime central London will be subdued for the next two years with continued pressure on pricing especially at the top end of the market where stamp duty impacts are greatest. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector continues to be rattled by Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are certainly out of fashion, down 8.5% right now at the bottom of the FTSE 100 losers column. Other retailers are sharing the gloom; Marks &amp; Spencer have lost 4%, Dixons Carphone have lost 2%, and Ocado are down 1.9%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d all be vulnerable to a slowdown in consumer spending (which might accelerate if the Bank of England raises interest rates tomorrow). Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors are worried that Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street sales slumped by 7.7% over the last quarter. These results are a reflection of the wider issues facing the retail sector. Investors continue to face challenges to their spending power as well as the structural shift to online shopping. Moreover, the vagaries of the British weather have only proved to be a hindrance. We have in general been fairly pessimistic towards the retail sector and nothing has really changed that sentiment. Over in Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has announced that Athens is likely to make at least four market forays before its current bailout programme expires next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a late night interview, the Oxford-educated finance minister confirmed reports that Greece was poised to tap bond markets again saying the foray was a purposeful move to improve the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt profile. He told the state new channel ERT-1 that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue is to have access to markets when we exit the programme,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a bid to prepare the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and make Greek bonds more attractive - Athens plans at least four market forays in the run up to August 2018 when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn euro aid programme officially ends. To boost liquidity the government is considering swapping twenty bonds issued in 2012 after a restructuring of Greek debt held by private investors for four or five new bonds. Hinting that a test run was imminent, Tskakalotos said investors would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand [Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] return\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to bond markets before international auditors representing creditors at the EU and IMF, wrap up a third compliance review as part of the bailout programme. The review is expected to be completed by January after inspectors return to the country at the end of November. Once concluded, Greece will start negotiating the terms of its exit from international supervision. At 180 % of GDP, Greece has the highest debt load in the EU. There are also reports that a senior EU official in Brussels has suggested that debt relief could be linked to further reforms once the current bailout programme ends. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector appears to be in good health, says Michael Pierce of Capital Economics. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing data: The small drop back in the ISM Manufacturing Index in October from a 13-year high is little to worry about, and still suggests that manufacturing output will rebound in the fourth quarter. The drop back in the headline index, from 60.8 to 58.7, took it back almost exactly in line with its value in August. Perversely, some of the decline in the index this month reflects an unwinding of hurricane effects. The disruption to supply chains caused delivery times to surge in September (interpreted in the ISM index as a positive sign of stronger demand), which was partly reversed last month. ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival US manufacturing survey is also out, and it suggests growth slowed but remained very strong: Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is expanding at its fastest rate since January. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US manufacturing PMI rose to 54.6 in October, up from 53.1 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortably over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. US factory bosses also reported that they took on more staff last month, at the fastest pace in over two years. This comes hot on the heels of some other strong jobs data today, showing that US firms hired staff at the fastest rate in 18 months. Wall Street traders have held a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence as a mark of respect for those who were killed in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truck attack in New York. Trading is now underway, and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have both hit new record highs as the market rally continues. Labour MP Wes Streeting says the government must heed the warning that 75,000 City jobs could be lost through Brexit, and avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure from the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that British companies are already preparing to shift jobs abroad as a result of Brexit. Our economy is being damaged now, with growth slowing and prices rising, and the situation is set to get worse as a hard and destructive Brexit gets closer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only by keeping Britain in the Single Market can the Government reassure financial services firms and stem job losses. But they have made an ideological choice to wrench our country out of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were told that Brexit would not lead to job losses. As people see the harm that is being done to our economy, they have every right to keep on open mind on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the House of Lords, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe has warned that the regulation of financial clearing houses could suffer after Brexit. These clearing houses sit between investors, settling trades, and (hopefully) avoiding financial contagion breaking out. European officials argue that they should supervise euro clearing (much of which takes place in London today). But Cunliffe fears this would lead to disruption. He told the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to make sure you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up with multiple hands on the steering wheel and multiple feet on the brake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BoE is also concerned that huge numbers of cross-border derivative contracts and insurance policies would be disrupted by Brexit. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there could be no agreement on how these derivatives contracts are regulated. Deputy governor Sam Woods says negotiators need to find a solution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By far the best fix would be for something to be included in the withdrawal bill. There would have to be bilateral agreement to fix this on both sides.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite fears over Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Anglo-Irish trade, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer exports to the UK are up by 12%, it emerged today. Enterprise Ireland said the export of Irish consumer goods and services is now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m. The Irish government business agency puts a lot of the rise in exports to Britain down to better use of online sales and other innovations. Allyson Stephen, market advisor at Enterprise Ireland said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a crowded market such as Britain, knowing your market is essential before targeting buyers and while there are similarities between Irish and British consumers, in a business context there are vital differences, such as continuous and new and developing routes to market which must be recognised. Back in the City, Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares ares still down over 7% after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing sales update. That, by my maths, wipes \u00c2\u00a3540m off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation, from \u00c2\u00a37.17bn to around \u00c2\u00a36.6bn. That makes Next the worst performing stock on the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies). My colleague Angela Monaghan explains what went wrong: Investors took fright on Thursday after Next reported a fall in high street sales and warned trading was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of its crucial Christmas selling period. Next shares fell by 8%, making it the biggest loser on the FTSE 100, after the clothing retailer said sales at its shops fell by 7.7% in the three months to 29 October. Thanks to a 13.2% increase in Directory sales, including online, total sales for full-price items rose by 1.3% over the quarter. However, some analysts had been expecting total sales growth of more than 4%. More here: Another deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, tells the Lords committee that City firms will assume a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario on Brexit, unless they can see what the final \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcend framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a deal will be. Simply agreeing a transition period, with no clarity about what the final agreement might be, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough..... Over at the House of Lords, Sam Woods, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has told peers that 10,000 City jobs could be lost on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit. Testifying to the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, Woods also says that the BoE believes it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plausible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that up to 75,000 roles could go in the long-term, as consultancy Oliver Wyman has estimated. Woods, who runs the regulatory arm of the Bank, has already asked 400 banks and financial firms for their contingency plans in the event of a hard Brexit. He said that some of those plans were already being put in place - reserving school places, hiring office space etc - but that plans would be put in place in earnest in the first quarter of the year. You can watch the session online here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news highlights the dilemma facing the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers, as they try to decide whether to raise interest rates tomorrow. On one side, they have one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailers reporting weak, volatile sales - a sign that consumers are vulnerable and cutting back. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to leave borrowing costs unchanged. On the other, they can see Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories growing steadily, with production rising and - perhaps crucially for the BoE - price pressures rising. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to raise borrowing costs towards more normal levels, probably bolstering the pound and pulling inflation down. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out at noon on Thursday whether the Monetary Policy Committee has voted for its first interest rate rise in a decade.... Importantly, UK factories which produce consumer goods are lagging behind the rest of the sector, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. Markit says: Intermediate and investment goods producers both saw rising production volumes backed up by strong and accelerated intakes of new business. Conditions seemed less firm in the consumer goods category, however, as growth of new orders eased to a seven-month low and business optimism to its weakest level in the year-to-date. The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers grew at a faster pace in October has cheered industry experts and City economists. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see the manufacturing sector holding strong and steady in October, buoyed up by an increase in new orders from the domestic market and improving on last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. While trade from export markets slowed slightly, orders from overseas continued to rise for the 18th month supported by a robust global economy. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuating performance may have had some bearing on the softening in export orders, but there were continuing good levels of demand from Europe and the USA so no cause for concern. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK manufacturing sector has recorded another month well above the magic 50 mark that signifies growth and continues to perform well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the ongoing Brexit negotiations are causing uncertainty, recent CBI data shows orders and outputs are above historic levels, and similar trends are seen in exporting data. Firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans for investment in innovation remain strong, as does spending on training and development. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Month after month, manufacturing continues to hold its own delivering growth levels that keep the sector in positive territory. Although demand from both home and overseas markets remains robust, manufacturers will have half an eye on what the MPC decides to do tomorrow and the potential impact an interest rate rise would have on sterling. They will also be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement and what that may bring by way of a boost for the sector and I suspect many will be looking for R&amp;D tax credits to feature and encourage a much needed increase in investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister will be pleased to see an above-expectations hike in manufacturing output in October, particularly after a bigger than expected fall the month prior. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153British business is still trying to balance Brexit uncertainty against a weak currency-led boost to exports, but with the sterling creeping upwards of late, foreign demand may not hold for long. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say whether UK industry is out the woods just yet, with pressure on the sector likely to persist until more political clarity is found both domestically and on the continent. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While UK exports have increased in recent months, levels have yet to reach the heights that the devalued Sterling and strengthening economic performance in the Eurozone and global markets promised. Clearly, British manufacturers are prioritising profit margins over exports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of visibility over the future direction of Brexit negotiations is holding back major investment initiatives in the sector that might have boosted productivity. Without a clearer picture to support those decisions, there are concerns that UK manufacturing will fall behind in the global technology race and struggle to compete. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Input costs continue to weigh down on margins and a possible uptick in the interest rate from the Bank of England will add further pressure. Businesses will need to be vigilant of a potential rise in financial risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK manufacturing PMI report has pushed the pound over $1.33 for the first time in two weeks. Breaking! UK factories grew faster than expected last month, thanks to a surge in new orders. Data firm Markit reports that manufacturing output and new order growth remained robust in October, suggesting that the weak pound is helping factories. However, the fall in sterling is also pushing up the cost of raw materials, and finished products too. Markit says: The UK manufacturing sector started the final quarter of the year on a solid footing. Production and new order volumes continued to rise at robust rates, as companies benefited from strong domestic market conditions and rising inflows of new export business. Price pressures remained elevated, however, with rates of inflation in input costs and output charges both accelerating and staying well above historical series averages. This rise in output pushed the UK manufacturing PMI up to 56.3, which shows stronger growth. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading has been revised higher too. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturing made an impressive start to the final quarter of 2017 as increased inflows of new work encouraged firms to ramp up production once again. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says the 7.7% slide in Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street sales over the last quarter is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsickening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He writes: If such a distinguished guru as Simon Wolfson of Next finds it impossible to read the underlying sales trends, because of the volatility of the weather, then what are we mere mortals to do?... Some people in the City expected full-price sales to be nearly 4.5% up in Q3, driven by Next Directory, but the outcome was only +1.3%, with Next Retail down a sickening 7.7% and Next Directory up 13.2% Global Data retail analyst Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien wonders whether Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online ordering system can help: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBC reporter Clodagh Rice: The stock market can be cruel at times. So says George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third quarter performance is actually better than what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen from the group so far this year, but with many expecting a much stronger showing, the shares still took a tumble. While the recent investment in digital marketing seems to have helped the Directory division rediscover its mojo, Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street stores saw an almighty slump this quarter. A particularly weak October means the group enters the all-important Christmas period with less momentum than it would have liked. Salmon add that other retailers could be nervous too... Shareholders in Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, might now be a bit more nervous ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year numbers. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly, ugly morning for Next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says recent positive noises from the company have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come back to haunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures have punctured the optimism that had built up recently. Campbell adds: While Q3 total sales grew 1.3%, an improvement on the 2.2% decline seen in the first half of the year, that was lower than the 2.9% growth expected as the firm warned on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sector landscape. Similarly, though Directory sales rocketed 13.2% higher, retail (i.e. high street) sales plunged a far worse than estimated 7.7%, leading Next to revise its annual pre-tax profit forecasts from \u00c2\u00a3687m-\u00c2\u00a3747m to \u00c2\u00a3692m-\u00c2\u00a3742m. None of these were particularly bad figures; but the expectation created by the past few updates meant these Q3 results couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but disappoint, causing the stock to sink 7.5% to a 7 week nadir. Shares in Next have tumbled by almost 8% at the start of trading. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 368p at \u00c2\u00a345.52. That confirms that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are weaker than the City expected. Other retailers are also suffering, with Marks &amp; Spencer down 3.7% and Associated British Foods (which owns Primark) down 2.5%. UK high street retailer Next has spooked the City by missing its sales forecasts and warning that trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Next, one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key retailers, has reported that sales at its stores shrank by 7.7% in the three months to 29th October. Although directory sales (including online) rose by 13.2%, this means Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total full-price sales only increased by 1.3% over the quarter. Some analysts had expected growth of 4%, so this is a new signal that the UK high street could be weakening. Recent warm weather has hurt clothing retailers, as it has discouraged shoppers from splashing out on a new winter coat. Next says: Sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather. In August and September sales were significantly up on last year, as cooler temperatures improved sales of warmer weight stock. The change in sales trend came at precisely the same time UK temperatures became warmer than last year. But there are also signs that rising inflation, which is outstripping wage growth, is hurting shoppers. Next admits that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on out there: Week by week sales volatility makes it very hard to determine any underlying sales trend. We believe the most reliable guide to sales for the balance of the year are the full price sales for the year to date, which are down -0.3%. Despite the sales slowdown, Next is hoping to make pre-tax profits of \u00c2\u00a3692m to \u00c2\u00a3742m for this financial year. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK manufacturing has a surprisingly good summer, expanding by 1% during the third quarter of 2017 (according to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report). Today we discover whether it maintained that momentum in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because data firm Markit are releasing their latest purchasing managers reports, showing how factories around the world fared last month. Economists predict a solid reading from the UK, with its manufacturing PMI tipped to remain unchanged at 55.9. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities believe the numbers could move the pound: Earlier in the day investors will want to pay attention to the Manufacturing PMI release from the UK which comes a day before tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting on monetary policy. The pound has gained considerably over the past two days as expectations are set for the BoE to hike rates this month and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI release could set the stage for more gains. Royal Bank of Canada say: There was a loss of momentum generally last month in many of the activity sub-components of these surveys but the manufacturing sector is looking the most buoyant. Alas, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until tomorrow to find how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories performed. Nationwide, the estate agent, has reported that house prices rose by 0.2% last month (more on that shortly). Over in America, the Federal Reserve is holding a policy meeting - but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting an interest rate rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI for October 10am GMT: Bank of England deputy governors Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods testify to the House of Lords EU financial affairs committee. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFinancial regulation and supervision following Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 1.30pm GMT: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI for October 2pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for October 6pm GMT: Federal Reserve interest rate decision",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat graphic summing up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK car sales figures: And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Brent crude has now hit a 28-month high, at almost $64 per barrel, as the shockwaves from the Saudi \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorruption crackdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ripple through the oil market. The purge of Saudi princes and officials has sparked speculation that instability in Saudi Arabia could affect oil supplies in the future. Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, explained to Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The geopolitical supply risk premium is starting to bear its head in the market right now because OPEC supply cuts have made it relevant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loewen added that, with supply capped and demand rising, potential risks to supply become more significant. The drop in UK car sales didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter City traders from pushing the Footsie to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing high. Energy firms rose, tracking the oil price after Brent crude hit that two-year high this morning. Mining firms also had a good day, thanks to a pickup in the copper price. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Arguably, the UK index should have done better given the showing from its commodity stocks. BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 1% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $62.50 for the first time in 2 years following an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanti-corruption\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blitz from Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with investors barrelling into the commodity as they weighed up the potentially destabilising effect this will have on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil output. Copper also got a boost this Monday, surging 1.2% as the markets got to grips with the idea that the metal will see a sharp increase in demand as electric vehicles becomoe more popular. This in turn led the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miners higher, with Riot Tinto up 1.7%, Anglo American up 2% and BHP Billiton up 2.7%. After a quiet trading session, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has nudged up to a new all-time closing high. The blue-chip index gained just two points today, having also hit a closing high on Friday. However, the picture is less rosy when you adjust for the weaker pound..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the latest drop in UK car sales, for those just tuning in: New car sales have declined for the seventh month in a row, falling more than 12% in October as worsening confidence among consumers and businesses continues to dampen the market. The figures show that the car market is on course for its first annual decline since 2011 and will continue to fall next year before stabilising in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The industry body said car registrations dropped 12.2% year-on-year to 158,192 last month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second double-digit decline this year. It is an acceleration from the 9.3% fall in car sales in September, the first time the market had declined in September in six years. In April, sales plummeted 19.8% after an increase in vehicle excise duty. Diesel sales tumbled by nearly 30% last month after the scandal over rigging emissions tests and political rumblings over restrictions on diesel cars. Demand for electric and hybrid cars continued to rise, up by nearly 37% to 8,244, while petrol models posted a small increase of 2.7%. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market, but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low-emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Labour MP Chuka Umunna MP has warned that the drop in UK car sales shows that Brexit is hurting the economy. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet more evidence that the Brexit squeeze is already hitting working people and businesses alike. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c directly caused by the Brexit vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has forced up prices and interest rates, deterring people from buying big-ticket items like cars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British people were promised that leaving the EU would make us better off, when in truth it is hitting growth, raising prices, and squeezing family budgets. Voters have the right to keep an open mind about our future when they see that the darkening reality is so far away from the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunny rhetoric.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US stock market has opened for trading after a silence for the victims of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Texas church shooting... ..... and the Nasdaq index has hit yet another record high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to Broadcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by over 4%, while Broadcom are up 2%. There are reports that Qualcomm will reject Broadcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances, which is pitched at a 28% premium to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. After hitting a two-year high this morning, Brent crude still up - and trading at $62.30 per barrel. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the shake-up and crackdown in Saudi Arabia is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind Brent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Last week the Saudi Arabian oil minister said that he supported another Opec production cut, set to be announced when Opec next meets later this month. This weekend an anti-corruption drive by Prime Mohammad bin Salman has seen the arrest of the well-known champion of capitalism Prime Alwaleed bin Talal among other officials and has rattled investors, stock exchanges across the Middle East have fallen at the start of this week. However, this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt the oil price as yet. The reason that Brent has rallied even when other Saudi-based assets have struggled, could be two-fold: the extension of the Opec production cut is a powerful driver of oil in the short term, and Brent could be acting as a safe haven in the midst of the confusion around the anti-corruption drive and Prime Mohammad bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shifting economic agenda.

The DAX and the CAC 40 saw fresh record highs last week, while the FTSE 100 hit a multi-month high, so a small pullback today is hardly surprising. Over in America, the New York Federal Reserve has confirmed that its president, William Dudley, is retiring early next year. That means more upheaval at the US Federal Reserve, just a few days after Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chair next year. The drop in the value of the pound since the 2016 EU referendum is an important factor in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falling car sales. So argues Ana Nicholls, Automotive Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a question of drooping consumer confidence - the economics of the car market have also changed in the past few months. With the pound so low, carmakers can no longer afford to use the kind of discounting and offers they have been using to keep the market buoyant. The diesel market, meanwhile, has been hit by the threat of regulation and higher levies in the wake of the emissions scandal. She adds that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise (the first in a decade) will also dampen demand for new cars. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the market, either, given that 86% of all cars are bought on credit - many of them on personal contract plans. Total car loans now stand at nearly \u00c2\u00a360bn. Although credit will remain cheap in historic terms, lenders will be forced to pass on the interest rate rise sooner or later. Sales of vans in the UK have also fallen sharply, mirroring the slump in car sales last month. The SMMT reports that light commercial vehicle sales fell by 7.4% last month; another sign that British businesses are suffering a drop in confidence. Sales of smaller vans (lighter than two tonnes) suffered a sharp decline, tumbling by 20% compared to October 2016 SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political and economic uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has dented business confidence, discouraging firms from splashing out on a new vehicle. Newsflash from America: Semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom has launched a $130bn takeover bid to take control of smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm. If the deal goes though, it could be the biggest technology takeover ever, says the Financial Times. Both companies are major players in the market for wireless communications chips for mobile phones. Combining them would create the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel and Samsung, according to Bloomberg. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is now addressing the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference. On Brexit, he says the UK needs to agree a transition deal soon. Delaying a transition deal until the final Brexit deal has been agreed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Corbyn (something BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gavin Patterson presumably agrees with). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging the speech in his Politics Live blog: The chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, has warned the government that it only has a couple of months to agree a transitional Brexit deal, before firms start to vote with their feet. Patterson says companies will start enacting their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit plans from the start of next year, when the value of a transitional deal to leave the EU begins to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deteriorate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for firms. Speaking at the CBI conference in London he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Clarity on transitional arrangements] That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very urgent at this moment. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll all start planning and implementing a hard Brexit scenario which is not going to be very good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked when the value of a transitional deal becomes of less use, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The beginning of next calendar year it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to begin to deteriorate in value. Ultimately the planning horizon, of most businesses I certainly talk to, is the order of a year to 18 months. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have certainty at that point you have to start planning for a worst case scenario.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the City, shares in car dealership Inchcape have fallen by 2.7% this morning, to the lowest level since mid-July. Traders seem to be reacting to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak UK car sales figures, say analysts at MorningStar: Simon Benson of AA Cars says the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on older \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirty diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cars is having a major impact - with sales down 30% year on year in October. Benson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite registrations of alternatively fuelled vehicles rising and a slight uplift in sales of petrol cars, the overall market was down by more than 12% last month as these efforts failed to balance out diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the widespread uncertainty and general confusion surrounding diesels and the potential for charges and restrictions in London and other major cities, a distinct lack of buyer confidence is the primary reason for this dramatic drop. Back in July, the government outlined plans to ban new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040, as part of a crackdown on air pollution. Industry figures have hoped that consumers would move to Euro 6 diesels (which heat Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new, tougher emission standards). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, though, suggests that many are shunning diesels, amid signs that the second-hand value of older diesels has slumped. Back in the eurozone, optimism among investors has hit its highest level in a decade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Sentix, the research group. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone investor confidence gauge soared to 34 this month, up from 29.7 in October . That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck). Sentix also found that investor sentiment towards Germany has hit an all-time high, following its strong growth this year (as highlighted by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory orders figures). Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons the decline in UK car sales shows that the Bank of England was wrong to raise UK interest rates last week. Alex Buttle of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that diesel car sales have slumped by 30% year-on-year. He blames the emissions scandal, in which manufacturers used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheat software\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to hide how much pollution they were creating. With Paris planning to ban diesels by 2024, consumers seem to be voting with their wallets. Buttle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures make depressing reading for the car industry. Petrol and alternative fuel figures were actually up in October, but diesel sales continue to flounder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share is plummeting and consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listening to rhetoric about cleaner diesel models, however much the industry drums on about it. The damage has been done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable the SMMT is not deserting diesel and urging the government to act to reassure consumers that new diesel cars will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from toxin tax punishment, is this a lost cause? Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time focus is shifted towards giving attractive tax incentives for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles to encourage growth in this area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers are showing huge interest in eco-friendly cars and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflected in new registrations. AFVs are the future of the car industry and the government need to adapt to changing times if it has any interest in keeping the new car market buoyant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The outlook for UK car sales looks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bleak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He says that the 12.2% slump in October is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alarming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and shows that consumers are very reluctant to make financial commitments at present. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, from 0.25% to 0.5%, could also hurt demand, he fears. Tombs writes: Worryingly, sales are falling rapidly even though generous discounts are available for buyers trading in old, high-polluting diesel vehicles. Most manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 diesel scrappage schemes are set to close at the end of this year. The recent further decline in consumer confidence, meanwhile, indicates that car registrations will continue to fall well into 2018. The downward trend likely will be amplified by increases in personal loan rates in response to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Rate hike. Accordingly, the outlook for car sales looks bleak. This chart highlights how sharply UK car sales have declined this year: Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at the Unite union, blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchaos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 around Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union: The fall in UK car sales has accelerated over the last three months, making October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year-on-year decline the biggest since April: January: +2.9% February: -0.3% March: +8.4% April: -19.8% May: -8.5% June: -4.8% July: -9.3% August: -6.4% September: -9.3% October: - 12.2% (because of monthly fluctuations, UK car sales are compared to the same month a year ago). Although diesel sales slumped, Britons actually bought more electric cars in October. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 36.9% year-on-year, with 8,244 new models registered during the month. That pushed sales of AFV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s through the 100,000 mark, up from around 75,000 a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! UK car sales declined by 12.2% in October, as the slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry continues. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153falling confidence among buyers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the slump that began in April continues. Car sales to businesses shrank by 26.8%, suggesting that firms are cutting back on their spending. Sales to individual private buyers shrank by 10%, in a sign that customers are more cautious in the face of rising inflation and falling wages. Diesel sales took a particular hit, shrinking by almost 30%, while petrol sales rose a little. Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures: UK new car market declines again in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down -12.2% to 158,192 units. Heavy losses for diesel as demand falls by almost a third, with -29.9% fewer registrations. Year to date registrations decrease -4.6%. This means that UK car sales have fallen by 4.6% in 2017, compared to 2016, with 2,224,603 cars registered since January. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, wants the government to reassure people that diesel has a future: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK. We urge the Government to use the forthcoming Autumn Budget to restore stability to the market, encouraging the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles as fleet renewal is the fastest and most effective way of addressing air quality concerns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every weekday morning, Business Today delivers the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics direct to your inbox.

The French private sector grew at its fastest pace in over six years in October, according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. Service sector firms and manufacturers both reported that activity was strong, pulling the French \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up to 57.4 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Germany companies also posted solid growth - although not quite as fast as in September. The German composite PMI dropped to 56.7, from 57.7. Italy, though, came off the boil, with the slowest rise in service sector growth since last autumn. The oil price has hit a two-year high this morning. Brent crude is changing hands at $62.50 per barrel, up 0.7%, which may lead to higher fuel and energy prices this winter. This follows the news that eleven Saudi princes have been arrested as part of a sweeping purge, which seems to strengthen crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This is significant for the energy market, as prince Mohammed supports extending the current output curbs agreed by the Opec cartel. Edward Bell, an analyst at Emirates Nbd Bank Pjsc, explains (via Boomberg): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producers and exporters undergoes a transformation of its economy, some uncertainty and political risk is bound to be encountered along the way, which would be supportive for prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has beaten expectations again. German factory orders rose by 1% in September, surprising economists who expected them to fall by 1.5%. This was driven by a jump in orders for capital goods - expensive machinery and equipment. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already sparkling data has also been revised up, to show a 4.1% jump in orders - up from a previous estimate of 3.6%. It suggests that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to grow strongly. 2017 is turning into the strongest year for the eurozone since the financial crisis struck. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski is impressed.... .. as is Fred Ducrozet of Pictet bank. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales figures come at a nervous time for the auto industry. Last month, car dealership chain Pendragon shocked the City with an unexpected profits warning which sent its shares careering to a four-year low. Car makers are also worrying about Brexit, as they currently benefit from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the single market and the customs union. Production across the industry has fallen for the last five months, with new investment on hold until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Vauxhall is already planning to swing the axe, with 400 jobs going at its site in Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has struggled in 2017, with sales falling steadily since April. New figures released today will show that the slump continued last month. Sales are expected to have fallen by around 12% year-on-year in October, following a 9% decline in September. Such a steep decline will surely fuel worries over the UK economy and consumer confidence. Diesel cars sales are likely to have tumbled particularly sharply, due to the fallout from the recent emissions scandal. The official figures are due at 9am, but preliminary data has already been released, as Reuters explains: British new car sales in October fell by about 12 percent year on year, marking a seventh consecutive month of decline, preliminary data released by an industry body showed on Monday. Sales were hurt by a decline in business and consumer confidence, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders(SMMT) said. Demand for diesel cars slumped by about 30 percent, the industry body said. The SMMT urged the government to use this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn budget to restore stability to the market and encourage the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles. Also coming up today: Data firm Markit will release a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service companies. Growth probably held up well in October, with the headline PMI expected to remain at 54.9. European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, with the FTSE 100 called down 13 points from Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing high. Plus, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business chiefs are gathering in London for the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from prime minister Theresa May and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Corbyn. Expect lots of talk about Brexit...

However, the taxi app company could appeal again.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Charles</strong>, consulting barrister at <strong>Crossland Employment Solicitors, </strong>argues that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gig economy faces a major shake-up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where previously they had been treated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-employed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and denied access to any employment rights.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century:</p> <p><strong>Sam Dumitriu, </strong>the <strong>ASI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s</strong> Head of Projects, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even existed.

<p><strong>My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning.</strong></p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ride-hailing firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling</a> could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision.</p> <p>Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed.</p> <p>Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal flexibility they value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The Independent Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights.</p> <p>Aslam said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Farrar said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/10/uber-loses-appeal-employment-rights-workers\">Uber loses appeal in UK employment rights case</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:47:33.578Z\">at 1.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059be4c0cdb10716cc118e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:57:27.825Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Expert: Uber can't have its cake and eat it</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers.</strong></p> <p>Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply declare that workers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if the evidence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back it up.<br></p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service.</p> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:49:26.018Z\">at 1.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059ce5c0cdb10716cc11a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:37:02.225Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model.</strong></p> <p>She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too.</p> <p>Brown explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProbably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the start of October, despite this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better-than-expected trade figures.

David Madden of CMC Markets says: European equity markets are in the red today as traders feel uneasy about being long going into the weekend in light on the sharp correction yesterday. The rapid move lower yesterday got traders thinking about how much markets have come in recent months, and that prompted some profit taking. And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Some late news before the weekend; US consumers have become a little gloomier. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly gauge of morale fell to 97.8 in October, a big fall from September. Time for a quick recap. Uber drivers are celebrating after the company failed to overturn a ruling that they are actually workers, not self-employed contractors. Lawyers say it is a landmark ruling, that means Uber faces liabilities for national minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. However, the taxi app company could appeal again. Kevin Charles, consulting barrister at Crossland Employment Solicitors, argues that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gig economy faces a major shake-up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where previously they had been treated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-employed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and denied access to any employment rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century: Sam Dumitriu, the ASI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Projects, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news from the UK, including... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a rise in exports to the EU. Manufacturing output has jumped, as firms benefit from the weaker pound and global economic growth But construction output shrank sharply as firms refuse to commit to new offices and factories UK GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months, a little faster than before Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth rate rose to 0.5% in the last three months, according to a new report. NIESR, the think tank, estimates that the UK growth rate picked up last month. That pushed growth in the August-October period up to 0.5%, they believe, from 0.4% in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2017, suggesting the economy is recovering from its early slowdown. Amit Kara, Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, says: Although economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. NIESR also predict that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 2% by 2021 My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take: The ride-hailing firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed. The landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision. Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed. Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central London, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal flexibility they value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Independent Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights. Aslam said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farrar said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers. Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply declare that workers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if the evidence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back it up. He explains: Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model. She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too. Brown explains: With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProbably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed. If they are workers though, they may be exposed to a significant NIC liability. There may also be a substantial VAT liability.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Frank Field MP, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge success for workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He adds: [Labour MP] Rachel Reeves and I will next week be proposing to our select committees a draft bill which would make these individual, but important, skirmishes a thing of the past as legislation would protect all workers in similar situations.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Oxford law professor Jeremias Prassl is tweeting the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling: UK law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which represented Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drivers, are understandably delighted to have won today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling. They argue that it is a critical moment in ending exploitation of workers in the gig economy. Paul Jennings, partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite, sums up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are delighted with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgment which is ethically and legally the right outcome. The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We anticipate that tens of thousands drivers will now seek to make substantial back-dated claims. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uber could continue its battle, by appealing to the court of appeal or even the supreme court. Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde &amp; Co, warns that this will mean more uncertainty for UK companies and workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The final outcome of this case will provide employers with much needed clarity in this area. But uncertainty is likely to linger until the supreme court has and possibly beyond that, if the government commits to legislative changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cloud of uncertainty looming over the gig economy has undoubtedly made new businesses in the UK cautious about building a business model around a self-employed ad-hoc workforce, which may be further stagnating growth and therefore damaging the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is particularly concerning as the Brexit clock keeps on ticking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK needs to ensure it is demonstrating that it is open for business and at the very least showing business that there is legal clarity around alternative employment practices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jamie Jenkins, barrister at St John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Buildings, predicts that Uber will appeal again. Ruth Kennedy, barrister at 2 Temple Gardens, tweets: Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst, believes Judge Eady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has massive consequences for other companies, as well as Uber. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implications of this appeal decision reach far beyond the price of a taxi journey home. Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model for its workforce has again been found to be fatally flawed; the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drivers are in fact workers entitled to basic rights such as holiday and sick pay. This decision has re-opened a can of worms which will have a ripple effect on the financial viability of the gig economy in its current form and beyond that into mainstream industries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unions are urging Uber to accept today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153throw in the towel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, rather than continuing its fight. TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady said: No company, however big or well connected, is above the law. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This ruling should put gig economy employers on notice. Unions will expose nasty schemes that try and cheat workers out of the minimum wage and holiday pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sham self-employment exploits people and scams the taxman. The Uber drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union GMB deserve huge credit for their work on this case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can read the full ruling in the Uber case, here. In it, her honour Judge Eady QC explains that the Employment Tribunal was correct to conclude that an Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on, was within London, and willing and able to accept assignments was working for Uber London Ltd (ULL) under a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contract. As she puts it: If the reality is that Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share in London is such that its drivers are, in practical terms, unable to hold themselves out as available to any other PHV operator, then, as a matter of fact, they are working at ULL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disposal as part of the pool of drivers it requires to be available within the territory at any one time. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling confirms that Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drivers in the UK are entitled to various workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another victory for the two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who argued successfully that they and fellow drivers were effectively employees. The ruling has significant ramifications for the gig economy, and firms whose business model is based on flexible working patterns. Legal firm Leigh Day say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a landmark ruling. Newsflash: Uber has lost its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are actually workers. An employment tribunal in London has backed the original ruling, last year, that Uber drivers are not self-employed. More to follow.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry, though, had a bad September. Construction output slumped by 1.6% during the month, the biggest fall since March 2016. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures indicate the shadow of Brexit still looms large over the industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum causing imported building materials costs to rise, while company and UK investors caution is holding back investment in new projects, so many contractors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 margins are shrinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commercial and industrial sectors that rely on ambitious multi-million pound construction projects are the hardest hit, and only new builds in the private house sector, propped up by the likes of Help to Buy loans, are offering any glimmer of hope at the moment. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, points out that the construction sector is now in recession: Yael Selfin, chief economist at HSBC UK, reckons UK exporters should be doing better... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may finally be benefitting from stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound, says James Smith of ING. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged by the jump in manufacturing growth in September, saying: One of the big \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stories of 2017 is the global pick-up in growth. That, along with the weaker pound, has seen UK manufacturing sentiment rise noticeably. But for much of this year, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it by looking at the production numbers. But a sharp 0.7% month-on-month rise in production during September, following some better readings over the summer, suggests these positive drivers may finally be being reflected in higher output Capital Economics have stripped out oil and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 factors from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK trade figures to show how the underlying picture is improving. Despite September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent figures, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total trade deficit actually widened over the last quarter to \u00c2\u00a39.5bn. More good news! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories were running full steam ahead in September. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% over the month, easily beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. A stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance benefited the broader measure of industrial production, which also beat forecasts with a 0.7% increase according to the ONS data. The figures mean that the production sectors - which include mining and utilities as well as manufacturing - made a stronger contribution to the economy in the third quarter than previously thought, growing by 1.1% between July and September. A rise in factory activity over the three months was largely driven by the production of cars and medical equipment, the ONS said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official explanation of how Britain grew its exports to the EU in the last quarter: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00c2\u00a31.7 billion (3.8%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. As shown in Figure 2, this was due to decreases in exports of fuels (\u00c2\u00a31.6 billion) and chemicals (\u00c2\u00a31.0 billion), which offset increases in exports to non-EU countries of other commodities over the same period. Exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00c2\u00a30.9 billion (2.2%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. The main contributor was increases in exports of transport equipment (predominately cars), which increased by \u00c2\u00a30.7 billion. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has narrowed by \u00c2\u00a3700m, partly due to a rise in exports to European countries. The gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to \u00c2\u00a32.75bn in September, a better result than expected. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has been revised lower, too, to \u00c2\u00a33.45bn. The Office for National Statistics says the improvement is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 primarily due to increased exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The trade in goods deficit is also better than expected, coming in at \u00c2\u00a311.2bn. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dire figure has been upgraded to \u00c2\u00a312.3bn, not the \u00c2\u00a314.25bn initially reported. The report also shows that the UK exported \u00c2\u00a3900m more goods to European countries in the three months to September, but sold \u00c2\u00a31.7bn LESS to non-EU countries. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries increased, by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn and \u00c2\u00a31.5bn respectively over the last quarter. The ONS says: The increase in imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and fuels from non-EU countries represents the largest increase in import commodities, alongside increases of mechanical and electrical machinery, material manufactures and fuel imports from EU countries. German business leaders have weighed in on the tricky issue of Brexit, warning that time is running out to agree a comprehensive deal between the two sides. Reuters has the details: The European Union and Britain will not be able to reach a comprehensive deal on their future economic relations by the March 29, 2019, exit deadline, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest industry group BDI warned on Friday, adding that a hard Brexit was very likely. The two sides will need many years to complete a comprehensive deal on trade and investments, BDI managing director Joachim Lang told Reuters. The comments come ahead of showdown talks between prime minister Theresa May and business leaders from the UK and Europe, on Monday. UK and EU negotiators are due to wrap up the latest round of talks in Brussels later today. The latest rumour is that Northern Ireland could remain inside the European customs union and single market after Brexit. This would avoid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hard border on the island of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, reports the Financial Times. It offers the intriguing prospect that City banks could move operations to Belfast rather than, say, Frankfurt to retain passporting rights in the EU.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dank, grotty morning in the City of London, as traders await today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures. The FTSE 100 is bobbing around the 7485 mark, up one meagre point. The French CAC and German DAX are equally subdued, as the markets slope towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is hoping that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data will provide some intrigue. The FTSE has struggled in the last couple of days, with a volatile commodity sector and a flagging set of retail stocks dragging the UK index back below 7500. As for the pound, while its seen some progress in recovering last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Bank of England losses, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still nowhere near its pre-hike highs. Against the dollar sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wrong side of $1.315, while against the euro the currency is straining to keep its ahead above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see whether the latest manufacturing and industrial production figures can make anything better a bit later. The former is forecast to fall from 0.4% to 0.3% month-on-month, while the latter is expected to nudge higher, from 0.2% to 0.3%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the goods trade balance reading, with analysts estimating the deficit to have shrunk from \u00c2\u00a314.2bn in August to \u00c2\u00a312.9bn in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deficit problem -- the gap between what Britain buys from the rest of the world, and what it sells back. New trade figures due out today may show that the UK managed to narrow this gap, a little. Economists predict that the trade deficit dropped to around \u00c2\u00a34.5bn in September, from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointingly large \u00c2\u00a35.6bn. That would be a welcome sign, but frankly the broad picture is that Britain is still struggling to rebalance its economy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been no sign, yet, that the weak pound is boosting exports. In August, the trade in goods deficit expanded to an alarming \u00c2\u00a314.2bn -- dwarfing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus in service. This goods deficit is expected to drop to \u00c2\u00a312.8bn in September - still a yawning gap in historical terms. In a flurry of data, the Office for National Statistics will also publish new UK industrial production figure. UK manufacturing output is expected to have grown by 0.3% in September, down from 0.4% in August. Then at lunchtime the National Institute of Economic and Social Research will estimate how fast the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew between August and October. We know that the UK grew by 0.4% in July to September, so these figures will show if growth slowed last month. Also coming up today... World stock markets seem a little edgy today after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Some traders blame uncertainty over US tax \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans, amid complaints that the richest Americans will benefit the most. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: President Donald Trump and corporate America may not be satisfied with the revised Senate Republican tax plan. The dollar and global equities received a hit on news that Republican senators are likely to delay the introduction of corporate tax cuts until 2019. The reaction in markets wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise, given that investors have been pricing in a lot of good news and further pullback may continue for a couple of days or weeks, as many stocks look overbought at the moment. The Senate wants to maintain the seven tax brackets, rather than the four proposed by the house. They also want to tax foreign profits held by offshore U.S. companies at a different rate. However, the timing of the corporate tax cuts will likely determine how markets move for the remainder of 2017. Meanwhile in London, Uber will discover whether its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are employees has been successful. And finally (as they say on the TV news), John Lewis are launching their Christmas advert, starring a large and cuddly creature named Moz who lives under the bed. A damning indictment of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing crisis, no doubt, but can he match the success of Monty the Penguin?....

Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears.</p> <p>What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month.</p> <p>With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to rate movements.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year.</p> <p>Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago.</p> <p>This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018.</p> <p>There was some equally good news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter.</p> <p>All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c522402d23606ce8c99d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T14:53:50.088Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales rise, as consumer prices edge up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter</p> <p>An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials.

Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest gain witnessed in three months.</p> <p>Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar.</p> <p>Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively.

                "bodyText":"Continuing strength in the euro, a falling oil price and a decline in US markets, have combined to pull most European shares lower. On Wall Street, worries about a Chinese slowdown and concerns over the Republicans successfully implementing their tax plans were additional negative factors. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 41.81 points or 0.56% at a five week low of 7372.61 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.44% to 12,976.37 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.27% at 5301.25 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.62% to 22,158.88 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bucked the trend, up 0.24% at 10,013.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.19% to 718.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 87 points or 0.38%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Markets may be lower but could be supported at these levels. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: Stocks are falling, volatility is on the up, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth appears to be weakening and we even have a military coup to deal with. On the face of it, the situation would be ripe for a big selloff in equity markets, but this is not 2008 or even 2015. Below the surface some sectors, such as utilities, are recovering, while in the UK and Europe markets are off their lows. It is options expiration week, and a look at positioning through put/call ratios suggests sentiment has become excessively bearish. Plus, Thanksgiving is on the horizon, and the week before this all-American holiday tends to be a good one. The bears can almost taste victory, but I suspect that 2017 will work its magic once again and the dip buyers will have their way. The concerns about a rise in US crude stocks last week proved well founded. They climbed by 1.85m barrels compared to earlier forecasts of a 2.2m drop. Gasoline stocks rose by 894,000 barrels as opposed to the expected 0.9m decline. Oil prices remained in the doldrums after report but at least recovered from their lows, with West Texas Intermediate now doen 0.46% at $55.24 a barrel. US markets remain in negative territory although the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down 131 points or 0.5%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets looked pretty bloody this Wednesday, with the euro once again the only real winner. With US investors already fretting about the Republican tax reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push them through after they failed so spectacularly on healthcare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a weak pair of inflation and retail sales readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do much to help matters. The former came in as expected at a measly 0.1% in October, down from 0.5% in September, while the latter arrived at a better than forecast, but still miserly, 0.2%. Neither figure substantially threatens a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve; however, the tendrils of doubt are never too far away, meaning the US markets could have done with something more robust to drive away the current gloom. Instead the Dow Jones is stuck with a 130 point fall, taking the index to a sub-23300, near 4-week nadir. The dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better; while it held flat against the pound, largely due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation and wage growth issues, it shed 0.1% against the euro and 0.4% against the yen. Things were just as glum in Europe. The FTSE is down around 50 points thanks to its commodity stocks, and is trading at its worst price since the end of September, while the DAX, displeased at the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience, has shed nearly 120 points to hit a fresh 6 and a half week low. Back in the UK, and sales of used cars fell over the summer, according to the industry body. Julia Kollewe writes: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said today that the used car market declined for a second quarter, with sales down 2.1% between July and September from a year ago. About 2.1m secondhand cars changed hands. Superminis are still popular, making up a third of sales. Along with SUVs they were the only categories to show growth. Silver remains the most popular used car colour, closely followed by black. Sales of hybrid and electric cars rose 17% to 25,196 units (electric cars alone urged 66.4%). While petrol sales fell 6.5%, demand for diesels rose 4.2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in stark contrast to new diesels where sales have fallen sharply. After a bumper first quarter the market remains at record levels, with more than 6.3m buyers opting for a used car in the first nine months of this year, up 0.1% on the same period last year. Simon Benson, director of motoring services at used car website AA Cars, said:\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales of used cars have suffered - but not nearly at the same rate as the new car market, which experienced a double digit decline last month. A lack of consumer confidence has rippled out across the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retail sales and inflation figures are likely to add more fuel to the fire in terms of a US rate rise next month, analysts believe. But there is some uncertainty as to the future trend of borrowing costs, especially with a new Fed chair for the new year and a change in the composition of the decision making panel. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears. What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month. With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to rate movements. ING economist James Smith said: A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year. Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago. This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018. There was some equally good news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter. All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year. Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials. Economists had forecast no change. Meanwhile the September figure was revised upwards from 1.6% to 1.9%. On the inflation front, consumer prices edged up 0.1% in October as a boost to oil prices from the hurricane-related disruptions to the Gulf Coast fell away. In September, the consumer price index had climbed 0.5%. The data - the inflation figures in particular - was seen as negative for the dollar. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest gain witnessed in three months. Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar. Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively. A solid breakout back above 94.50 threatens the current bearish setup. US markets are on the slide again, hit by a falling oil price and continuing worries about the ability of the Republicans to achieve their proposed tax cuts. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.9% at $55.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency issued a gloomy outlook on the prospects for global demand for oil. Later come the latest US crude inventory figures, with investors worried they might show an increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 155 points or 0.66% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.58%. Back in London, a Bank of England deputy governor has insisted that wages should rise in 2018 as low unemployment forces bosses to pay more for labour. Obviously there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much sign of this happening yet, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lacklustre wage growth. But Ben Broadbent insists that reports of the death of the Phillips Curve (the classic inverse relationship between unemployment and pay) were exaggerated. Broadbent told an audience in London that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Several commentators have questioned the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central prediction that wage growth will rise next year. Some have gone further and pronounced the death of the Phillips curve. There are always risks to any forecast. But the latter claim, at least, is premature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadbent also blamed the tumble in the pound after the EU referendum for pushing down real wages, as the weak currency made imports pricier and thus pushed inflation up. Breaking away from UK unemployment briefly, there are three important developments in Greece. First, the Greek government has launched a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn debt swap, asking investors to hand over existing bonds in return for new debt. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to ease Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 return to the financial markets after years of bailouts. These new bonds won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mature for many years, sparing Greece any nervy repayment deadlines. But secondly, ratings agency DBRS has warned that Greece is unlikely to make much progress in its current bailout talks this year. Thirdly, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftist-led government has taken further steps to relax capital controls that were imposed to stop its banks collapsing during the crisis two years ago. Helena Smith reports from Athens The Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative of impending exit from seemingly perpetual crisis took a knock today as the Toronto-based rating agency said it was unlikely that Athens would complete crucial bailout talks before the end of the year. In a note the ratings service reckoned a compliance review with international auditors representing creditors keeping Greece afloat would not be completed until 2018. Wrapping up the review was key to unlocking debt relief talks and discussions on the type of support Greece would receive once its current bailout programme ended in August next year Meanwhile, the leftist-led coalition took another step Wednesday towards easing capital controls imposed to prevent a run on banks at the height of the debt crisis. A degree that went into effect today, foresees depositors being able to fully withdraw sums in bank accounts transferred from overseas as of December 1st. People who have not previously held bank accounts will also be able to open one under the new regulations signed by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and published in the government gazette. Despite what the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted (see earlier) UK unemployment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually a record low. The current jobless rate of just 4.3% is the lowest since 1975; in early 1974 it was just 3.6%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless total of 1.42 million also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a record - it was lower in 2004 and 2005. Thanks to economics professor Danny Blanchflower for flagging this up. In another significant development, The Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust has warned an extra 42,000 young people dropped out of the labour market and the education sector in the last three months. This group became economically inactive, and were not in education or training either - a worrying sign. Joe Levenson, communications and campaigns director at the Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust, says the jump highlights the challenge facing young adults - particularly mothers with young children. Levenson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u015342,000 more young people are now economically inactive and out of education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a dramatic increase on the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women in particular are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by a lack of convenient childcare and support. While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, 343,000 young women who are not included in the numbers are being left jobless and forgotten. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the same time, we have a youth debt epidemic, which is only set to worsen as prices rise and wages remain low. It can be especially hard for young mums; in many cases, an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s childcare can cost more than an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Much more needs to be done to improve young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available, and extended the National Living Wage to under-25s, so they are paid the same amount for the same work. This will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how the number of young adults who have left the labour force has risen, while those in work or looking for work has dropped: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has just welcomed the drop in unemployment and the rise in productivity seen today. (I suspect this tweet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come directly from the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thumbs; it would be very disrespectful to tweet during Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions - as Hammond is sat next to Theresa May on the front bench) The number of people from other EU countries working in Britain has hit a record high, up by 112,000 in the last year. That takes the total number of EU nationals to 2.38m. There are also 28.55m UK nationals in work (up 183,000 in the last year), and 1.21 million non-EU workers (down by 23,000). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key chart: My colleague Alan Travis has examined the data, and writes: The figures from the Office of National Statistics show that the number of Polish and other east European nationals working in Britain has dropped for the first time in more than 10 years, down from 1,054,000 in the summer of 2016 to 1,035,000. The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has, however, continued to rise, from from 257,000 to 347,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 90,000 increase that accounts for the majority of the overall increase in the last year. More here: With wages lagging inflation, struggling families may be forced to hit their credit cards hard this Christmas. Positive Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director Fran Boait hopes that Philip Hammond can help next week - especially as the Bank of England has raised the cost of borrowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As real pay continues to fall, households are being forced to borrow ever-greater amounts to make ends meet. The economy is being kept afloat on the back of families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit cards, at increasingly high interest rates. In the budget later this month, the Chancellor must act to boost investment and deliver a sustainable boost to incomes, before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a rates rise - now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a pay rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Resolution Foundation, the UK think tank, fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market is losing momentum. They are concerned by the drop in employment over the summer, as it could show the labour market is plateauing. The persistent failure of wages to rise when workers have been in shorter supply is another worry. They say: The biggest pay squeeze is taking place in other service sectors (-2.7%), public administration (-2.2%) and real estate (-1.9%), while pay growth is strongest in agriculture (+3.9%) and in support services (+0.8%). Stephen Clarke, Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic analyst, expects real wages to keep falling for the next few months. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After years of impressive growth, there are signs that the labour market may be losing momentum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The still strong picture on employment still refuses to have any meaningful impact on wage growth, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay squeeze is getting deeper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome productivity figures offer a glimmer of hope on pay, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to say whether it can grow into a meaningful recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Resolution have also produced some charts to explain the pay squeeze: Amid the real wage gloom, there is an encouraging sign..... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to have become more productive. The ONS estimates that productivity per hour grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first increase since the end of 2016, and is the highest rate of growth since Quarter 2 2011. This could be a crucial factor in getting wages up -- as bosses have been blaming weak productivity for the meagre pay increases doled out to their staff. David Willett, Corporate Director at The Open University, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcencouraging development\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For too long the UK has been lagging behind, with a lack of higher skills limiting the agility and adaptability needed to drive organisations forward. Stagnant productivity is a significant barrier to growth at an uncertain time when we need to ensure the stability of our economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Organisations now need to keep this up. With technology advancing at a rapid rate, and businesses looking to automate where they can, low-skilled jobs are increasingly under threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial that organisations invest in training their staff to build up essential technical and soft skills to future-proof them against changes in the political, economic and technological environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for everyone in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister for employment, Damian Hinds, has hailed the drop in UK unemployment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strength of the economy is driving an increase in full-time, permanent jobs and a near-record number of people are now in work thanks to the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When unemployment fell to 5% early last year, many people thought it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much lower, and yet it now stands at 4.3%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut income tax for 30 million people since 2010, meaning people keep more of their money each month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the labour market looks quite different if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the opposition front bench. Debbie Abrahams MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, points out that the cost of living squeeze hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stats are further evidence of Tory economic failure, only a week out from their next Budget. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over seven million people live in poverty in working households. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour will introduce a \u00c2\u00a310 an hour real Living Wage, scrap the public sector pay cap and reform the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failing Universal Credit programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain is now suffering its second wage squeeze since the financial crisis, as this chart from the FT shows: How can unemployment and employment both have fallen, I hear you cry. The answer is that the number of adults classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomically inactive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has gone up. That means more people have simply dropped out of the labour market altogether. Geraint Johnes, Research Director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour market statistics show unemployment continuing to fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by some 59000 between the second and third quarters of this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.3%. The most recent fall, however, is due largely to a large increase in the number of people deemed economically inactive. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key chart, showing how the number of economically inactive people in Britain rose by 151,000 in the last quarter. That will include students, people stopping work to care for a family member, or look after young children, or just giving up the search for a job altogether. Professor Johnes has also spotted that more people are only working part-time: Meanwhile, part-time employment has risen, with an increase of 18000 part-time employees and 45000 part-time self-employed. Inasmuch as it continues a trend towards greater casualisation and insecurity in the labour market, this should be noted as a cause for concern. Overall the level of employment has fallen. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing wage squeeze is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge body blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to consumers as they try to make ends meet in the run-up to Christmas, says Maike Currie of Fidelity International She fears that real wage growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elusive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for some time: With a number of factors keeping a lid on our earnings - from people working flat out in the gig economy yet still struggling with paltry pay, more and more people in self-employment, falling unionisation, automation and technology substituting man for machine, this is unlikely to change any time soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nick Macpherson, formerly the top civil servant at the Treasury, fears that the UK labour market is cooling.... Here are some charts showing the state of the UK labour market: This chart from the Office for National Statistics shows how wage growth has struggled to get much above 2% this year. And that means that real wages are falling, whether or not you include bonuses: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in nominal terms (that is, not adjusted for price inflation) increased by 2.2% both including and excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.5% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. The pound has risen slightly, as City traders welcome the pick-up in wage growth in the last quarter. Breaking! The number of people in employment across the UK has fallen, for the first time in nearly a year. There were 32.06 million people in work in July-September, which is a 14,000 drop on the previous quarter. This is the first drop since August-October 2016, and the biggest decline since April-June 2015. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 75.0%, down slightly compared with April to June 2017 but up from 74.4% for a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at a 42-year low of just 4.3%. Unemployment fell by 59,000 between July and September to 1.42 million, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 182,000 less than a year earlier. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages squeeze continued to bite in the last quarter, according to the latest Labour Market report just released. Basic pay rose by just 2.2% per year in July-September, meaning that wages continued to lag inflation. Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.2%. In contrast, inflation was 2.7% in August, rising to 3% in September and October. More to follow... Britain has rediscovered its taste for Angel Delight! Sales of the retro desert are up 30%, in a boost for Premier Foods. Angel Delight first hit the shelves in the late 60s, when UK cuisine was more basic.... Overnight, Japan has posted its seventh consecutive quarter of growth, the longest run in over a decade. Japanese GDP rose by 0.3% during the July-September, with rising exports making up for weaker domestic demand. This will be welcomed by Tokyo as it tries to put Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost decades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind it, and achieve steady growth and inflation. But it also means Japan will be one of the slower-growing G7 nations in the third quarter; Germany grew by 0.8%, America by 0.75%, France and Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by 0.4%. All eyes on Canada.... On a nominal basis (not discounting for inflation), Japanese growth was 0.6%. This chart, from manufacturing group EEF, shows how UK wages have fallen below inflation (the dotted line) this year: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report will paint a picture of an economy suffering from subdued wage growth, but enjoying record low unemployment. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the pound could suffer if the wage figures are particularly bad. He writes: Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is at a 42-year low, the buzzkill remains, that little sign of rising pay growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. If average earnings struggle to pick up, consumers are likely to continue feeling the squeeze, especially when considering how inflation remains at a five-and-a-half year high, at 3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real wage squeeze is set to deepen today, when we get new data showing how the UK labour market is performing. Economists predict that basic pay (excluding bonuses) grew by around 2.2% per annum in the July-September quarter, up from 2.1% a month ago. Any increase would be welcome, but this would still leave wages lagging behind inflation - which ran at a five-year high of 3% in September and October. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada warn that UK wages will remain subdued for several months, but might then rise faster. With the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Regional Agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey indicating pay settlements could pick up next year to 2.5-3.5% next year, it could well be some way into 2018 before there is sufficient evidence from the labour market reports that pay growth is making a meaningful advance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report may also show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate stuck at just 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. In theory, such a tight labour market ought to drive wages higher as bosses compete to recruit workers. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: With unemployment at 42 year lows of 4.3%, it surely can only be a matter of time before wage pressure starts to manifest itself further..... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already started to see increasing evidence that wages at the lower end of the income scale are rising at rates faster than inflation as the effects of increases in the minimum and living wage help pull up wages at the bottom of the pay scales. This should inevitably see a trickle up effect as earners higher up the income scale start to demand higher wages in a tightening labour market,. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning ahead of the jobs report, which is released at 9.30am.
