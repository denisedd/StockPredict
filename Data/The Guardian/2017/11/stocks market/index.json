On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned.</p> <p>Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event.</p> <p>When it comes to the statement, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388507310a25bc6ad9c6fe5d863520f7f716ee5d/0_0_2000_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Powell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Powell<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year.

                "bodyText":"Commenting on the Fed decision, Kully Samra, UK managing director of Charles Schwab, said: A widely expected move from the Fed with market consensus anticipating one further rate hike in December. A more aggressive Fed could have posed a problem for equities, but for now the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s methodical approach to monetary policy tightening is reassuring investors and ensuring the continuation of the bull run. The Fed has an important balancing act to play as it slowly continues to normalise monetary policy by gradually lifting interest rates and unwinding its bloated balance sheet. We expect earnings season to propel stocks to further gains. However, signs of inflation and the potential of a melt-up do pose some risks. The US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook is also bolstered by broadly strengthening global economic growth and the continued rise in global earnings may support further stock market gains. So on Thursday we are due to get the perhaps more important Fed news - Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick for the next chair of the US central bank. Also coming up is the Bank of England rate decision, which is widely expected to see the first rise for a decade. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One key point from the Fed statement. It says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In September it said economic activity \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been rising moderately so far this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slightly more positive comment adds to the idea of a rate rise in December. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a comparison of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed statement with the September comments: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. And the comments about changes in rates are unchanged from the September meeting: In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Breaking News: The Federal Reserve has kept US interest rates on hold, as expected, but left open the prospect of an increase at its December meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING from earlier today on the Fed: The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate decision is due in less than an hour, and while no change is expected this time round, analysts will be looking for clues as to whether a rise is nailed on for December. Given the relatively strong economic data recently, this seems fairly probable, but the observers will be looking out for clues from the nuances of the accompanying statement. In some ways the Fed decision is not the most important event for the US central bank this week. On Thursday Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the new Fed chair, with the dovish Jerome Powell said to be the frontrunner to replace Janet Yellen. Although Yellen herself may not be completely out of the picture, the choice of Powell would suggest to investors that the Fed is likely to continue on its present course of gradual interest rate rises as the economic conditions dictate. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision would typically be one of, if not the most important event of the week but that may not be the case today. For one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely that any change in interest rates will be announced, with December remaining far more likely for the final hike of the year. With Chair Janet Yellen not making an appearance after the announcement, we instead have to rely on the accompanying statement for clues as to whether another hike in December is still planned. Moreover, with Donald Trump poised to announce who will succeed Yellen from February on Thursday, investors may take the statement with a pinch of salt when considering interest rates beyond the end of the year. All things considered, not only is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement not the biggest market event this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to even be the most important Fed event. When it comes to the statement, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the central bank to deviate much, if at all, from previous rhetoric as the data has been broadly consistent with expectations, barring the understandable weak jobs report last month. This Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is expected to be much better than normal which should mostly offset the weakness in job creation in September, something the Fed may allude to. Josh Mahony, market analyst at IG Group, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will no doubt fall on the Fed, with the penultimate FOMC meeting of the year happening just a day before Trump announces his pick for the Fed chair. With markets widely expecting to see Trump opt for Jerome Powell, there is no doubt that Janet Yellen will want to deliver the three rate hikes that were initially set out in the dot plot at the turn of the year. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting may not bring the kind of volatility and excitement of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England announcement, today is a key determinant of market expectations as we seek to narrow down exactly how likely a rate hike is for December. Stefan Gerlach, chief economist at EPG Bank and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, looks at the potential candidates for the Fed chair: The first is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed Governor since 2012, and who is seen as the favourite. Prior to that he was Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. Before that he was a lawyer and investment banker in New York. The second candidate often mentioned is John Taylor, who was Treasury Under-Secretary for International Affairs, 2001- 2005, and who developed the Taylor Rule, discussed below, as a means of describing the way in which the Fed sets interest rates. While these two candidates are the current favourites, it is of course possible that somebody else will be appointed, or that Chair Yellen will be reappointed. As US investors await the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision, most European markets have ended the first day of the new month on a positive note. Buoyed by weakness in the euro after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, French, German and Italian markets have closed in positive territory, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax in particular playing catch up after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public holiday. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex, however, has edged lower on profit taking after its recent gains, which were prompted by fading fears about the Catalan independence demands. The FTSE 100 slipped back despite a positive performance from the mining sector after Chinese manufacturing data. Next proved a drag on the index after its badly received results, and helped pull other retailers lower as well. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher ahead of the Fed news. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 5.12 points or 0.07% to 7487.96 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.78% to 13,465.51 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.2% at 5514.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.87% at 22,991.99 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.16% at 10,506.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.02% to 767.07 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently up 49 points or 0.21%. The main focus for US investors is the Federal Reserve meeting later - widely expected to keep rates on hold but hit at an increase in December - and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick for the next Fed chair. Meanwhile the US economic data continues to be strong. As well as the reasonable manufacturing data, there were also some positive jobs numbers, ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official non-farm payroll numbers. The monthly ADP report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, better than the 200,000 figures analysts had been expecting. It was also much better than September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 110,000 figure, albeit this was revised down from the initial estimate of a 135,000 increase. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was a pretty strong afternoon for US data. The ADP non-farm employment change reading hit 235k, sharply higher than last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 110k, to set up a potentially massive \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcofficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 number on Friday, while the final Markit manufacturing PMI for October came in a tad higher than forecast at 54.6. Only the ISM manufacturing figure disappointed, and even then, at 58.7, it was a more than respectable number. The dollar was the main beneficiary of all this (the Dow Jones lost roughly a third of its early gains, though after rising 100 points it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at a fresh all time high). The greenback reversed its initial losses against the pound to climb 0.1%-0.2%, sending cable back below $1.33, while against the euro it jumped 0.2%. This reaction was assumedly related to the hawkish-tinge of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, with investors hoping the Federal Reserve tees up a December rate hike with this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Estate agent Jones Lang LaSalle has just published its latest forecasts for UK house price growth in the next five years. It has pencilled in an average of 2.5% growth a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from an average of 6.9% in the last 20 years. The firm is predicting a big shift to a more stable housing market with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more moderate UK house price growth over the next five to ten years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - despite Brexit. Growth is expected to average just 1% next year but then pick up to 2% in 2019, 2.5% in 2020, 3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022. Transactions are also set to slow, averaging 1.23m a year over the next five years. The firm said: Brexit will not get in the way of a more stable and healthy UK housing market. In central London we expect demand for new developments to remain muted but steady over the next two years until the Brexit road becomes clearer. A bedrock of demand will continue from domestic owner-occupiers supported by a steady stream of international buyers and investors. Activity in prime central London will be subdued for the next two years with continued pressure on pricing especially at the top end of the market where stamp duty impacts are greatest. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector continues to be rattled by Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are certainly out of fashion, down 8.5% right now at the bottom of the FTSE 100 losers column. Other retailers are sharing the gloom; Marks &amp; Spencer have lost 4%, Dixons Carphone have lost 2%, and Ocado are down 1.9%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d all be vulnerable to a slowdown in consumer spending (which might accelerate if the Bank of England raises interest rates tomorrow). Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors are worried that Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street sales slumped by 7.7% over the last quarter. These results are a reflection of the wider issues facing the retail sector. Investors continue to face challenges to their spending power as well as the structural shift to online shopping. Moreover, the vagaries of the British weather have only proved to be a hindrance. We have in general been fairly pessimistic towards the retail sector and nothing has really changed that sentiment. Over in Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has announced that Athens is likely to make at least four market forays before its current bailout programme expires next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a late night interview, the Oxford-educated finance minister confirmed reports that Greece was poised to tap bond markets again saying the foray was a purposeful move to improve the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt profile. He told the state new channel ERT-1 that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue is to have access to markets when we exit the programme,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a bid to prepare the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and make Greek bonds more attractive - Athens plans at least four market forays in the run up to August 2018 when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn euro aid programme officially ends. To boost liquidity the government is considering swapping twenty bonds issued in 2012 after a restructuring of Greek debt held by private investors for four or five new bonds. Hinting that a test run was imminent, Tskakalotos said investors would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand [Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] return\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to bond markets before international auditors representing creditors at the EU and IMF, wrap up a third compliance review as part of the bailout programme. The review is expected to be completed by January after inspectors return to the country at the end of November. Once concluded, Greece will start negotiating the terms of its exit from international supervision. At 180 % of GDP, Greece has the highest debt load in the EU. There are also reports that a senior EU official in Brussels has suggested that debt relief could be linked to further reforms once the current bailout programme ends. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector appears to be in good health, says Michael Pierce of Capital Economics. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing data: The small drop back in the ISM Manufacturing Index in October from a 13-year high is little to worry about, and still suggests that manufacturing output will rebound in the fourth quarter. The drop back in the headline index, from 60.8 to 58.7, took it back almost exactly in line with its value in August. Perversely, some of the decline in the index this month reflects an unwinding of hurricane effects. The disruption to supply chains caused delivery times to surge in September (interpreted in the ISM index as a positive sign of stronger demand), which was partly reversed last month. ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival US manufacturing survey is also out, and it suggests growth slowed but remained very strong: Breaking: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is expanding at its fastest rate since January. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US manufacturing PMI rose to 54.6 in October, up from 53.1 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortably over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. US factory bosses also reported that they took on more staff last month, at the fastest pace in over two years. This comes hot on the heels of some other strong jobs data today, showing that US firms hired staff at the fastest rate in 18 months. Wall Street traders have held a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence as a mark of respect for those who were killed in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truck attack in New York. Trading is now underway, and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have both hit new record highs as the market rally continues. Labour MP Wes Streeting says the government must heed the warning that 75,000 City jobs could be lost through Brexit, and avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure from the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that British companies are already preparing to shift jobs abroad as a result of Brexit. Our economy is being damaged now, with growth slowing and prices rising, and the situation is set to get worse as a hard and destructive Brexit gets closer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only by keeping Britain in the Single Market can the Government reassure financial services firms and stem job losses. But they have made an ideological choice to wrench our country out of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were told that Brexit would not lead to job losses. As people see the harm that is being done to our economy, they have every right to keep on open mind on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the House of Lords, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe has warned that the regulation of financial clearing houses could suffer after Brexit. These clearing houses sit between investors, settling trades, and (hopefully) avoiding financial contagion breaking out. European officials argue that they should supervise euro clearing (much of which takes place in London today). But Cunliffe fears this would lead to disruption. He told the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to make sure you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up with multiple hands on the steering wheel and multiple feet on the brake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BoE is also concerned that huge numbers of cross-border derivative contracts and insurance policies would be disrupted by Brexit. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there could be no agreement on how these derivatives contracts are regulated. Deputy governor Sam Woods says negotiators need to find a solution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By far the best fix would be for something to be included in the withdrawal bill. There would have to be bilateral agreement to fix this on both sides.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite fears over Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on Anglo-Irish trade, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer exports to the UK are up by 12%, it emerged today. Enterprise Ireland said the export of Irish consumer goods and services is now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m. The Irish government business agency puts a lot of the rise in exports to Britain down to better use of online sales and other innovations. Allyson Stephen, market advisor at Enterprise Ireland said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a crowded market such as Britain, knowing your market is essential before targeting buyers and while there are similarities between Irish and British consumers, in a business context there are vital differences, such as continuous and new and developing routes to market which must be recognised. Back in the City, Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares ares still down over 7% after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing sales update. That, by my maths, wipes \u00c2\u00a3540m off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation, from \u00c2\u00a37.17bn to around \u00c2\u00a36.6bn. That makes Next the worst performing stock on the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies). My colleague Angela Monaghan explains what went wrong: Investors took fright on Thursday after Next reported a fall in high street sales and warned trading was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of its crucial Christmas selling period. Next shares fell by 8%, making it the biggest loser on the FTSE 100, after the clothing retailer said sales at its shops fell by 7.7% in the three months to 29 October. Thanks to a 13.2% increase in Directory sales, including online, total sales for full-price items rose by 1.3% over the quarter. However, some analysts had been expecting total sales growth of more than 4%. More here: Another deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, tells the Lords committee that City firms will assume a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario on Brexit, unless they can see what the final \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcend framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a deal will be. Simply agreeing a transition period, with no clarity about what the final agreement might be, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough..... Over at the House of Lords, Sam Woods, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has told peers that 10,000 City jobs could be lost on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit. Testifying to the Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, Woods also says that the BoE believes it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plausible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that up to 75,000 roles could go in the long-term, as consultancy Oliver Wyman has estimated. Woods, who runs the regulatory arm of the Bank, has already asked 400 banks and financial firms for their contingency plans in the event of a hard Brexit. He said that some of those plans were already being put in place - reserving school places, hiring office space etc - but that plans would be put in place in earnest in the first quarter of the year. You can watch the session online here. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news highlights the dilemma facing the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers, as they try to decide whether to raise interest rates tomorrow. On one side, they have one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailers reporting weak, volatile sales - a sign that consumers are vulnerable and cutting back. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to leave borrowing costs unchanged. On the other, they can see Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories growing steadily, with production rising and - perhaps crucially for the BoE - price pressures rising. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to raise borrowing costs towards more normal levels, probably bolstering the pound and pulling inflation down. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out at noon on Thursday whether the Monetary Policy Committee has voted for its first interest rate rise in a decade.... Importantly, UK factories which produce consumer goods are lagging behind the rest of the sector, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. Markit says: Intermediate and investment goods producers both saw rising production volumes backed up by strong and accelerated intakes of new business. Conditions seemed less firm in the consumer goods category, however, as growth of new orders eased to a seven-month low and business optimism to its weakest level in the year-to-date. The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers grew at a faster pace in October has cheered industry experts and City economists. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see the manufacturing sector holding strong and steady in October, buoyed up by an increase in new orders from the domestic market and improving on last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. While trade from export markets slowed slightly, orders from overseas continued to rise for the 18th month supported by a robust global economy. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuating performance may have had some bearing on the softening in export orders, but there were continuing good levels of demand from Europe and the USA so no cause for concern. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK manufacturing sector has recorded another month well above the magic 50 mark that signifies growth and continues to perform well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the ongoing Brexit negotiations are causing uncertainty, recent CBI data shows orders and outputs are above historic levels, and similar trends are seen in exporting data. Firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans for investment in innovation remain strong, as does spending on training and development. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Month after month, manufacturing continues to hold its own delivering growth levels that keep the sector in positive territory. Although demand from both home and overseas markets remains robust, manufacturers will have half an eye on what the MPC decides to do tomorrow and the potential impact an interest rate rise would have on sterling. They will also be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement and what that may bring by way of a boost for the sector and I suspect many will be looking for R&amp;D tax credits to feature and encourage a much needed increase in investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister will be pleased to see an above-expectations hike in manufacturing output in October, particularly after a bigger than expected fall the month prior. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153British business is still trying to balance Brexit uncertainty against a weak currency-led boost to exports, but with the sterling creeping upwards of late, foreign demand may not hold for long. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say whether UK industry is out the woods just yet, with pressure on the sector likely to persist until more political clarity is found both domestically and on the continent. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While UK exports have increased in recent months, levels have yet to reach the heights that the devalued Sterling and strengthening economic performance in the Eurozone and global markets promised. Clearly, British manufacturers are prioritising profit margins over exports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of visibility over the future direction of Brexit negotiations is holding back major investment initiatives in the sector that might have boosted productivity. Without a clearer picture to support those decisions, there are concerns that UK manufacturing will fall behind in the global technology race and struggle to compete. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Input costs continue to weigh down on margins and a possible uptick in the interest rate from the Bank of England will add further pressure. Businesses will need to be vigilant of a potential rise in financial risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK manufacturing PMI report has pushed the pound over $1.33 for the first time in two weeks. Breaking! UK factories grew faster than expected last month, thanks to a surge in new orders. Data firm Markit reports that manufacturing output and new order growth remained robust in October, suggesting that the weak pound is helping factories. However, the fall in sterling is also pushing up the cost of raw materials, and finished products too. Markit says: The UK manufacturing sector started the final quarter of the year on a solid footing. Production and new order volumes continued to rise at robust rates, as companies benefited from strong domestic market conditions and rising inflows of new export business. Price pressures remained elevated, however, with rates of inflation in input costs and output charges both accelerating and staying well above historical series averages. This rise in output pushed the UK manufacturing PMI up to 56.3, which shows stronger growth. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading has been revised higher too. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturing made an impressive start to the final quarter of 2017 as increased inflows of new work encouraged firms to ramp up production once again. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says the 7.7% slide in Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street sales over the last quarter is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsickening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He writes: If such a distinguished guru as Simon Wolfson of Next finds it impossible to read the underlying sales trends, because of the volatility of the weather, then what are we mere mortals to do?... Some people in the City expected full-price sales to be nearly 4.5% up in Q3, driven by Next Directory, but the outcome was only +1.3%, with Next Retail down a sickening 7.7% and Next Directory up 13.2% Global Data retail analyst Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien wonders whether Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online ordering system can help: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBC reporter Clodagh Rice: The stock market can be cruel at times. So says George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third quarter performance is actually better than what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen from the group so far this year, but with many expecting a much stronger showing, the shares still took a tumble. While the recent investment in digital marketing seems to have helped the Directory division rediscover its mojo, Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street stores saw an almighty slump this quarter. A particularly weak October means the group enters the all-important Christmas period with less momentum than it would have liked. Salmon add that other retailers could be nervous too... Shareholders in Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, might now be a bit more nervous ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year numbers. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly, ugly morning for Next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says recent positive noises from the company have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come back to haunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures have punctured the optimism that had built up recently. Campbell adds: While Q3 total sales grew 1.3%, an improvement on the 2.2% decline seen in the first half of the year, that was lower than the 2.9% growth expected as the firm warned on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sector landscape. Similarly, though Directory sales rocketed 13.2% higher, retail (i.e. high street) sales plunged a far worse than estimated 7.7%, leading Next to revise its annual pre-tax profit forecasts from \u00c2\u00a3687m-\u00c2\u00a3747m to \u00c2\u00a3692m-\u00c2\u00a3742m. None of these were particularly bad figures; but the expectation created by the past few updates meant these Q3 results couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but disappoint, causing the stock to sink 7.5% to a 7 week nadir. Shares in Next have tumbled by almost 8% at the start of trading. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 368p at \u00c2\u00a345.52. That confirms that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are weaker than the City expected. Other retailers are also suffering, with Marks &amp; Spencer down 3.7% and Associated British Foods (which owns Primark) down 2.5%. UK high street retailer Next has spooked the City by missing its sales forecasts and warning that trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Next, one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key retailers, has reported that sales at its stores shrank by 7.7% in the three months to 29th October. Although directory sales (including online) rose by 13.2%, this means Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total full-price sales only increased by 1.3% over the quarter. Some analysts had expected growth of 4%, so this is a new signal that the UK high street could be weakening. Recent warm weather has hurt clothing retailers, as it has discouraged shoppers from splashing out on a new winter coat. Next says: Sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather. In August and September sales were significantly up on last year, as cooler temperatures improved sales of warmer weight stock. The change in sales trend came at precisely the same time UK temperatures became warmer than last year. But there are also signs that rising inflation, which is outstripping wage growth, is hurting shoppers. Next admits that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on out there: Week by week sales volatility makes it very hard to determine any underlying sales trend. We believe the most reliable guide to sales for the balance of the year are the full price sales for the year to date, which are down -0.3%. Despite the sales slowdown, Next is hoping to make pre-tax profits of \u00c2\u00a3692m to \u00c2\u00a3742m for this financial year. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK manufacturing has a surprisingly good summer, expanding by 1% during the third quarter of 2017 (according to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report). Today we discover whether it maintained that momentum in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because data firm Markit are releasing their latest purchasing managers reports, showing how factories around the world fared last month. Economists predict a solid reading from the UK, with its manufacturing PMI tipped to remain unchanged at 55.9. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities believe the numbers could move the pound: Earlier in the day investors will want to pay attention to the Manufacturing PMI release from the UK which comes a day before tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting on monetary policy. The pound has gained considerably over the past two days as expectations are set for the BoE to hike rates this month and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI release could set the stage for more gains. Royal Bank of Canada say: There was a loss of momentum generally last month in many of the activity sub-components of these surveys but the manufacturing sector is looking the most buoyant. Alas, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until tomorrow to find how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories performed. Nationwide, the estate agent, has reported that house prices rose by 0.2% last month (more on that shortly).

The (arguably more important) wage growth reading also came in worse than forecast, plunging from 0.5% to 0.0% month-on-month. Yet any disappointment was tempered by the unemployment rate, which fell to a 17 year low of 4.1%. Elsewhere an underperforming Markit services PMI, which arrived at 55.3 against the initial 55.9 estimate, was countered by a stellar ISM number, at 60.1 against the 59.8 forecast.</p> <p>After a bit of a wobble post-jobs report that ISM services PMI seemed to swing things in favour of the dollar, which rose 0.4% against the euro and 0.3% against the yen. Only against the pound did the greenback struggle, and even then it held onto almost all of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty gains. As for the Dow Jones, the index was pretty flat after the bell, though is still at a 23500-plus all-time high following Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q4-inspired rise.</p> <p>Though the pound couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any great inroads against the dollar, rising just 0.1%, against the euro it had more successful, climbing half a percent to re-cross \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125. This helped erase the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early growth, meaning the UK index may struggle to close at the record high it was promising during the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T15:56:40.571Z\">at 3.56pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59fc8998cf32fa0718a9efd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T15:23:53.187Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was more US data this afternoon, with better than expected factory goods orders.</p> <p>They rose by 1.4% in September, up from 1.2% in August and higher than the 1.3% increase forecast by economists.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc84bb9e4e3b0684a494be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T15:01:29.035Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the prospect of another Fed rate hike:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jmoz62/status/926455112943505408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well there&#39;s a thought...courtesy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bloomberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bloomberg</a> H/T <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@zerohedge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L9RAGSThbe\">pic.twitter.com/L9RAGSThbe</a></p>&mdash; David Morrison (@jmoz62) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmoz62/status/926455112943505408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc7ee2cf32fa0718a9ef38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T14:41:00.520Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the Markit service sector survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services PMI survey highlights the dilemma facing the Fed as it seeks to determine the right policy course amid signs of solid growth but soft inflation.</p> <p>Together with the manufacturing PMI, which rose higher in October as hurricane-related supply chain disruptions eased, the latest services survey is consistent with underlying growth in the economy of approximately 3%, as well as buoyant jobs growth. </p> <p>With the data for October setting the scene for another robust GDP increase in the fourth quarter, a December rate hike is very much on the cards. </p> <p>However, a drop in inflationary pressures adds an element of uncertainty to the picture.

Barring an economically damaging government shutdown in early December we expect the Fed to hike rates on December 13 with at least two further rate rises probable under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc6656e1f1970691236054\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T12:51:47.236Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the full jobs report:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BLS_gov/status/926426246581547008\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Payroll employment rises by 261,000 in October; unemployment rate edges down to 4.1% <a href=\"https://t.co/NsuHovcqn0\">https://t.co/NsuHovcqn0</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JobsReport?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JobsReport</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLSdata?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BLSdata</a></p>&mdash; BLS-Labor Statistics (@BLS_gov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLS_gov/status/926426246581547008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc65a2e1f197069123603d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T12:50:32.066Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sector breakdown for the jobs data:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7b3b29a7553e2d0ea9523228991ce0018c00b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b3b29a7553e2d0ea9523228991ce0018c00b9b/0_0_1576_786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"moreusnonfarm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc6489e1f197069123602c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T12:46:44.669Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of the hurricane related fall in September, notably in the leisure sector, seems to have been reversed in October.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 may have hit a closing high after a day of dithering, but it was a more mixed picture elsewhere. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax also hit a new closing peak, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac also closed higher. But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex fell back, on news that members of the deposed Catalan government were being jailed. US markets moved higher following the widely watched non-farm payroll figures and bumper results from Apple. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.03 points or 0.07% at a new record close of 7560.35 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.28% to 13,478.86 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5517.97 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.14% to 23,014.13 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.96% at 10,357.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.14% to 763.56 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 38 points or 0.16%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index has hit a new closing high - just. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.07% at 7560.35, beating the previous record of 7556.24 set on 12 October. But it is still well below the intra-day high of 7598. In a day when the index drifted from positive to negative and back again, the rise has been driven by the pound losing much of its early gains against the dollar. A weak sterling helps the many overseas earners in the index. It may be a quieter week on the corporate and economic front but markets could still press on to yet more record high, reckons Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Although the [US] jobs report fell short of the lofty forecasts made earlier in the week, the solid rebound from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number, plus strong revisions to previous two months, meant that the overall impression of a healthy US economy remains intact, and thus leaves us still expecting the Fed to raise rates once more this year. After the relentless nature of the newsflow of the past few days, investors seem to have taken the afternoon off, with some judicious profit-taking to round off the week. Sterling valiantly tried to claw its way off the lows hit yesterday, after the swan-dive following the BoE news, but despite Ben Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best efforts to say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno, we really do want to keep raising rates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the deputy governor failed to dispel the impression that the MPC will now sit on its hands and await developments. With over 80% of the S&amp;P 500 having reported, and 77% of them having beaten estimates, we are now into the scrag-end of earnings season. Overall the period has been firmly supportive of equity prices, even at their current elevated levels. With the coming week seeing a notable downturn in big-ticket corporate and economic events, equities will just have to get by on bullish momentum alone. On the evidence of the past year though, this should be enough to send them to new record highs. It was a mixed day for US data, with the dollar finally deciding it was all broadly positive, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: While the headline non-farm figure rocketed higher from the hurricane-hit (but upwards revised) 18k in September to 261k in October, that was markedly lower than the blockbuster 312k expected by analysts. The (arguably more important) wage growth reading also came in worse than forecast, plunging from 0.5% to 0.0% month-on-month. Yet any disappointment was tempered by the unemployment rate, which fell to a 17 year low of 4.1%. Elsewhere an underperforming Markit services PMI, which arrived at 55.3 against the initial 55.9 estimate, was countered by a stellar ISM number, at 60.1 against the 59.8 forecast. After a bit of a wobble post-jobs report that ISM services PMI seemed to swing things in favour of the dollar, which rose 0.4% against the euro and 0.3% against the yen. Only against the pound did the greenback struggle, and even then it held onto almost all of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty gains. As for the Dow Jones, the index was pretty flat after the bell, though is still at a 23500-plus all-time high following Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q4-inspired rise. Though the pound couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any great inroads against the dollar, rising just 0.1%, against the euro it had more successful, climbing half a percent to re-cross \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125. This helped erase the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early growth, meaning the UK index may struggle to close at the record high it was promising during the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. There was more US data this afternoon, with better than expected factory goods orders. They rose by 1.4% in September, up from 1.2% in August and higher than the 1.3% increase forecast by economists. On the prospect of another Fed rate hike: On the Markit service sector survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The services PMI survey highlights the dilemma facing the Fed as it seeks to determine the right policy course amid signs of solid growth but soft inflation. Together with the manufacturing PMI, which rose higher in October as hurricane-related supply chain disruptions eased, the latest services survey is consistent with underlying growth in the economy of approximately 3%, as well as buoyant jobs growth. With the data for October setting the scene for another robust GDP increase in the fourth quarter, a December rate hike is very much on the cards. However, a drop in inflationary pressures adds an element of uncertainty to the picture. Having been buoyed by supply chain disruptions in prior months, input cost pressures eased at the start of the fourth quarter, and the rate of increase of average prices charged for goods and services dropped markedly. While the Fed may likely tilt towards hiking in December on the back of robust economic growth, much may depend on the data flow in coming weeks for signs that stronger growth is feeding through to higher prices. If the US jobs data presented a rather mixed package, the latest surveys of the service sector are no more clear cut. The ISM non-manufacturing index for October came in at a better than expected 60.1, up from 59.8 in the previous month and higher than the forecast figure of 58.5. This is the highest level since August 2005 and the 94th consecutive month of growth. And here are some of the comments from the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respondents: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Increasing commodity pricing along with rising construction cost is a concern in [the] quarter ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is strong, driven by large upticks in business from clients in the retail industry. Seasonal surge is starting out stronger than in a normal year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current hurricane damage will result in a shortage of some building materials and draw labor forces away from our area.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Positive trends continue. Business activity/results good. Revenue and net profit are above plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to struggle with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunknowns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 around Obamacare, and its impacts on our health care and insurance businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business activity with oil companies remains flat. Oil field services, midstream, downstream and petrochemical sectors remain strong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business levels increased due to hurricane recovery efforts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Real Estate, Rental &amp; Leasing) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Outlook is favorable. Labor is in short supply and is constraining growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Wholesale Trade) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uptick based on replacement vehicle activity in hurricane-impacted areas of Texas and Florida.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Retail Trade) But earlier, the rival Markit services PMI was a lower than expected 55.3, down from an initial estimate of 55.9 and the same level as in September. US markets are off to a positive start. Investors took a positive view of the jobs numbers, while Apple also helped after its positive results and upbeat comments on the iPhone X. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 23 points or 0.11% at a new record high, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.05% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%. As for Apple, its shares are up around 3% in early dealings. The pound continues to hold onto its gains after the better than expected service sector data: However the dollar continues its recovery against other currencies: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the view from Danske Bank on the non-farm numbers: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the jobs figures: The US economy bounced back in October from a dramatic slump in hiring in the wake of two devastating hurricanes, the labor department announced on Friday. The US added 261,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%. In September the US shed 30,000 jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first loss in seven years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as hurricanes Harvey and Irma held back hiring in Texas and Florida. The leisure and hospitality industry was hardest hit by the hurricanes in September, shedding 111,000 jobs. Employment in food services and drinking places rose sharply in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 89,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c following a decrease of 98,000 in September. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was still lower than analysts had expected, perhaps reflecting the continued impact of the storms. September was the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. The labor department had calculated that the US had added 169,000 new positions in August, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. But the figures from August and September have now been revised up, to 208,000 and 18,000 respectively. And at 4.1% the unemployment rate is now at lows unseen since December 2000. Wage growth, which has been slow since the recession, stalled in October. Average hourly earnings fell by one cent in October to $26.53 an hour. Economists had expected a slight monthly gain. More here: The dollar has recovered from its initial falls in the wake of the jobs data, with traders coming round to the view that a December rate rise is still on the cards. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital: The dollar fell and Treasuries rose after the monthly US jobs report missed expectations and wages failed to grow by as much as anticipated. The dollar index dropped half a percent before coming back to pare losses. Having sunk below 113.70 on the release from above 114.10, at send time USDJPY was steadying around 113.90. EURUSD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains have all but been erased and, at just below 1.1670, euro-dollar is almost flat for the day. Bit of a kneejerk on the misses for jobs and wages but sentiment seems to be recovering pretty swiftly as it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the Fed hiking in December. Markets still see a greater than 90% chance the FOMC will raise rates at the next meeting. With tax reform now on the table we have to also assume that policymakers will start to factor that in to their projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something they have pointedly refused to do so far \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that could lift expectations for hikes in 2018. The strong US employment data but modest wage growth backs the idea of gradual Federal Reserve rate hikes, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: US employment has rebounded from hurricane related weakness, but wage growth is benign meaning the Fed trajectory on rate hikes remains on track. The US labour report for October has reversed the hurricane related distortions of the September release. Payrolls rose 261,000 versus the 313,000 consensus, but there were a net 90,000 upward revisions so on balance it is a strong report and backs the case for a December rate hike. If you remember, September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls fell 33,000 (now reported as an 18,000 rise) largely because a significant number of people in affected areas couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into work and therefore were not logged as being on the company payroll that day. This of course has unwound and on top of that we are seeing strong growth in the economy , which is creating jobs while post hurricane rebuilding and recovery work is likely to have added even more. The unemployment rate has surprisingly dropped a tenth of a percentage point and is now 4.1% - the lowest rate since December 2000. Average earnings growth has softened though, coming in flat on the month after a 0.5%MoM gain last month. This leaves pay at 2.4% YoY, which is a little disappointing. However, the fact that underemployment is now just 7.9% (down from 8.3% last month) really underlines how strong the jobs market is, meaning that the balance of risks must lie to the upside on wage growth from here. With the economy growing strongly and tax reform likely to add further fuel to the fire, the case for higher US interest rates continues to build. Barring an economically damaging government shutdown in early December we expect the Fed to hike rates on December 13 with at least two further rate rises probable under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the full jobs report: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sector breakdown for the jobs data: Some of the hurricane related fall in September, notably in the leisure sector, seems to have been reversed in October. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: Employment in food services and drinking places increased sharply, mostly offsetting a decline in September that largely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. In October, job gains also occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care. But Fidelity International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anna Stupnytska believes the jobs figures are troubling for the Fed: The jobs news has sent both sterling and the euro to their highs of the day against the US dollar. But slightly weaker than expected data is unlikely to deter the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December, analysts believe. Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said: A rise in non-farm payroll numbers indicates that the labour market has largely brushed off hurricane-induced issues, paving the way for the Fed to hike rates in December. While some data points missed the mark, the ADP Employment Change Report showed private sector payrolls rose by 235,000 jobs in October, proving that the job market remains in fairly healthy shape with a strong bounce back in hiring from the previous disappointing month. Alongside robust job growth, third quarter earnings have been solid so far and economic growth has picked up. Along with new records being set by stocks, investor sentiment measures are demonstrating widespread optimism and the US economy has received a boost from expectations that tax reform and earnings will continue to fuel an updraft in the markets. On the earnings front, average hourly earnings were unchanged after expectations of a 0.2% rise month on month. The year on year figure fell from 2.8% in September to 2.4%, lower than the forecast 2.7% rise. The October US jobs number may have disappointed, but figures for the previous two months have been revised upwards. September saw an 18,000 increase compared to the initial estimate of a fall of 33,000. The August number is up from 169,000 to 208,000. Breaking News: The US added 261,000 jobs in October, rebounding strongly from the surprise fall the previous month in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. This compares to expectations of a rise of around 310,000. The jobless rate fell from 4.2% to 4.1%, slightly better than forecasts. Meanwhile the pound is picking up after the strong service sector numbers gave more credence to further UK interest rate rises, despite the Bank of England playing this down on Thursday. Sterling is currently up 0.26% at $1.3091 against the dollar and 0.36% better against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1239. Conversely this has seen the FTSE 100 lose much of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains - the leading index is full of overseas earners which benefit from a weaker pound. The index is currently up just 0.02% at 7556.73 having earlier touched 7580. If it closes at this level it will still be a record high, but only just. The figure to beat is 7556.24. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The headline payrolls figure could be huge; analysts have forecast a reading of 312k, a colossal step up from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hurricane-hit -33k, and potentially the best number since the start of 2015. Elsewhere the jobs report isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to be quite as strong, with an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2% and a dip in wage growth from 0.5% to 0.2% month-on-month. The non-farm payrolls report is due at 12.30pm and is expected to show a strong rebound in jobs in October after major hurricane disruption triggered a sharp fall in September. Economists are expecting the report to show an additional 310,000 jobs were created, following a 33,000 drop a month earlier. Annual pay growth is expected to slip however, to 2.7% from 2.9%, with a monthly increase of 0.2% pencilled in, following 0.5% in September. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 4.2%. Fitch has said there will be no major economic impact from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise, and are not expecting another one in the next 12 months. Fitch has for some time been expecting the post-referendum interest rate cut to be reversed, although in our most recent global economic outlook (September 2017), we expected this to happen in early 2018. The MPC summary said that all members agreed that future increases \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues to provide significant support to jobs and activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We think another increase is unlikely in the next 12 months, given the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the outlook for investment. The decision does not alter our UK growth forecasts , which see a net trade boost partially offsetting slower domestic demand this year, enabling real GDP to rise by 1.5%, before slowing to 1.3% next year. But it remains to be seen how firms and households adjust to a shift in the monetary policy stance after such a long period without a rate rise. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says the Bank of England might not wait a year before raising rates again, as many currently expect. He says the PMIs suggest the economy is on track to grow 0.5% in the fourth quarter, which would be the strongest rate of quarterly growth this year. Clarke adds: I think yesterday taught us that the MPC and particularly the doves want to see concrete signs that wages are picking up before pulling the trigger again. Nonetheless, if we get the fall in unemployment that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m expecting, confirmation of 0.5% growth in Q4, and signs of faster wages early in the new year, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to be another year until the next hike. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the forecasting group, the EY ITEM Club, says the stronger-than-expected headline services PMI number (55.6) boost prospects for growth in the fourth quarter overall. The October services purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey showed activity improving significantly to a six-month high, thereby boosting fourth quarter growth hopes. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise marked the biggest monthly improvement in the index since August 2016. Overall, the October PMIs [including manufacturing and construction] suggest that the economy continued to improve gradually at the start of the fourth quarter after GDP growth improved modestly to 0.4% q/q in the third quarter from 0.3% in both the second and first quarters. Behind the headline number, the services PMI is a bit of a mixed bag. New business growth was the fastest since May, helped by more orders from the domestic market and successful new product launches according to the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respondents. Orders were also boosted in some cases by firms absorbing higher costs, rather than fully passing them on to customers. But jobs creation in the sector was the weakest in seven months, as companies became increasingly concerned about demand in the longer-term as a result of Brexit uncertainty. The sector accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy and includes restaurants and hotels, hairdressing, legal and accounting services, among other things Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, explains the mixed messages coming from the October PMI. The latest PMI surveys bring mixed news on the economy. While an upturn in business activity growth adds some justification to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, a deeper dive into the numbers highlights the fragility of the economy and points to downside risks for the outlook. A downturn in business optimism about the year ahead, fueled mainly by Brexit-related uncertainty, suggests that risks are tilted to the downside as far as future growth is concerned. Not surprisingly, employment growth slowed for a second successive month as the business mood grew more cautious and risk averse. Overall he says the services PMI - combined with equivalent surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors - suggests quarterly growth of 0.5%, marking a decent start to Q4. (The economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter.) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector growth accelerated unexpectedly last month according to the IHS Markit/CIPS PMI survey. The headline index combining output, orders and employment rose to a six-month high of 55.6 in October, from 53.6 in September. Any number above 50 signals expansion, and economists had predicted slightly weaker growth at 53.3. This will be welcomed by Bank of England policymakers as a positive for the economy, strengthening their argument that the economy was ready for yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise, despite falling real wages which is putting pressure on household finances. The FTSE 100 is up 23 points this morning at 7,578.50, putting it on course for a new closing high. The number to beat is 7,556.24. The index is benefitting from a weaker pound, because so many of the companies listed have significant earnings abroad. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is lagging the rest of Europe this morning, as political turmoil continues to weigh on investor sentiment. The scores so far this morning: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,578.50 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.4% at 13,497.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.01% at 5,509.95 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 23,080.45 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.7% at 10,382.90 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 395.5 Ben Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that the UK economy could withstand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a couple more rate rises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has done nothing to lift the pound. Having fallen 1.8 cents - or 1.3% - against the dollar on Thursday, to $1.3067, the pound has dipped further this morning to $1.3053. The fall suggests that as well as having already priced in the well trailed hike, markets are not convinced another one is coming any time soon. It has recovered some ground against the euro however, and is currently up 0.07% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1207. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank of England, has been elaborating this morning on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise rates for the first time in a decade. Commenting on the impact of the rise for UK households, he told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: There will be some [pain] and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one part of how monetary policy works. Equally one should keep this in context. Around a third of households have owner-occupied mortgages, interest payments on debt - in aggregate - for households, are lower than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever been, relative to income, and this is a moderate rise. One should also bear in mind there are people who derive income from deposits so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, but I think one should keep the scale of this in context. He added the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current view is that two more rate hikes will be needed to bring inflation back to the 2% target: Given our outlook currently, we anticipate we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need maybe a couple more rate rises to get inflation back on track, while at the same time supporting the economy. That is not a promise, and it never could be a promise. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was momentous day for the UK yesterday, with the first rise in interest rates in a decade. The benchmark cost of borrowing was increased to 0.5% from 0.25%, reversing the cut implemented by the Bank in August last year in response to the Brexit vote. Ben Broadbent has admitted this morning that the hike will inflict pain on some households - those with standard variable rate mortgages - at time when real incomes are falling. But he insisted the rise was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the economy could withstand a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153couple more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hikes in order to bring inflation back to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Also coming up: 9.30am: The UK services PMI for October is expected to show growth in the sector (which accounts for about three-quarters of the economy) was broadly stable last month. 12.30: US non-farm payrolls report for October will reveal how well the jobs market bounced after taking a mighty hit from hurricane disruption in September",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat graphic summing up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK car sales figures: And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Brent crude has now hit a 28-month high, at almost $64 per barrel, as the shockwaves from the Saudi \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorruption crackdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ripple through the oil market. The purge of Saudi princes and officials has sparked speculation that instability in Saudi Arabia could affect oil supplies in the future. Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, explained to Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The geopolitical supply risk premium is starting to bear its head in the market right now because OPEC supply cuts have made it relevant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loewen added that, with supply capped and demand rising, potential risks to supply become more significant. The drop in UK car sales didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter City traders from pushing the Footsie to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing high. Energy firms rose, tracking the oil price after Brent crude hit that two-year high this morning. Mining firms also had a good day, thanks to a pickup in the copper price. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Arguably, the UK index should have done better given the showing from its commodity stocks. BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 1% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $62.50 for the first time in 2 years following an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanti-corruption\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blitz from Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with investors barrelling into the commodity as they weighed up the potentially destabilising effect this will have on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil output. Copper also got a boost this Monday, surging 1.2% as the markets got to grips with the idea that the metal will see a sharp increase in demand as electric vehicles becomoe more popular. This in turn led the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miners higher, with Riot Tinto up 1.7%, Anglo American up 2% and BHP Billiton up 2.7%. After a quiet trading session, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has nudged up to a new all-time closing high. The blue-chip index gained just two points today, having also hit a closing high on Friday. However, the picture is less rosy when you adjust for the weaker pound..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the latest drop in UK car sales, for those just tuning in: New car sales have declined for the seventh month in a row, falling more than 12% in October as worsening confidence among consumers and businesses continues to dampen the market. The figures show that the car market is on course for its first annual decline since 2011 and will continue to fall next year before stabilising in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The industry body said car registrations dropped 12.2% year-on-year to 158,192 last month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second double-digit decline this year. It is an acceleration from the 9.3% fall in car sales in September, the first time the market had declined in September in six years. In April, sales plummeted 19.8% after an increase in vehicle excise duty. Diesel sales tumbled by nearly 30% last month after the scandal over rigging emissions tests and political rumblings over restrictions on diesel cars. Demand for electric and hybrid cars continued to rise, up by nearly 37% to 8,244, while petrol models posted a small increase of 2.7%. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market, but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low-emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Labour MP Chuka Umunna MP has warned that the drop in UK car sales shows that Brexit is hurting the economy. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet more evidence that the Brexit squeeze is already hitting working people and businesses alike. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c directly caused by the Brexit vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has forced up prices and interest rates, deterring people from buying big-ticket items like cars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British people were promised that leaving the EU would make us better off, when in truth it is hitting growth, raising prices, and squeezing family budgets. Voters have the right to keep an open mind about our future when they see that the darkening reality is so far away from the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunny rhetoric.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US stock market has opened for trading after a silence for the victims of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Texas church shooting... ..... and the Nasdaq index has hit yet another record high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to Broadcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by over 4%, while Broadcom are up 2%. There are reports that Qualcomm will reject Broadcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances, which is pitched at a 28% premium to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. After hitting a two-year high this morning, Brent crude still up - and trading at $62.30 per barrel. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the shake-up and crackdown in Saudi Arabia is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind Brent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Last week the Saudi Arabian oil minister said that he supported another Opec production cut, set to be announced when Opec next meets later this month. This weekend an anti-corruption drive by Prime Mohammad bin Salman has seen the arrest of the well-known champion of capitalism Prime Alwaleed bin Talal among other officials and has rattled investors, stock exchanges across the Middle East have fallen at the start of this week. However, this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt the oil price as yet. The reason that Brent has rallied even when other Saudi-based assets have struggled, could be two-fold: the extension of the Opec production cut is a powerful driver of oil in the short term, and Brent could be acting as a safe haven in the midst of the confusion around the anti-corruption drive and Prime Mohammad bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shifting economic agenda.

The DAX and the CAC 40 saw fresh record highs last week, while the FTSE 100 hit a multi-month high, so a small pullback today is hardly surprising. Over in America, the New York Federal Reserve has confirmed that its president, William Dudley, is retiring early next year. That means more upheaval at the US Federal Reserve, just a few days after Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chair next year. The drop in the value of the pound since the 2016 EU referendum is an important factor in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falling car sales. So argues Ana Nicholls, Automotive Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a question of drooping consumer confidence - the economics of the car market have also changed in the past few months. With the pound so low, carmakers can no longer afford to use the kind of discounting and offers they have been using to keep the market buoyant. The diesel market, meanwhile, has been hit by the threat of regulation and higher levies in the wake of the emissions scandal. She adds that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise (the first in a decade) will also dampen demand for new cars. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the market, either, given that 86% of all cars are bought on credit - many of them on personal contract plans. Total car loans now stand at nearly \u00c2\u00a360bn. Although credit will remain cheap in historic terms, lenders will be forced to pass on the interest rate rise sooner or later. Sales of vans in the UK have also fallen sharply, mirroring the slump in car sales last month. The SMMT reports that light commercial vehicle sales fell by 7.4% last month; another sign that British businesses are suffering a drop in confidence. Sales of smaller vans (lighter than two tonnes) suffered a sharp decline, tumbling by 20% compared to October 2016 SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political and economic uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has dented business confidence, discouraging firms from splashing out on a new vehicle. Newsflash from America: Semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom has launched a $130bn takeover bid to take control of smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm. If the deal goes though, it could be the biggest technology takeover ever, says the Financial Times. Both companies are major players in the market for wireless communications chips for mobile phones. Combining them would create the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel and Samsung, according to Bloomberg. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is now addressing the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference. On Brexit, he says the UK needs to agree a transition deal soon. Delaying a transition deal until the final Brexit deal has been agreed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Corbyn (something BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gavin Patterson presumably agrees with). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging the speech in his Politics Live blog: The chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, has warned the government that it only has a couple of months to agree a transitional Brexit deal, before firms start to vote with their feet. Patterson says companies will start enacting their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit plans from the start of next year, when the value of a transitional deal to leave the EU begins to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deteriorate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for firms. Speaking at the CBI conference in London he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Clarity on transitional arrangements] That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very urgent at this moment. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll all start planning and implementing a hard Brexit scenario which is not going to be very good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked when the value of a transitional deal becomes of less use, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The beginning of next calendar year it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to begin to deteriorate in value. Ultimately the planning horizon, of most businesses I certainly talk to, is the order of a year to 18 months. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have certainty at that point you have to start planning for a worst case scenario.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the City, shares in car dealership Inchcape have fallen by 2.7% this morning, to the lowest level since mid-July. Traders seem to be reacting to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak UK car sales figures, say analysts at MorningStar: Simon Benson of AA Cars says the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on older \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirty diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cars is having a major impact - with sales down 30% year on year in October. Benson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite registrations of alternatively fuelled vehicles rising and a slight uplift in sales of petrol cars, the overall market was down by more than 12% last month as these efforts failed to balance out diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the widespread uncertainty and general confusion surrounding diesels and the potential for charges and restrictions in London and other major cities, a distinct lack of buyer confidence is the primary reason for this dramatic drop. Back in July, the government outlined plans to ban new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040, as part of a crackdown on air pollution. Industry figures have hoped that consumers would move to Euro 6 diesels (which heat Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new, tougher emission standards). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, though, suggests that many are shunning diesels, amid signs that the second-hand value of older diesels has slumped. Back in the eurozone, optimism among investors has hit its highest level in a decade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Sentix, the research group. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone investor confidence gauge soared to 34 this month, up from 29.7 in October . That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck). Sentix also found that investor sentiment towards Germany has hit an all-time high, following its strong growth this year (as highlighted by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory orders figures). Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons the decline in UK car sales shows that the Bank of England was wrong to raise UK interest rates last week. Alex Buttle of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that diesel car sales have slumped by 30% year-on-year. He blames the emissions scandal, in which manufacturers used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheat software\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to hide how much pollution they were creating. With Paris planning to ban diesels by 2024, consumers seem to be voting with their wallets. Buttle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures make depressing reading for the car industry. Petrol and alternative fuel figures were actually up in October, but diesel sales continue to flounder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share is plummeting and consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listening to rhetoric about cleaner diesel models, however much the industry drums on about it. The damage has been done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable the SMMT is not deserting diesel and urging the government to act to reassure consumers that new diesel cars will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from toxin tax punishment, is this a lost cause? Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time focus is shifted towards giving attractive tax incentives for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles to encourage growth in this area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers are showing huge interest in eco-friendly cars and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflected in new registrations. AFVs are the future of the car industry and the government need to adapt to changing times if it has any interest in keeping the new car market buoyant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The outlook for UK car sales looks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bleak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He says that the 12.2% slump in October is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alarming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and shows that consumers are very reluctant to make financial commitments at present. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, from 0.25% to 0.5%, could also hurt demand, he fears. Tombs writes: Worryingly, sales are falling rapidly even though generous discounts are available for buyers trading in old, high-polluting diesel vehicles. Most manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 diesel scrappage schemes are set to close at the end of this year. The recent further decline in consumer confidence, meanwhile, indicates that car registrations will continue to fall well into 2018. The downward trend likely will be amplified by increases in personal loan rates in response to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Rate hike. Accordingly, the outlook for car sales looks bleak. This chart highlights how sharply UK car sales have declined this year: Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at the Unite union, blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchaos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 around Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union: The fall in UK car sales has accelerated over the last three months, making October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year-on-year decline the biggest since April: January: +2.9% February: -0.3% March: +8.4% April: -19.8% May: -8.5% June: -4.8% July: -9.3% August: -6.4% September: -9.3% October: - 12.2% (because of monthly fluctuations, UK car sales are compared to the same month a year ago). Although diesel sales slumped, Britons actually bought more electric cars in October. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 36.9% year-on-year, with 8,244 new models registered during the month. That pushed sales of AFV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s through the 100,000 mark, up from around 75,000 a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! UK car sales declined by 12.2% in October, as the slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry continues. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153falling confidence among buyers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the slump that began in April continues. Car sales to businesses shrank by 26.8%, suggesting that firms are cutting back on their spending. Sales to individual private buyers shrank by 10%, in a sign that customers are more cautious in the face of rising inflation and falling wages. Diesel sales took a particular hit, shrinking by almost 30%, while petrol sales rose a little. Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures: UK new car market declines again in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down -12.2% to 158,192 units. Heavy losses for diesel as demand falls by almost a third, with -29.9% fewer registrations. Year to date registrations decrease -4.6%. This means that UK car sales have fallen by 4.6% in 2017, compared to 2016, with 2,224,603 cars registered since January. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, wants the government to reassure people that diesel has a future: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK. We urge the Government to use the forthcoming Autumn Budget to restore stability to the market, encouraging the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles as fleet renewal is the fastest and most effective way of addressing air quality concerns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every weekday morning, Business Today delivers the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics direct to your inbox.

The French private sector grew at its fastest pace in over six years in October, according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. Service sector firms and manufacturers both reported that activity was strong, pulling the French \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 up to 57.4 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Germany companies also posted solid growth - although not quite as fast as in September. The German composite PMI dropped to 56.7, from 57.7. Italy, though, came off the boil, with the slowest rise in service sector growth since last autumn. The oil price has hit a two-year high this morning. Brent crude is changing hands at $62.50 per barrel, up 0.7%, which may lead to higher fuel and energy prices this winter. This follows the news that eleven Saudi princes have been arrested as part of a sweeping purge, which seems to strengthen crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This is significant for the energy market, as prince Mohammed supports extending the current output curbs agreed by the Opec cartel. Edward Bell, an analyst at Emirates Nbd Bank Pjsc, explains (via Boomberg): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producers and exporters undergoes a transformation of its economy, some uncertainty and political risk is bound to be encountered along the way, which would be supportive for prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has beaten expectations again. German factory orders rose by 1% in September, surprising economists who expected them to fall by 1.5%. This was driven by a jump in orders for capital goods - expensive machinery and equipment. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already sparkling data has also been revised up, to show a 4.1% jump in orders - up from a previous estimate of 3.6%. It suggests that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to grow strongly. 2017 is turning into the strongest year for the eurozone since the financial crisis struck. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski is impressed.... .. as is Fred Ducrozet of Pictet bank. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales figures come at a nervous time for the auto industry. Last month, car dealership chain Pendragon shocked the City with an unexpected profits warning which sent its shares careering to a four-year low. Car makers are also worrying about Brexit, as they currently benefit from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the single market and the customs union. Production across the industry has fallen for the last five months, with new investment on hold until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Vauxhall is already planning to swing the axe, with 400 jobs going at its site in Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has struggled in 2017, with sales falling steadily since April. New figures released today will show that the slump continued last month. Sales are expected to have fallen by around 12% year-on-year in October, following a 9% decline in September. Such a steep decline will surely fuel worries over the UK economy and consumer confidence. Diesel cars sales are likely to have tumbled particularly sharply, due to the fallout from the recent emissions scandal. The official figures are due at 9am, but preliminary data has already been released, as Reuters explains: British new car sales in October fell by about 12 percent year on year, marking a seventh consecutive month of decline, preliminary data released by an industry body showed on Monday. Sales were hurt by a decline in business and consumer confidence, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders(SMMT) said. Demand for diesel cars slumped by about 30 percent, the industry body said. The SMMT urged the government to use this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn budget to restore stability to the market and encourage the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles. Also coming up today: Data firm Markit will release a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service companies. Growth probably held up well in October, with the headline PMI expected to remain at 54.9. European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, with the FTSE 100 called down 13 points from Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing high. Plus, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business chiefs are gathering in London for the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from prime minister Theresa May and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Corbyn. Expect lots of talk about Brexit...

The S&amp;P/ASX200 reached its highest level since before the global financial crisis on Tuesday and remained above the benchmark level at the close on Wednesday at 6,016 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a slight rise on the overnight close of 6,014. A strong showing from the banks helped the market offset a negative impact on mining stocks from a dip in commodity prices. Commonwealth Bank, for example, gained 2.65% after it reported a rise in its quarterly profit to $2.65bn. Investors in Australia have been buoyed by strong leads from the US and other major markets. The MSCI all-country index burst through the 500-point mark for the first time on Tuesday. It also follows a series of record highs on Wall Street, and Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in London which pushed the FTSE 100 to a record close. On Tuesday, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei also popped higher to its highest closing point in 25 years. In the US, strong profits from companies such as Apple, Amazon, Caterpillar, Mastercard, BP and Goldman Sachs have overcome concerns about the trump presidency and geopolitical issues such as tension with North Korea. The chief market analyst for CMC Markets, Ric Spooner, said the key drivers in Australia this week had been rising oil and iron ore prices last night, but it might not all plain sailing for the ASX. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As traders were reminded on several occasions over recent months, it is common for markets to test the limits of a trading range, often breaking narrowly through it. This happened on several occasions as the ASX 200 made minor breaks below the bottom of the trading range over recent months, only to rebound strongly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the ASX 200 broke only narrowly into new high ground yesterday, it did so with good trading volume, finishing close to its high for the day. These are often indications of ongoing momentum that could yet re-emerge over coming days to push the index convincingly clear of resistance, indicating renewed confidence. Time will tell.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to again leave the cash rate unchanged on Tuesday had little impact on the Australian dollar although it was lower against its US counterpart on Wednesday.",

Sources familiar with the meeting, which was also attended by Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment bank globally, said the bankers had committed to retaining \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a large proportion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of their existing UK operations after Brexit. JPMorgan employs roughly 15,000 people in the UK. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the pressure building on UK wages as firms struggle to find staff: In the media world, one of Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key allies has sold his stake in the mogul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox. The move could strengthen those shareholders who are unhappy about the Murdoch clan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domination of the group, and agitating for change. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who controls the investment firm Kingdom Holding and is one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest men, at one stage owned more than 6% of Fox and has consistently backed the Murdochs in shareholder votes about the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control of the company. He has been a shareholder in Murdoch companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including Fox and News Corp, the owner of the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for two decades and expressed public support for the family after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World in 2011. Regulatory filings in New York show Prince Alwaleed reduced his stake to 4.98% in December 2015, and an analysis of Bloomberg data shows the stake has fallen to zero since the end of the last financial quarter, on 30 September. It is not clear why he sold the stake or to whom. The sale represents the loss of an ally for the Murdochs and adds an extra twist to reports this week that Fox held talks with Disney about selling most of the company...

UNISON national energy officer Matt Lay says staff are feeling pretty nervous following the tie-up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bolt from the blue will have left many of the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 employees feeling decidedly anxious. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the merger only just announced, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no detail yet as to the number of jobs that may go, the posts most affected, or the sites at risk. Stock markets are taking a breather today, it seems. Wall Street has opened calmly, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all dipping slightly. Snap, the social platform, has slumped by 10% though after posting disappointing results last night. It is now planning to redesign its app, after failing to hit analyst forecasts for user growth or revenues. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tencent, which operates the Wechat messaging platform WeChat, has now built a more than $2bn stake in Snap.... In London, the FTSE 100 is up 11 points, or +0.1%, while the French CAC is down 0.2% and the German DAX is unchanged. The pound has been under pressure today as traders try to keep up with another day of political drama in the UK. International development secretary Priti Patel is flying back to the UK as the row over her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking holiday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Israel escalates. Could she be sacked today? Has she already been fired? Political hacks are glued to Flightradar24 for the latest. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson is in familiar hot water too, facing calls to quit after wrongly stating last week that imprisoned UK citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalist in Iran. It all leaves Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government looking anything but strong and stable, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great for sterling. The pound is down 0.5% at $1.3105 vs the dollar, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1305 against the euro. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound slipped against the dollar and the euro today as the next round of Brexit negotiations approach, amid fresh political controversy at Westminster. Progress in negotiations has so far remained incremental, but the markets are hopeful on the back of renewed discussion of a transition period from the government. Following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations that resulted in the resignation of the defence secretary, fresh controversy over Secretary of State for International Development Priti Patel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct overseas and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have put immense pressure on Downing Street. If the situation worsens today sterling could potentially be pressured lower. Irish house prices inflation has hit a two-year high, driving prices back to their highest level since the financial crisis. House prices across the Republic rose by 12.8% per annum in September, up from 11.8% in August. The Central Statistics Office explains: Dublin house prices increased 12.4%. Apartments in Dublin increased 11.4% in the same period. The highest house price growth was in Dublin City, at 13.9%. In contrast, the lowest growth was in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, with house prices rising 9.9%. This pushes the CSO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of Irish house prices up to 99.9, a whisker away from their level in 2005, and the highest level since April 2009. If British firms do cut back on investment, it will make it even harder to hit the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research and development goals. The UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to get R&amp;D spending up to to the OECD target of 2.4% within a decade, and to 3% in the long term. But in 2015, UK R&amp;D spending was \u00c2\u00a331.6bn, or just 1.7% of GDP - well shy of the target. A report issued yesterday by The Royal Society showed how Britain is lagging behind. The report warned: Increasing overall R&amp;D investment is the target. To deliver this we need to create a vibrant environment that fosters research and innovation throughout UK public services, universities, charities and businesses and attracts global investment, incentivising companies to locate their R&amp;D here. A strategic approach, alongside an Industrial Strategy, will be key to realising our ambition. Only by doing this will we improve the health and wealth of the nation. UK recruitment firms say British employers are having to offer bigger pay rises, to cope with a shortage in workers from the EU. Reuters has the details: The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said its monthly survey showed starting salaries rose in October at the second-quickest rate since November 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd REC chief executive Kevin Green said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd British workers really do need a pay rise. As these chart shows, real wages have been shrinking since the spring as inflation has rattled up to 3% - mainly due to the slump in the pound after the EU referendum. UK firms seem to be particularly reluctant to commit to new offices and factories. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agents found that firms expect to invest less in 2019 and 2020, as they await more clarity about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic future and how Brexit will play out. The agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report says: Firms in the survey expected investment growth to be little changed over the next twelve months, relative to the past twelve months. However, investment growth was expected to be somewhat weaker over the following two years. Expectations for investment growth in the coming twelve months were strongest for business services contacts, and were weakest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at broadly unchanged levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for construction. This chart confirms that firms expect to spend less: This report is based on interviews with 375 businesses, who employ 578,000 people in the UK. Breaking: UK companies are struggling to recruit new staff, and expect to hand over larger pay rises next year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents, just released. The agents found that : Recruitment difficulties had intensified and were above normal in a range of activities, alongside continued modest employment growth. As a result, pay growth had edged up and was expected to be somewhat higher in 2018 than this year. Firms suggested that pay settlements next year could be clustered around 2\u00c2\u00bd%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3\u00c2\u00bd% rather than 2%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3% during 2017. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, then Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze could end next year. The latest figures show that basic pay is only rising by 2.1%, while inflation has hit 3%. The agents also found that firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of investment growth in the following two years were weaker than last month. Many blamed economic uncertainty, due to Brexit and concerns about the future availability of overseas labour. The report says: Investment plans were being boosted by companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 desire to increase their efficiency and to meet expected increases in demand, but expectations about the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationships were dragging on spending. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agents also reported that growth in activity remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Manufacturing output growth had risen again, with export supply chains supported by the past fall in sterling and some signs of increased domestic sourcing. But construction output growth had eased. Services turnover growth remained moderate. Anne-Sylvaine Chassany, the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris bureau chief, reports that Bank of America is pressing on with its plans to move 300 staff from London: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Big Six could soon be the Big Five. No, not in the football (before any long-suffering Arsenal fans cry foul), but in the energy market. SSE and Npower have now agreed terms to merge their household supply businesses in Britain, creating a new supplier with over 11 million customers, more than anyone else. The deal, which was reported yesterday, is likely to stir worries about competition and could yet be blocked by regulators. SSE is the second largest supplier, while nPower is joint-4th largest. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Market says the deal will face \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intense competition scrutiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Especially after the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent pledge to control price increases for the most vulnerable to fix what many regard as a broken market, where prices continue to rise despite a move towards renewables. Big six to big five doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly scream \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer benefit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Marks &amp; Spencer also reports that its food sales -- usually so buoyant - dropped by 0.1% in the last six months. Rising food inflation took a bite out of profitability too, leaving M&amp;S hoping that its new Christmas advert starring Paddington Bear is a hit. Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown sees little to celebrate: The food business has been keeping M&amp;S afloat in recent years, but now progress seems to be flagging here, the clothing division needs to start pulling its own weight. The festive period also looks set to be challenging for the high street. Real wages are around 0.5% lower than they were last year, and the recent interest rate rise might well make consumers think twice about loading up on debt to fund the annual Christmas splurge. For M&amp;S it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days in the turnaround plan, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfortunate that the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structural issues have been compounded by tough times in the industry as a whole. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any champagne accompanying the marmalade sandwiches at M&amp;S HQ, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick brew, then back to work.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in the City, shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have dropped by more than 2% after it announced it is speeding up its turnaround plan. Chief executive Steve Rowe warned that M&amp;S still faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many structural issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The firms now plans to open fewer new Simply Food outlets, and accelerate the closure of other stores. CFO Helen Weir is also moving on. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Brexit continues to loom over the City of London, as the clock ticks towards 31 March 2019 when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. The Financial Times reports that major banks warned the US commerce secretary last week that they will soon start shifting jobs out of London, unless there is more clarity. The Wall Street titans, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, reportedly cited Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unstable government and the lack of progress in planning Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Collectively they employ tens of thousands of people in the City. Crucially, they warned Wilbur Ross that they are approaching the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153point of no return\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- where they have to trigger their Hard Brexit contingency plans and begin shifting jobs, capital and infrastructure overseas. As the FT puts it: Those briefed on the talks, which were held over lunch at Wilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exclusive St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s district, said the banks were particularly concerned by the failure of Britain to provide clarity over whether it will secure a transition deal to smooth the changing regulatory regime after the UK leaves the EU. They warned they had even less clarity over what a final Brexit deal will look like. Absent clarity from the government about post-Brexit plans, the executives said jobs would move back to the US or to other European capitals as banks begin to enact their worst-case contingency plans, the sources said. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThere was broad discussion around the lack of progress in the Brexit talks and some discussion around various political scenarios,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one person briefed on the talks said. UK business chiefs have also been urging Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to nail a transition deal by the end of this year. So, with Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major players getting nervous, the pressure is growing.... China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures landed shortly before Donald Trump touched down in Beijing for a state visit. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the president will want to know that China posted a trade surplus of $26.6bn with the US in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5bn less than in September, but 12% higher than in October 2016. It means that China has racked up a trade surplus with the US of $223 billion so far this year, on track to match 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total, despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises to trim it. US and Chinese companies are expected to sign several commercial deals during Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit (these agreements are typically lined up to give politicians some good news to share). The South China Posts says Beijing has four key goals: Persuade Washington to lift export restrictions on hi-tech products, so US firms could sell more to China Create more cooperation between the US and China in research and development in fields such as space and aviation Boost US participation in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Belt and Road Initiative - a massive economic expansion drive - and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Press the US to tone down its probe into alleged Chinese IP violation Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. New trade figures from China have missed expectations, which may be a sign that global growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as punchy as we hoped. Chinese export growth slowed to 6.9% in October, below expectations of 7.2% growth, and down on September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust 8.1%. Import growth also slower, rising by 17.2% last month after a blistering 18.7% in September. The figures could signal that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, after a solid year, is flagging a little this autumn -- as Beijing cracks down on pollution and tries to shift from manufacturing to services. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big picture is that both outbound and inbound shipments have softened recently, a trend that continued last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We suspect that this reflects a slight easing of growth in other emerging markets along with weaker domestic demand as a result of slower infrastructure spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mubina Kapasi, analyst at ET Now, points out that China imported less iron ore than usual, and also shipped out less steel. Given China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key role in the world economy, these trade figures may weigh on European stock markets today. David Madden of CMC Markets says: China is making a concerted effort to move towards a more service focused economy. That being said, their demand for minerals is still a major driver of commodity prices and mining companies.

The data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) also shows that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual rate of property price inflation has increased to almost 13%. The findings will be seen by some as fresh evidence that the Celtic Tiger is roaring again. The figures indicate a dramatic recovery in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market following the banking crisis and property price crash of a decade ago. As recently as January 2013, residential prices in Dublin were 56% down on the highs they hit in early 2007. According to the CSO, the residential property price index has climbed to its highest level since April 2009. In the year to September, property prices at a national level increased by 12.8%. This compares with a rise of 11.8% in the year to August and is the highest annual figure since May 2015. The annual rate of price growth in Dublin was 12.4% for houses and 11.4% for flats.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Traders took their cue from Asia, says David Madden of CMC Markets: Stocks in Europe sold-off as the sudden and severe decline in the Nikkei 225 overnight trigged fears around the world. Lately stock markets in Europe have been lacklustre as there has no major change to the economic or political outlook. The low volatility was interrupted today by the rapid drop in the Japanese market, which got traders out of their comfort zone in Europe. The sell-off is broad based, and when you look back at how much ground was made in 2017, dealers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much of an excuse to exit the market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW As ever nothing is easy in Greece. Just when prime minister Alexis Tsipras was sounding an optimistic note on the investment front earlier, the Canadian company, Eldorado Gold, has announced that it will freeze one of the biggest investment projects in the country. Sounding a defiant note, George Burns, Eldorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President and CEO said the Vancouver-based firm was not only freezing further investment in its gold copper deposit at Skouries but taking legal action Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of energy and environment, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although we have made good progress on the Olympias mine, we require the necessary permits and government support prior to investing further in Skouries,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence we are now taking the necessary legal action to enforce the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights while continuing efforts to resolve outstanding matters through ongoing dialogue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Upon approval and receipt of the required permits, the Company will re-assess its investment in the Skouries project if the government was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supportive and open to discussions regarding the use and implementation of best available technologies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The tough stance is likely to put off other foreign investors who have often cited Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labyrinthine bureaucracy and unwieldy justice systems as major obstacles to investment. In September Eldorado had threatened to halt new investment in its Olympias and Stratonii mines in the northern region of Halkidiki because of a spat over permits but subsequently backed down. With more than 2,000 employees, the firm is one of the largest foreign employers in Greece. The mood in the stock markets has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really soured this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. With Wall Street follows Europe into the red, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much optimism on the trading floors today. He writes: Despite the European Commission promising the best Eurozone growth for a decade in 2017, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices were in a bad mood this Thursday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the euro attracted most of the buzz; while the currency rose 0.3% against both the dollar and the pound the DAX and CAC plunged, dropping 1.3% and 1% respectively. An acute retail headache, and a red-soaked set of mining stocks, meant the FTSE failed to take advantage of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses against the euro (and flat performance against the dollar). Instead the UK index slid half a percent , taking it under 7500 as it was dragged lower by Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye-watering 10% decline, a 2% drop from Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a 2% to 3% falls from Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Anglo American. The worst-performing stock in Europe is Vestas, the wind turbine maker. It disappointed investors today by reporting a drop in pre-tax profits and smaller profit margins as competition gets tougher. An influential House of Lords Committee have urged the government to agree a Brexit transitional deal before the end of this year, or risk losing City jobs overseas. Having taken evidence from City experts, the EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee has concluded that ministers need to act now, before banks trigger their own contingency plans. Committee chair Baroness Falkner has written to chancellor Philip Hammond, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The clock is relentlessly ticking. Witness, after witness, told us that financial services industry won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to continue servicing cross-border clients after 2019 if a transition period is not agreed by the end of this year. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services industry will be severely hit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as will EU counterparties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The more the Government waits, the more the value of such a period irreversibly declines. A trickle of banks and insurers have started to implement their contingency plans ahead of access to the Single Market being suspended in March 2019. The Government must urgently negotiate a transition period to stop this trickle turning into a flood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street has joined the global stock market selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 103 points, or 0.4%, at the start of trading in New York. The long-running saga of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to float oil giant Aramco has taken another curious twist today. The UK government has confirmed it is close to handing Aramco a $2bn credit line. It means British taxpayers will effectively be lending the company money to encourage it to buy goods and services in the UK. The government has denied that the credit guarantee has any link to the question of whether Aramco - which is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil producer - should list 5% of its shares in London. If the IPO goes through, it will be the biggest flotation ever and would deliver a bonanza of fees for the City. But the idea has been criticised by several major investors, as existing listing rules will need to be bent for Aramco. Nick Macpherson, formally the top civil servant in the Treasury, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed at all. More here: Just in: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has risen, and by more than expected. Some 239,000 US citizens filed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial claims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last week, as the jobs market got back to normal after the hurricane season. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 229,000 in the previous seven days, and more than expected. But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very low figures in historical terms. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat eurozone growth forecasts haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brought much cheer to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets. Every major index is down today, although not massively. The FTSE 100 has shed around 40 points, or 0.55%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost nearly 1%. The FTSE 100 is being dragged down by Burberry, which is still off by 10%. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy of moving more upmarket will hurt profits for the next couple of years. Eurozone bonds are also under pressure, with prices falling and yields (the rate of return) up. There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single trigger for the selloff. But after such a long rally, investors can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blamed for cashing in some profits. Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a view out there that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as good as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get in bond markets so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth taking a bit of profit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are more pessimistic than other forecasts. For example, the IMF predicts that the UK will grow by 1.7% this year, and by 1.5% in 2018. But the big picture is unimpressive, with the EC predicting that Britain will suffer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd private consumption growth and weak business investment. Peter Dixon, Senior Economist at Commerzbank, says the forecasts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly pleasant reading for UK policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This comes just a week after the BoE projections pointed to growth of 1.6% next year and 1.7% in 2019. Although the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth path is a little higher, the key point is that very few forecasters currently expect the UK to grow at sustained rates in excess of 2%. Just as fans of the English national football team used to regard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reaching the quarter finals of the World Cup as a failure, they would happily accept such an outcome today. In a similar vein, for the foreseeable future UK policymakers who used to regard 2% GDP growth as being too slow, might look back on the halcyon days of such growth as a golden era. Looking back at the UK housing market.... rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has warned that mortgage borrowers in Northern Ireland, East Midlands, East Anglia and the South West are most vulnerable if UK interest rates keep rising. In a new report, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analyst Steven Becker says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the event of a rate increase to 1.25%, borrowers in East Midlands, East Anglia and Northern Ireland are up to 2x more likely to face financial stress and go into arrears than a borrower in Scotland.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When it raised interest rates last week, to 0.5%, the Bank of England indicated that borrowing costs would rise a few more times over the next few years. The EC predicts that Greece will grow by 1,6% this year, a little faster than the UK. This is expected to jump to 2.5% in both 2018 and 2019 (a lot faster than the UK!). And over in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has appealed to Arab entrepreneurs to invest in Greece, as he pushes the message that the transformation of the crisis-plagued country is underway. My colleague Helena Smith reports: Greece has crossed the rubicon and is now one of the best countries in the world to invest in, Alexis Tsipras told the EU-Arab world summit in Athens. Opening the second such meeting in the Greek capital the leftist leader urged businessmen from across the Arab world to grab the golden opportunity of investment in a nation that after eight gruelling years of austerity-fueled recession was finally showing signs of economic recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece for certain has emerged from crisis, Greece has crossed the rubicon of crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the conference describing the country as an especially attractive place for investment because of low acquisition and labour costs. Tsipras gave the speech as unionists attached to the powerful KKE communist party prepared mass to stage mass protest rallies nationwide. Did the EC consider a hard Brexit scenario when drawing up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts? No, we had a purely technical approach based on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcongoing status quo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, replies commissioner Pierre Moscovici. He adds that this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that a particular option is better or worse. Also, any change in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationship with the EU would affect every European country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook (so it would be unfeasibly tricky to model). Importantly, these new forecasts are based on the assumption that the EU and the UK maintain the current \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstatus quo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 2019. So if Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hammer out a transition deal, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts could prove to be too optimistic. In another blow, the EC has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit is going to rise in the current financial year. After \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several years of improvement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general government deficit is expected to rise to 2.5% of GDP in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, up from 2.3%. The EC also warns that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit could be even higher, if negotiations with the EU go badly. It says: Risks to the forecast point to upward pressure on the general government deficit, particularly in case of a Brexit-related trade shock during the forecast period. On the UK, the European Commission says that growth has been slowing as rising inflation hits consumers and Brexit uncertainty spooks businesses. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report states: Economic growth in the UK has been slowing since the start of the year, as higher consumer prices constrained private consumption growth. Based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK, growth is still expected to remain subdued over the forecast horizon. Consumption growth is projected to be modest, in line with weak real wage growth, while uncertainty continues to weigh on business investment. However, net exports are expected to provide some support to growth, and the labour market is projected to show continued resilience. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart, showing how the EC expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth to slow: The report is online here: THE UNITED KINGDOM: Slowdown in growth expected to continue European Economic Forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Autumn 2017 But....the EC also concedes that too many people across the eurozone are out of work. Unemployment in the euro area is expected to average 9.1% this year, its lowest level since 2009, dropping to 8.5% in 2018 and 7.9% in 2019. In contrast, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is just 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is presenting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts now. Sounding upbeat, Moscovici says the eurozone is expected to post its fastest growth since the financial crisis, adding: We have entered a new phase of the economic recovery, with stronger growth driven by resilient consumption, the global upswing, loose financing conditions and falling unemployment. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart from the new EC economic forecasts, showing which countries are expected to post the strongest and weakest growth (lighter = faster) Having slashed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts, the EC has also raised its forecasts for the eurozone. The Commission now believes that eurozone countries will expand by 2.2% this year, up from the 1.7% forecast earlier this year. The Commission says the eurozone has enjoyed a bumper year, having shaken off the debt crisis that gripped the region a couple of years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European economy has performed significantly better than expected this year, propelled by resilient private consumption, stronger growth around the world, and falling unemployment. Investment is also picking up amid favourable financing conditions and considerably brightened economic sentiment as uncertainty has faded,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, growth is expected to dip slightly in 2018 to 2.1%, and then to 1.9% to 2019. If the EC is right, it means the UK will lag behind the eurozone for the next couple of years.... Newflash: The European Commission has slashed its forecast for UK growth, warning that Brexit uncertainty will hurt business investment. It now expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to grow by just 1.5% this year, down from 1.8% previously. The EC also predicts that growth will slow to 1.3% next year, and just 1.1% in 2019. The forecasts also appear to be based on a transition deal being agreed that will prevent a cliff edge in 2019 and a hard Brexit. The EC says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investment growth is forecast to weaken in 2018, as many firms are likely to continue deferring investments in the face of uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the ongoing negotiation on the terms of the UK withdrawal from the EU, our projections for 2019 are based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So far this year, the UK grew by 0.3% in January to March and also in April to June, rising to 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. So the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound unduly pessimistic. RICS has surveyed chartered surveyors and estate agents from across the UK to gauge the state of the market. A number of them are particularly gloomy (although others less so). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Newcastle Upon Tyne: Neil Foster of Foster Maddison Property Consultants. Prolonged political uncertainty and weak direction from government is hampering sentiment amongst buyers and sellers. We are in for a long winter. Ilkley, Yorkshire: Bill Dale of Dale Eddison The market has slowed in the last month, albeit after a frenetic period in July and August when stock levels of available houses fell as a result of strong sales. There is a noticeable seasonal slowdown and the lack of supply is also holding back activity Liverpool: Derek Coates of Venmore: A surprisingly busy month for sales and buyer enquiries. However, there is a lack of properties coming on to the market which has been a worrying trend for some time. Vendors appear unwilling to commit in the present climate of uncertainty. Worksop, Nottinghamshire: David Hawke of David Hawke &amp; Co Although as we approach Christmas you would expect a downturn but this reduction in market activity is well beyond this, generally so quiet!! Norfolk: Nigel Steele of Jackson-Stops: A slowing market with Brexit and economic uncertainty having an effect so that it could be a long winter. Beaconsfield: John Frost of The Frost Partnership: There is life in the market at the right price! Buyers are offering lower than guide prices and sales are doing the same up the chain. Stamp duty levels have had a considerable impact on the number of potential instructions coming to the market. West Devon and Cornwall: David Lewis of Stags: Continued political and economic uncertainty is negatively influencing the market place. Actively levels have fallen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has winter come early? Lampeter, Wales: Andrew Morgan of Morgan &amp; Davies: A very busy period in the market across all sectors. This appears to be benefitting the rural lifestyle type properties most of all. No signs of depreciation at present. Putney, London: Allan Fuller of Allan Fuller Estate Agents: We usually have buyers registering keen to move before Christmas. So far we are registering 80% less than normal during October. Vendors more receptive to price drops and some are agreeing to 10% reductions, which are then attracting interest. East London: Josh Homans of Valunation: The sales market has dramatically changed and technically crashed across the board. In E2 the difference between asking and sale price is a staggering 20%. Glasgow: Grant Robertson of Allied Surveyors Autumn/winter slowdown in evidence. Strong interest for market leading homes but generally things are slower. Belfast: Gareth Gibson of Douglas Huston Supply remains very restricted however new enquiries are lower, the normal September lift was not seen. PSA, the firm which owns Vauxhall and Opel, has announced a wide-ranging cost-reduction plan including voluntary layoffs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important development for UK workers at Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plants near Liverpool, and at Luton, as well as Opel factories across Europe. PSA, which also owns Peugeot, says it hopes to avoid compulsory redundancies, as part of a plan to improve Vauxhall and Opel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Crucially, PSA is promising not to shut any factories, but there is going to be a shake-up. Opel/Vauxhall chief executive Michael Lohscheller told journalists at a press conference in R\u00c3\u00bcsselsheim, Germany, that the company would not shut any factories in Europe and try to avoid compulsory redundancies. Any cost reductions would be achieved through shorter working hours, voluntary redundancies and early retirement. Lohscheller said personnel costs in relation to revenues were too high. Some workers who are on 40 hour-weeks will be moved to 35 hours. He added the group would consult employee representatives, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153especially the works council and the union IG Metall in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and had already held meetings this morning. PSA boss Carlos Tavares, speaking at the same press conference, reiterated that the company needed to act fast to become more competitive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opel is facing a dramatic situation. There is no time to waste\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This dramatic situation is getting worse day by day. We have a significant opportunity to rescue this company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Campbell is also tweeting from the press conference call: RICS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy survey of the UK housing market gets plenty of coverage this morning. In the Financial Times, Chris Giles says: Estate agents have become more pessimistic over the housing market, saying prices have not risen at all in the past three months, newly agreed sales are down, and prices are likely to fall in most parts of the country. Andy Bruce of Reuters shows how optimism has hit its lowest level since 2012, if you exclude the wobble after the Brexit vote. Ben Chu of the Independent points out that the top end of the housing market is under the most pressure: More expensive homes are under significant downward price pressure, with 70 per cent of surveyors reporting that offers for homes in the \u00c2\u00a31m plus bracket are coming in below asking price. Some 60 per cent also reported lower offers for homes on the market priced between \u00c2\u00a3500,000 and \u00c2\u00a31m. Pantheon Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Sam Tombs is also concerned: Shares in UK housebuilders are also falling this morning, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downbeat survey of chartered surveyors and estate agents. Barratt Development are down 2.8% and Persimmon have lost 2.7%. Investors are concerned to learn that UK house prices have stalled, with fewer potential buyers making inquiries about buying a home. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, explains why Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 this morning: It was crucial Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief executive Marco Gobbetti got off to a good start after chief creative officer Christopher Bailey announced he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be off next year. Unfortunately, the market appears unimpressed with Gobbetti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy, and his first address to the market since taking over has failed to prevent the loss of big share price gains made since September. Gobbetti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim to generate high-single digit revenue growth plus \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeaningful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operating margin expansion is ambitious, yes, but the big benefits don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come through until 2021. Ouch! Shares in fashion chain Burberry have slumped by around 9% in early trading. The slide came as Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO Marco Gobbetti, who replaced Christopher Bailey in July, revealed that he wants to take the British luxury brand more upmarket. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Gobbetti reveals in a strategy update today that the company will close some outlets in department stores that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit in with this move, starting in the US, before reviewing Europe in coming years. The company said it was too early to give numbers for affected outlets and jobs. Burberry has also posted better-than-expected numbers this morning. Like-for-like retail sales were up 4% in the six months to September, ahead of the analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecast of 3% growth, with the UK growing in double digits. Rainwear did particularly well, for example the car coat and the tropical gabardine. Pretax profits also came in ahead of expectations at \u00c2\u00a3128m. Overall revenues rose 9% to \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. A spokesman said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong growth in the UK and mainland China with the Chinese luxury consumer travelling, has continued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gobbetti told investors this morning that: We will reshape our offer, increasing and invigorating the fashion content. We will create compelling luxury leather goods and accessories to attract new customers. We will build on the strength of our apparel and re-energise it. We will build our offer to provide a complete look for our customers, while continuing to simplify our ranges. However, growth slowed in the UK in the latest quarter due to a tough comparison with last year. Following the Brexit vote in June 2016, sterling fell sharply and there was an influx of tourists who bought Burberry coats and bags. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already sizeable trade surplus has widened further, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to export much more than it imports. The Federal Statistical Office has just reported that German exports rose by 4.6% over the last 12 months in September, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac110.4. Imports also rose, by 5.5%, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86.3bn. This pushed the overall German trade surplus for the month up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac24.1bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.7bn in September 2016. The figures also show that Germany ran a chunky trade surplus with the rest of the European Union - exporting \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65bn to fellow EU member states while importing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac57.6bn. That includes Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large trade surplus with the UK, of course.... Another sign that German-manufactured products are valued around the world? That the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures are paying off? Or that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest member is benefitting from the relative weakness of the euro compared to the Deutsche Mark? Probably all three.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of estate agents are getting more pessimistic about the UK housing market, as the London property market continues to cool. A new survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has found that prices nationally have stalled over the last few months, with the number of new sales dropping. More RICS members reported a fall in new buyers last month than a rise, suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the market as demand for properties cools. Sellers of the most expensive houses are also having to accept lower offers, in another sign that demand is weakening in the face of slow economic growth and political uncertainty. Here are the key points from RICS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey: National price indicator turns flat with sentiment still downbeat in London and the South East Subdued sales trends now being reported across most regions 70% of respondents report sales prices are coming in below asking prices for homes valued at \u00c2\u00a31m+ These charts show clearly how the market has weakened in the last few months, with sales expectations hitting the lows seen after the Brexit vote and during the eurozone crisis: The report is more pessimistic than recent surveys from Halifax and Nationwide. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, paints a pretty gloomy picture of the market today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The combination of the increased cost of moving, a lack of fresh stock coming to the market, uncertainly over the political climate and now an interest rate hike appears to be taking its toll on activity in the housing market. With both buyer enquiries slipping and sales expectations also subdued, the sense is that home owners are staying put and first time purchasers are increasingly focusing on that part of the market supported by the Help to Buy incentive. A stagnant second-hand market is bad news for the wider economy, not just in terms of spending but also because it restricts mobility. More details to follow.... Also coming up today... New German trade data is being released this morning, showing how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy posted another surplus in September (more on this shortly). Auto maker PSA Group is outlining its new strategy for Opel/Vauxhall this morning, in an attempt to return to profitability by 2020. The plan includes offering an electrified version of all its models by 2024. Car workers at its plants across Europe will be listening to see what it means for their jobs... Pharma group AstraZeneca, fashion chain Burberry, supermarket group Sainsbury, and energy provider National Grid and car dealership Bookers are all reporting results. Sainsbury have reported a rise in sales, but a 9% drop in profits over the last six months.

The Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investment Fund (TCI), which owns 5% of the LSE, requisitioned an emergency meeting calling for the removal of the LSE chairman, Donald Brydon, and an end to the search for a new chief executive. It is also calling for Rolet to remain in office until 2021 on the same terms of employment, assuming he wants to do so. In a letter to Brydon, the TCI founder, Sir Christopher Hohn, said Brydon had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failed to provide shareholders with any substantive basis for the removal of the chief executive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hiding behind confidentiality agreements denies shareholders the ability to review your actions and demonstrates the bad corporate governance over which you are presiding.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hohn will get the chance of a face-to-face showdown with directors after accepting an offer from the LSE to address a board meeting to be scheduled for next week. The exchange escalates an extraordinary row that began when the LSE announced in October that Rolet would depart by the end of the year, but cited only succession planning as a reason he was leaving at the age of 57. In previous correspondence between TCI and the LSE, the stock exchange has cited \u00e2\u20ac\u0153succession planning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corporate governance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to explain Rolet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure, adding that it was bound by a confidentiality agreement with its chief executive of nine years.

But Hohn said a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of shareholders want Rolet to stay and should be able to hear from him in person about whether he wants to do so.

However, the taxi app company could appeal again.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Charles</strong>, consulting barrister at <strong>Crossland Employment Solicitors, </strong>argues that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gig economy faces a major shake-up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where previously they had been treated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-employed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and denied access to any employment rights.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century:</p> <p><strong>Sam Dumitriu, </strong>the <strong>ASI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s</strong> Head of Projects, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news

August-October period up to 0.5%, they believe, from 0.4% in July-September.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2017, suggesting the economy is recovering from its early slowdown.</p> <p><strong>Amit Kara,</strong> Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at <strong>NIESR</strong>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened.</p> <p>Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand.</p> </blockquote> <p>NIESR also predict that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 2% by 2021</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated

<p><strong>My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning.</strong></p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ride-hailing firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling</a> could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision.</p> <p>Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed.</p> <p>Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal flexibility they value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The Independent Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights.</p> <p>Aslam said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Farrar said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/10/uber-loses-appeal-employment-rights-workers\">Uber loses appeal in UK employment rights case</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:47:33.578Z\">at 1.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059be4c0cdb10716cc118e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:57:27.825Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Expert: Uber can't have its cake and eat it</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers.</strong></p> <p>Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply declare that workers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if the evidence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back it up.<br></p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service.</p> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:49:26.018Z\">at 1.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059ce5c0cdb10716cc11a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:37:02.225Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model.</strong></p> <p>She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too.</p> <p>Brown explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProbably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed. If they are workers though, they may be exposed to a significant NIC liability.</p> <p>There may also be a substantial VAT liability.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:48:14.581Z\">at 1.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059827d5dec305b63b7fe1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:34:02.716Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f1a4f0998a3efa76967816024342e0d227bbb2ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a4f0998a3efa76967816024342e0d227bbb2ad/548_632_1839_3123/589.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Field MP.\" width=\"589\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Frank Field MP</strong>, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge success for workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</p> <p>He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Labour MP] Rachel Reeves and I will next week be proposing to our select committees a draft bill which would make these individual, but important, skirmishes a thing of the past as legislation would protect all workers in similar situations.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:50:24.053Z\">at 1.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a0595c4c0cdb10716cc111e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:06:35.000Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oxford law professor Jeremias Prassl is tweeting the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeremiasPrassl/status/928938803443699713\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Appeal dismissed: &#39;reality of the situation was that the drivers were incorporated into the Uber business of providing transportation services, subject to arrangements and controls that pointed away from their working in business on their own account&#39;

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the start of October, despite this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better-than-expected trade figures.

David Madden of CMC Markets says: European equity markets are in the red today as traders feel uneasy about being long going into the weekend in light on the sharp correction yesterday. The rapid move lower yesterday got traders thinking about how much markets have come in recent months, and that prompted some profit taking. And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Some late news before the weekend; US consumers have become a little gloomier. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly gauge of morale fell to 97.8 in October, a big fall from September. Time for a quick recap. Uber drivers are celebrating after the company failed to overturn a ruling that they are actually workers, not self-employed contractors. Lawyers say it is a landmark ruling, that means Uber faces liabilities for national minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. However, the taxi app company could appeal again. Kevin Charles, consulting barrister at Crossland Employment Solicitors, argues that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gig economy faces a major shake-up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworkers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where previously they had been treated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-employed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and denied access to any employment rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century: Sam Dumitriu, the ASI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Projects, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news from the UK, including... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a rise in exports to the EU. Manufacturing output has jumped, as firms benefit from the weaker pound and global economic growth But construction output shrank sharply as firms refuse to commit to new offices and factories UK GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months, a little faster than before Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth rate rose to 0.5% in the last three months, according to a new report. NIESR, the think tank, estimates that the UK growth rate picked up last month. That pushed growth in the August-October period up to 0.5%, they believe, from 0.4% in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2017, suggesting the economy is recovering from its early slowdown. Amit Kara, Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, says: Although economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. NIESR also predict that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 2% by 2021 My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take: The ride-hailing firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed. The landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision. Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed. Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central London, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal flexibility they value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Independent Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights. Aslam said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farrar said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers. Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply declare that workers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if the evidence doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back it up. He explains: Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model. She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too. Brown explains: With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProbably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed. If they are workers though, they may be exposed to a significant NIC liability. There may also be a substantial VAT liability.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Frank Field MP, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge success for workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He adds: [Labour MP] Rachel Reeves and I will next week be proposing to our select committees a draft bill which would make these individual, but important, skirmishes a thing of the past as legislation would protect all workers in similar situations.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Oxford law professor Jeremias Prassl is tweeting the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling: UK law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which represented Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drivers, are understandably delighted to have won today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling. They argue that it is a critical moment in ending exploitation of workers in the gig economy. Paul Jennings, partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite, sums up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are delighted with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgment which is ethically and legally the right outcome. The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We anticipate that tens of thousands drivers will now seek to make substantial back-dated claims. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uber could continue its battle, by appealing to the court of appeal or even the supreme court. Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde &amp; Co, warns that this will mean more uncertainty for UK companies and workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The final outcome of this case will provide employers with much needed clarity in this area. But uncertainty is likely to linger until the supreme court has and possibly beyond that, if the government commits to legislative changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cloud of uncertainty looming over the gig economy has undoubtedly made new businesses in the UK cautious about building a business model around a self-employed ad-hoc workforce, which may be further stagnating growth and therefore damaging the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is particularly concerning as the Brexit clock keeps on ticking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK needs to ensure it is demonstrating that it is open for business and at the very least showing business that there is legal clarity around alternative employment practices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jamie Jenkins, barrister at St John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Buildings, predicts that Uber will appeal again. Ruth Kennedy, barrister at 2 Temple Gardens, tweets: Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst, believes Judge Eady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling has massive consequences for other companies, as well as Uber. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implications of this appeal decision reach far beyond the price of a taxi journey home. Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model for its workforce has again been found to be fatally flawed; the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drivers are in fact workers entitled to basic rights such as holiday and sick pay. This decision has re-opened a can of worms which will have a ripple effect on the financial viability of the gig economy in its current form and beyond that into mainstream industries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unions are urging Uber to accept today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153throw in the towel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, rather than continuing its fight. TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady said: No company, however big or well connected, is above the law. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This ruling should put gig economy employers on notice. Unions will expose nasty schemes that try and cheat workers out of the minimum wage and holiday pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sham self-employment exploits people and scams the taxman. The Uber drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union GMB deserve huge credit for their work on this case.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can read the full ruling in the Uber case, here. In it, her honour Judge Eady QC explains that the Employment Tribunal was correct to conclude that an Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on, was within London, and willing and able to accept assignments was working for Uber London Ltd (ULL) under a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contract. As she puts it: If the reality is that Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share in London is such that its drivers are, in practical terms, unable to hold themselves out as available to any other PHV operator, then, as a matter of fact, they are working at ULL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disposal as part of the pool of drivers it requires to be available within the territory at any one time. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling confirms that Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drivers in the UK are entitled to various workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another victory for the two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who argued successfully that they and fellow drivers were effectively employees. The ruling has significant ramifications for the gig economy, and firms whose business model is based on flexible working patterns. Legal firm Leigh Day say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a landmark ruling. Newsflash: Uber has lost its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are actually workers. An employment tribunal in London has backed the original ruling, last year, that Uber drivers are not self-employed. More to follow.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry, though, had a bad September. Construction output slumped by 1.6% during the month, the biggest fall since March 2016. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures indicate the shadow of Brexit still looms large over the industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum causing imported building materials costs to rise, while company and UK investors caution is holding back investment in new projects, so many contractors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 margins are shrinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commercial and industrial sectors that rely on ambitious multi-million pound construction projects are the hardest hit, and only new builds in the private house sector, propped up by the likes of Help to Buy loans, are offering any glimmer of hope at the moment. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, points out that the construction sector is now in recession: Yael Selfin, chief economist at HSBC UK, reckons UK exporters should be doing better... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may finally be benefitting from stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound, says James Smith of ING. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged by the jump in manufacturing growth in September, saying: One of the big \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stories of 2017 is the global pick-up in growth. That, along with the weaker pound, has seen UK manufacturing sentiment rise noticeably. But for much of this year, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it by looking at the production numbers. But a sharp 0.7% month-on-month rise in production during September, following some better readings over the summer, suggests these positive drivers may finally be being reflected in higher output Capital Economics have stripped out oil and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 factors from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK trade figures to show how the underlying picture is improving. Despite September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent figures, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total trade deficit actually widened over the last quarter to \u00c2\u00a39.5bn. More good news! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories were running full steam ahead in September. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% over the month, easily beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. A stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance benefited the broader measure of industrial production, which also beat forecasts with a 0.7% increase according to the ONS data. The figures mean that the production sectors - which include mining and utilities as well as manufacturing - made a stronger contribution to the economy in the third quarter than previously thought, growing by 1.1% between July and September. A rise in factory activity over the three months was largely driven by the production of cars and medical equipment, the ONS said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official explanation of how Britain grew its exports to the EU in the last quarter: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00c2\u00a31.7 billion (3.8%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. As shown in Figure 2, this was due to decreases in exports of fuels (\u00c2\u00a31.6 billion) and chemicals (\u00c2\u00a31.0 billion), which offset increases in exports to non-EU countries of other commodities over the same period. Exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00c2\u00a30.9 billion (2.2%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. The main contributor was increases in exports of transport equipment (predominately cars), which increased by \u00c2\u00a30.7 billion. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has narrowed by \u00c2\u00a3700m, partly due to a rise in exports to European countries. The gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to \u00c2\u00a32.75bn in September, a better result than expected. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has been revised lower, too, to \u00c2\u00a33.45bn. The Office for National Statistics says the improvement is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 primarily due to increased exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The trade in goods deficit is also better than expected, coming in at \u00c2\u00a311.2bn. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dire figure has been upgraded to \u00c2\u00a312.3bn, not the \u00c2\u00a314.25bn initially reported. The report also shows that the UK exported \u00c2\u00a3900m more goods to European countries in the three months to September, but sold \u00c2\u00a31.7bn LESS to non-EU countries. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries increased, by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn and \u00c2\u00a31.5bn respectively over the last quarter. The ONS says: The increase in imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and fuels from non-EU countries represents the largest increase in import commodities, alongside increases of mechanical and electrical machinery, material manufactures and fuel imports from EU countries. German business leaders have weighed in on the tricky issue of Brexit, warning that time is running out to agree a comprehensive deal between the two sides. Reuters has the details: The European Union and Britain will not be able to reach a comprehensive deal on their future economic relations by the March 29, 2019, exit deadline, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest industry group BDI warned on Friday, adding that a hard Brexit was very likely. The two sides will need many years to complete a comprehensive deal on trade and investments, BDI managing director Joachim Lang told Reuters. The comments come ahead of showdown talks between prime minister Theresa May and business leaders from the UK and Europe, on Monday. UK and EU negotiators are due to wrap up the latest round of talks in Brussels later today. The latest rumour is that Northern Ireland could remain inside the European customs union and single market after Brexit. This would avoid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hard border on the island of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, reports the Financial Times. It offers the intriguing prospect that City banks could move operations to Belfast rather than, say, Frankfurt to retain passporting rights in the EU.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dank, grotty morning in the City of London, as traders await today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures. The FTSE 100 is bobbing around the 7485 mark, up one meagre point. The French CAC and German DAX are equally subdued, as the markets slope towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is hoping that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data will provide some intrigue. The FTSE has struggled in the last couple of days, with a volatile commodity sector and a flagging set of retail stocks dragging the UK index back below 7500. As for the pound, while its seen some progress in recovering last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-Bank of England losses, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still nowhere near its pre-hike highs. Against the dollar sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wrong side of $1.315, while against the euro the currency is straining to keep its ahead above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see whether the latest manufacturing and industrial production figures can make anything better a bit later. The former is forecast to fall from 0.4% to 0.3% month-on-month, while the latter is expected to nudge higher, from 0.2% to 0.3%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the goods trade balance reading, with analysts estimating the deficit to have shrunk from \u00c2\u00a314.2bn in August to \u00c2\u00a312.9bn in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deficit problem -- the gap between what Britain buys from the rest of the world, and what it sells back. New trade figures due out today may show that the UK managed to narrow this gap, a little. Economists predict that the trade deficit dropped to around \u00c2\u00a34.5bn in September, from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointingly large \u00c2\u00a35.6bn. That would be a welcome sign, but frankly the broad picture is that Britain is still struggling to rebalance its economy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been no sign, yet, that the weak pound is boosting exports. In August, the trade in goods deficit expanded to an alarming \u00c2\u00a314.2bn -- dwarfing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus in service. This goods deficit is expected to drop to \u00c2\u00a312.8bn in September - still a yawning gap in historical terms. In a flurry of data, the Office for National Statistics will also publish new UK industrial production figure. UK manufacturing output is expected to have grown by 0.3% in September, down from 0.4% in August. Then at lunchtime the National Institute of Economic and Social Research will estimate how fast the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew between August and October. We know that the UK grew by 0.4% in July to September, so these figures will show if growth slowed last month. Also coming up today... World stock markets seem a little edgy today after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Some traders blame uncertainty over US tax \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans, amid complaints that the richest Americans will benefit the most. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: President Donald Trump and corporate America may not be satisfied with the revised Senate Republican tax plan. The dollar and global equities received a hit on news that Republican senators are likely to delay the introduction of corporate tax cuts until 2019. The reaction in markets wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise, given that investors have been pricing in a lot of good news and further pullback may continue for a couple of days or weeks, as many stocks look overbought at the moment. The Senate wants to maintain the seven tax brackets, rather than the four proposed by the house. They also want to tax foreign profits held by offshore U.S. companies at a different rate. However, the timing of the corporate tax cuts will likely determine how markets move for the remainder of 2017. Meanwhile in London, Uber will discover whether its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are employees has been successful. And finally (as they say on the TV news), John Lewis are launching their Christmas advert, starring a large and cuddly creature named Moz who lives under the bed. A damning indictment of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing crisis, no doubt, but can he match the success of Monty the Penguin?....

The company warned it would cut costs further in the face of stiff competition from smaller challenger firms and May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price cap, which is likely to start in early 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, in the retail division, Innogy intends to counter this [regulation and competition] with additional efficiency measures and therefore currently maintains its outlook,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. It did not specify whether those measures would involve job losses, although industry figures have said the price cap risked having that effect. Bernhard Gunther, Innogy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are making good progress, also in the UK. Despite the difficult situation on the UK market, npower is a strong part of the planned combined retail company with SSE.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Innogy was one of the firms to recently secure a record low price from the UK government for power from an offshore windfarm to be built in the early 2020s. Separately, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EDF Energy revised down its earnings target for 2018 from at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.2bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14.6-15.3bn. The company blamed a reduced availability of its nuclear power stations and the expectation of reduced electricity consumption in France next year.",

0.5% early Monday, after the Sunday Times reported yesterday that 40 Conservative Party MPs agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Theresa May.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets ended the day in the red. The FTSE 100 lost 17 points, or 0.25%, to 7,415 - with the weaker pound propping up the index by boosting multi-nationals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares. But the French CAC lost 0.75% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed 0.4%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: In a roundabout way, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles a slightly helping the FTSE 100. The remainder of Europe is firmly in the red, but the weakness in sterling has cushioned the fall in the British index. Continental Europe is being hit by the sell-off that begun last Thursday. The shock sell-off in Japan in the latter-half of last week is still being felt around the world. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on events in parliament this afternoon: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our take on the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest report: And if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough...here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our take on the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy assessment of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the markets to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. The pound is still down, although off its lows, at $1.3105. One of the hundreds of amendments mentioned earlier has had an effect, it seems.... With plenty more amendments to come, there may be more twists and turns coming up... Over in parliament, David Davis has said MPs will get a vote on the final Brexit deal. That could be a significant development; except if parliament rejects the deal, then the UK could leave the EU anyway..... More here: John Redwood MP is under fire after financial bloggers pointed out that the pro-Brexit politician has been advising his clients at Charles Stanley to consider investing abroad..... Time for a recap. The pound has dropped against major currencies today, as concerns grow over the stability of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. Sterling ha shed a cent against the US dollar, to below $1.31, and a similar amount against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.122. The selloff came as MPs from across the political spectrum mobilised as the EU withdrawal bill headed back to parliament. Some City analysts fear that political jitters, and Brexit developments, could push the pound lower in the weeks ahead. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmounting political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the UK gripped the currency markets today. The Sunday Times newspaper reported over the weekend, that as many as 40 Conservative MPs have agreed to sign a letter of no-confidence in Theresa May. Although this was eight short of the signatures needed to trigger a formal leadership challenge, this is likely to add to the bucket load of uncertainty, translating into more pain for the British Pound. With political instability at home stimulating concerns over May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to govern and deliver Brexit, Sterling may have a very rough and rocky road ahead. Business leaders have met the PM today, and urged her to move talks forwards before Christmas. The CBI warns that jobs and investment depend on it. The IMF has also weighed in, saying that the EU and UK will both suffer if a Brexit deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed. The Resolution Foundation has warned that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential productivity growth will probably be revised down in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. This will drag on growth, and hurt wage increases. European stock markets have fallen into the red, and Wall Street is likely to follow suit. Brexit uncertainty seems to be hitting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets. The main EU indices are down around 1%, as the rise in the euro against the pound hits the value of exporters. Any sign that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority is weakening will worry investors, especially given the two-week deadline for an agreement on financial payments to the EU. In London, defence stocks are falling on fears that government cutbacks are biting. Ultra Electronics, the FTSE 250-listed defence firm, plunged by fifth after a profits warning. It told shareholders that There are mounting pressures in the funding of UK defence programmes and this has resulted in the UK MoD pausing, cancelling or delaying numerous programmes. BAE Systems, which produces weapons and military equipment for air, land and sea have fallen by 3% while Babcock are down 7%. Investors around the world will be watching the House of Commons, as the EU Withdrawal Bill debate resumes this week. Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence says the government needs to be nimble to avoid defeat on one of the many (many!) amendments. Given the large number of amendments tabled, the government of PM Theresa May will have to tread carefully to avoid defeat. The most controversial proposal will likely only be decided at a later stage: a final say for Westminster on the EU exit deal. May might have to accept such a vote, but regardless, the offer from Brussels will likely be a take-it-or-leave-it deal. Top UK business leaders have just urged Theresa May to deliver a breakthrough in the Brexit talks before Christmas. The group met with the PM at Downing Street this morning, and warned that the economy would suffer serious harm if a Brexit deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed. The CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses, hopes that negotiations can move onto Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with Europe soon, before nervous companies start to trigger their contingency plans. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With UK-EU trade worth more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600bn each year, business groups from across Europe used today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with the Prime Minister as a welcome opportunity to highlight the mutual importance of seeing real progress before Christmas. All business organisations present reiterated the damage a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario would do to trade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A transition period reflecting the current arrangements remains the priority on both sides of the Channel. While businesses welcomed the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Florence speech, we now need to move beyond warm words if jobs, investment and living standards are to be protected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moving to the next phase will enable discussions to gather momentum, so negotiators can focus on the future economic relationship. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests that a good, unique final deal reflects the strength and depth of our existing relationship and integration. This will help promote prosperity and better living standards right across Europe for generations to come.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest UK political tensions will not have gone unnoticed in Europe. Any weakening of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position fuels concern that the PM might struggle to get support for her Brexit plans, or even be ousted from office before March 2019. Over in Berlin, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert has warned that the situation is now urgent. Seibert told reporters (via Reuters) that: More progress is required as time is ticking. It is understandable that the (EU) chief negotiator (Michel) Barnier stresses how urgent it is for Britain to act promptly, to make proposals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Steffen has also weighed in, saying people should be prepared for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit.... Newsflash: Convenience chain Nisa has agreed to be taken over by the Co-op, following a vote by its storeowners. But the vote was close. The Co-op needed to get 75% support, and it barely squeaked over the line at a meeting at Leeds United football club... Some Nisa members had argued against the deal, worried that it would damage their independence (as we reported this morning). Last Friday, the Brexit negotiations intensified another notch when EU negotiator Michel Barnier set the British government a two-week deadline to clarity its position on its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexit bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. MPs will get the chance to grill Brexit secretary David Davis about the situation later today, when he gives a statement to the House of Commons. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering events in parliament here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another chart from the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget pre-briefing, predicting the worst wage squeeze since shortly after the Battle of Waterloo: Resolution say chancellor Hammond could help the situation, by cutting the cap on public sector pay rises. Here are their four priorities for next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget: Housing, going well beyond the additional Help-to-Buy funding already trailed. The government should take advantage of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-low borrowing costs to embark on a large-scale programme of state investment in housebuilding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c revising the fiscal rules to allow this to happen Revising social security plans, not only to shorten the six week wait in Universal Credit but to also reverse cuts to the new benefit and undo a deeper than expected benefit freeze Supporting the ending of the public sector pay cap with additional resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially for the NHS Ending the expensive and regressive policy of raising income tax thresholds now that the goal of a \u00c2\u00a312,500 personal allowance is within sight, instead raising revenues via freezes to income tax thresholds later this parliament Investors have been jolted out of their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcautumnal slumber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the latest outbreak of infighting in the UK cabinet, and the loss of two senior ministers (Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon) this month. So says Kathleen Brooks of City index, who points out that sterling volatility has jumped today. She writes: Firstly, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move tells us that the markets are on alert for political risks emanating out of the UK, and if there is a party coup to replace Theresa May then political turbulence is likely to weigh on the pound further. Secondly, even though the pound has had a jolty start to the week, volatility and technical signals do not suggest to us that the pound is about to fall off a cliff just yet, we may need this story to develop further to get another big move lower in sterling. Thirdly, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too complacent about the pound, the political and Brexit situations remain fluid and can throw up surprises. In future, when volatility is low in the pound investors should be on their guard that a pullback is likely. This chart from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie McGeever highlights how the pound has become more volatile, compared to the euro: As if the UK government didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough on its plate already, Philip Hammond has a budget to prepare. And it may be a depressing event. The Resolution Foundation have just published a new report, warning that UK productivity will probably be revised down next week (the budget is on Thursday). That will make a dent in the public finances - it means lower growth, and thus less progress in cutting the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit. But Resolution also warn that it will hurt households in the pocket, as weak productivity means less chance of significant wage increases. Matt Whittaker, Chief Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Budget day looks set to bring bad news about what we have the potential to produce as a country. It looks likely that we are currently living through the worst decade for productivity growth since the start of the 19th century. Resolution reckons that weekly pay will be almost \u00c2\u00a325 lower in 2022 than previously expected, still \u00c2\u00a322.70 below the pre-crisis peak. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart from their report: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some good news for people affected by the ground rent scandal: One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest housebuilders, Taylor Wimpey, has set aside \u00c2\u00a3130m in April to deal with the issue. Some buyers of its new-build leasehold properties have found themselves trapped in spiralling ground rent contracts, with ground rents doubling every ten years. The housebuilder said today it had reached agreements with freeholders to enable the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its customers with a ten-year doubling lease to switch to inflation-based increases. Ground rents will go back to their original level before they started doubling plus retail price index inflation, currently running at 3.9%. They will be reviewed every ten years in line with RPI inflation. The \u00c2\u00a3130m will go to freeholders. Taylor Wimpey said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Converting to an RPI based structure addresses concerns about the mortgageability and saleability of these properties. We continue to make good progress towards securing agreements with other freeholders to also enable the conversion of the remaining doubling ground rent leases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The selloff is picking up pace as the ructions in the UK government worries the markets. Sterling is now down 1.25 cents or almost 1% at $1.3066. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-week low, but also close to its lowest point since early September. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investing at interactive investor, says the pound is suffering from the mounting pressure on Theresa May who is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggling to maintain her grip on power\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale has now fired over his latest note to clients, outlining why he thinks the current turmoil is generally priced in. Sterling is priced for soggy growth and difficult negotiations. Both are likely whoever runs the Conservatives. The weakness of the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, like the incompetence of Mr Bean, is well known. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before we wonder who would want her job in the current circumstances; and before we wonder what her departure might do to the odds of another election, which might well put Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. And would that be good for sterling (much softer Brexit) or bad for sterling (left-wing Labour hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been around since the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst decade of all)? Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would suffer if the UK left the EU without a deal. IMF official Joerg Decressin told Reuters that a hard Brexit would cause damage on both sides of the channel: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under such circumstances, our concern is that economic growth will suffer, especially in the UK, but also the euro area. We are then possibly looking at appreciably lower growth than we presently project.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Decressin was speaking after the IMF released its latest assessment of the European economy. It believes the recovery looks increasingly assured, with Europe expected to grow by 2.4% this year (although the UK may only manage 1.7%....) City traders are studying the headlines and concluding that Theresa May is at her weakest position since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. He writes: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A LOT for May to fret about at the moment. She could be facing defeat on part of her Brexit Bill later in the week, with Tory Remainers likely to team up with Labour to try and secure Parliament a meaningful vote on any deal with the EU, something the PM is keen to avoid. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also threats from Michel Barnier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who stated at the weekend the EU was preparing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that if Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spell out how far it intends to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchonour its obligations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within the next 2 weeks then any trade talks will have to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Finally, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the leaked \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOrwellian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 letter from Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u00e2\u20ac\u201c back to scheming after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tory leadership falling out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to May, with the prominent Leaver MPs outlining a series of secret Brexit demands. The pound is also losing ground against the euro, down almost one euro cent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.122. The weaker pound has pushed up share prices in London (as it makes overseas earnings more valuable). The FTSE 100 has gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7455 points. This is the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fall in a week, according to Bloomberg. They say: Sterling fell as much as 0.8 percent to $1.3092 as leveraged accounts aggressively sold the currency, according to traders in London, who asked not to be identified as they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t authorized to speak publicly. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the pound dropped this morning: Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says sterling is suffering from Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak position: Sterling fell more than 0.5% early Monday, after the Sunday Times reported yesterday that 40 Conservative Party MPs agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Theresa May. While this remains short of the 48 votes needed to force a new leadership, it still creates much frustration amongst investors seeking clarity on Brexit negotiations. With May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position being potentially at risk and no significant progress after six rounds of talks with EU, Sterling may come under increased pressure in the next couple of days, with the $1.3024 support level at risk of being breached. A leaked letter from Boris Johnson and Michael Gove pushing for Hard Brexit, add to the uncertainty as House of Commons meet on Tuesday. But....Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada suggests Tory MPs will be reluctant to oust May, given the opposition Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid performance in the polls... We have argued before that UK political risk is underpriced (bookies odds point to a high probability of an election in 2018 or 2019, with Corbyn as the single most likely next prime minister). But note there were 35 MPs ready to sign a no confidence letter after May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic party conference speech and the hurdle to be MP number 47 or 48 should be high, given Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the polls. The pound is still down 10% compared to its value before the EU referendum (when it was worth almost $1.50). Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale tweets: (EM = emerging markets, HY = high yield, or riskier bonds that give a better return. The rest doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require translation....) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has fallen this morning as pressure mounts on prime minister Theresa May over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union, ahead of some crucial votes in parliament this week. Sterling has shed almost a cent this morning, to below $1.31, after the Sunday Times reported that 40 Conservative members of Parliament have agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in her. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the number needed to trigger a formal leadership battle, creating new jitters in the City and beyond about the stability of the UK government. In another significant move, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and environment secretary Michael Gove have written a letter to May complaining that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some parts of Government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing enough to prepare for a hard Brexit. This letter, which leaked over the weekend, appears to be an attempt to undermine chancellor Philip Hammond (as he puts the finishing touches to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget). One minister has described the move as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Orwellian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, suggesting that the cabinet is badly split as MPs return to parliament to debate the Brexit bill. My colleagues Rajeev Syal and Jon Henley report: Another minister said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I doubt they thought this would ever come out. It stinks to high heaven. May will have to dress them down or look weak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another former cabinet minister said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe this has come out. This is exactly the kind of arm-twisting by Brexiters one expects to go on behind the scenes, but the fact that it is in the public and is being inflicted upon the prime minister is remarkable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It all tees up another dramatic week, with parliament due to start debating the EU withdrawal bill again on Tuesday. There will be fireworks, with a group of MPs planning to propose an amendment to give Parliament a binding vote on the final divorce deal between Britain and the EU..... Also coming up today... Bookmaker Ladbrokes and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey are reporting results this morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep an eye on the Dubai Air Show - yesterday, Emirates announced a $15bn deal with Boeing. That was a surprise, as Airbus was expected to win a big deal for its Airbus A380 superjumbo - can it bounce back today?",

The dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better; while it held flat against the pound, largely due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation and wage growth issues, it shed 0.1% against the euro and 0.4% against the yen.</p> <p>Things were just as glum in Europe. The FTSE is down around 50 points thanks to its commodity stocks, and is trading at its worst price since the end of September, while the DAX, displeased at the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience, has shed nearly 120 points to hit a fresh 6 and a half week low. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c5983be620206ef71cb66\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/juliakollewe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T15:19:23.030Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK used car sales fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the UK, and sales of used cars fell over the summer, according to the industry body.

Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears.</p> <p>What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month.</p> <p>With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to rate movements.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year.</p> <p>Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago.</p> <p>This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018.</p> <p>There was some equally good news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter.</p> <p>All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c522402d23606ce8c99d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T14:53:50.088Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales rise, as consumer prices edge up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter</p> <p>An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials.

In September, the consumer price index had climbed 0.5%.</p> <p>The data - the inflation figures in particular - was seen as negative for the dollar. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest gain witnessed in three months.</p> <p>Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar.</p> <p>Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively.

                "bodyText":"Continuing strength in the euro, a falling oil price and a decline in US markets, have combined to pull most European shares lower. On Wall Street, worries about a Chinese slowdown and concerns over the Republicans successfully implementing their tax plans were additional negative factors. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 41.81 points or 0.56% at a five week low of 7372.61 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.44% to 12,976.37 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.27% at 5301.25 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.62% to 22,158.88 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bucked the trend, up 0.24% at 10,013.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.19% to 718.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 87 points or 0.38%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Markets may be lower but could be supported at these levels. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: Stocks are falling, volatility is on the up, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth appears to be weakening and we even have a military coup to deal with. On the face of it, the situation would be ripe for a big selloff in equity markets, but this is not 2008 or even 2015. Below the surface some sectors, such as utilities, are recovering, while in the UK and Europe markets are off their lows. It is options expiration week, and a look at positioning through put/call ratios suggests sentiment has become excessively bearish. Plus, Thanksgiving is on the horizon, and the week before this all-American holiday tends to be a good one. The bears can almost taste victory, but I suspect that 2017 will work its magic once again and the dip buyers will have their way. The concerns about a rise in US crude stocks last week proved well founded. They climbed by 1.85m barrels compared to earlier forecasts of a 2.2m drop. Gasoline stocks rose by 894,000 barrels as opposed to the expected 0.9m decline. Oil prices remained in the doldrums after report but at least recovered from their lows, with West Texas Intermediate now doen 0.46% at $55.24 a barrel. US markets remain in negative territory although the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down 131 points or 0.5%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets looked pretty bloody this Wednesday, with the euro once again the only real winner. With US investors already fretting about the Republican tax reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push them through after they failed so spectacularly on healthcare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a weak pair of inflation and retail sales readings didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do much to help matters. The former came in as expected at a measly 0.1% in October, down from 0.5% in September, while the latter arrived at a better than forecast, but still miserly, 0.2%. Neither figure substantially threatens a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve; however, the tendrils of doubt are never too far away, meaning the US markets could have done with something more robust to drive away the current gloom. Instead the Dow Jones is stuck with a 130 point fall, taking the index to a sub-23300, near 4-week nadir. The dollar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better; while it held flat against the pound, largely due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation and wage growth issues, it shed 0.1% against the euro and 0.4% against the yen. Things were just as glum in Europe. The FTSE is down around 50 points thanks to its commodity stocks, and is trading at its worst price since the end of September, while the DAX, displeased at the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience, has shed nearly 120 points to hit a fresh 6 and a half week low. Back in the UK, and sales of used cars fell over the summer, according to the industry body. Julia Kollewe writes: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said today that the used car market declined for a second quarter, with sales down 2.1% between July and September from a year ago. About 2.1m secondhand cars changed hands. Superminis are still popular, making up a third of sales. Along with SUVs they were the only categories to show growth. Silver remains the most popular used car colour, closely followed by black. Sales of hybrid and electric cars rose 17% to 25,196 units (electric cars alone urged 66.4%). While petrol sales fell 6.5%, demand for diesels rose 4.2% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in stark contrast to new diesels where sales have fallen sharply. After a bumper first quarter the market remains at record levels, with more than 6.3m buyers opting for a used car in the first nine months of this year, up 0.1% on the same period last year. Simon Benson, director of motoring services at used car website AA Cars, said:\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales of used cars have suffered - but not nearly at the same rate as the new car market, which experienced a double digit decline last month. A lack of consumer confidence has rippled out across the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retail sales and inflation figures are likely to add more fuel to the fire in terms of a US rate rise next month, analysts believe. But there is some uncertainty as to the future trend of borrowing costs, especially with a new Fed chair for the new year and a change in the composition of the decision making panel. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears. What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month. With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to rate movements. ING economist James Smith said: A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year. Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago. This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018. There was some equally good news from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter. All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year. Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials. Economists had forecast no change. Meanwhile the September figure was revised upwards from 1.6% to 1.9%. On the inflation front, consumer prices edged up 0.1% in October as a boost to oil prices from the hurricane-related disruptions to the Gulf Coast fell away. In September, the consumer price index had climbed 0.5%. The data - the inflation figures in particular - was seen as negative for the dollar. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest gain witnessed in three months. Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar. Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively. A solid breakout back above 94.50 threatens the current bearish setup. US markets are on the slide again, hit by a falling oil price and continuing worries about the ability of the Republicans to achieve their proposed tax cuts. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.9% at $55.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency issued a gloomy outlook on the prospects for global demand for oil. Later come the latest US crude inventory figures, with investors worried they might show an increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 155 points or 0.66% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.58%. Back in London, a Bank of England deputy governor has insisted that wages should rise in 2018 as low unemployment forces bosses to pay more for labour. Obviously there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much sign of this happening yet, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lacklustre wage growth. But Ben Broadbent insists that reports of the death of the Phillips Curve (the classic inverse relationship between unemployment and pay) were exaggerated. Broadbent told an audience in London that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Several commentators have questioned the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central prediction that wage growth will rise next year. Some have gone further and pronounced the death of the Phillips curve. There are always risks to any forecast. But the latter claim, at least, is premature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadbent also blamed the tumble in the pound after the EU referendum for pushing down real wages, as the weak currency made imports pricier and thus pushed inflation up. Breaking away from UK unemployment briefly, there are three important developments in Greece. First, the Greek government has launched a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn debt swap, asking investors to hand over existing bonds in return for new debt. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to ease Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 return to the financial markets after years of bailouts. These new bonds won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mature for many years, sparing Greece any nervy repayment deadlines. But secondly, ratings agency DBRS has warned that Greece is unlikely to make much progress in its current bailout talks this year. Thirdly, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftist-led government has taken further steps to relax capital controls that were imposed to stop its banks collapsing during the crisis two years ago. Helena Smith reports from Athens The Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative of impending exit from seemingly perpetual crisis took a knock today as the Toronto-based rating agency said it was unlikely that Athens would complete crucial bailout talks before the end of the year. In a note the ratings service reckoned a compliance review with international auditors representing creditors keeping Greece afloat would not be completed until 2018. Wrapping up the review was key to unlocking debt relief talks and discussions on the type of support Greece would receive once its current bailout programme ended in August next year Meanwhile, the leftist-led coalition took another step Wednesday towards easing capital controls imposed to prevent a run on banks at the height of the debt crisis. A degree that went into effect today, foresees depositors being able to fully withdraw sums in bank accounts transferred from overseas as of December 1st. People who have not previously held bank accounts will also be able to open one under the new regulations signed by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and published in the government gazette. Despite what the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted (see earlier) UK unemployment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually a record low. The current jobless rate of just 4.3% is the lowest since 1975; in early 1974 it was just 3.6%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless total of 1.42 million also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a record - it was lower in 2004 and 2005. Thanks to economics professor Danny Blanchflower for flagging this up. In another significant development, The Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust has warned an extra 42,000 young people dropped out of the labour market and the education sector in the last three months. This group became economically inactive, and were not in education or training either - a worrying sign. Joe Levenson, communications and campaigns director at the Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust, says the jump highlights the challenge facing young adults - particularly mothers with young children. Levenson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u015342,000 more young people are now economically inactive and out of education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a dramatic increase on the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women in particular are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by a lack of convenient childcare and support. While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, 343,000 young women who are not included in the numbers are being left jobless and forgotten. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the same time, we have a youth debt epidemic, which is only set to worsen as prices rise and wages remain low. It can be especially hard for young mums; in many cases, an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s childcare can cost more than an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Much more needs to be done to improve young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available, and extended the National Living Wage to under-25s, so they are paid the same amount for the same work. This will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how the number of young adults who have left the labour force has risen, while those in work or looking for work has dropped: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has just welcomed the drop in unemployment and the rise in productivity seen today. (I suspect this tweet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come directly from the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thumbs; it would be very disrespectful to tweet during Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions - as Hammond is sat next to Theresa May on the front bench) The number of people from other EU countries working in Britain has hit a record high, up by 112,000 in the last year. That takes the total number of EU nationals to 2.38m. There are also 28.55m UK nationals in work (up 183,000 in the last year), and 1.21 million non-EU workers (down by 23,000). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key chart: My colleague Alan Travis has examined the data, and writes: The figures from the Office of National Statistics show that the number of Polish and other east European nationals working in Britain has dropped for the first time in more than 10 years, down from 1,054,000 in the summer of 2016 to 1,035,000. The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has, however, continued to rise, from from 257,000 to 347,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 90,000 increase that accounts for the majority of the overall increase in the last year.

Positive Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director Fran Boait hopes that Philip Hammond can help next week - especially as the Bank of England has raised the cost of borrowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As real pay continues to fall, households are being forced to borrow ever-greater amounts to make ends meet. The economy is being kept afloat on the back of families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit cards, at increasingly high interest rates. In the budget later this month, the Chancellor must act to boost investment and deliver a sustainable boost to incomes, before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a rates rise - now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a pay rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Resolution Foundation, the UK think tank, fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market is losing momentum. They are concerned by the drop in employment over the summer, as it could show the labour market is plateauing. The persistent failure of wages to rise when workers have been in shorter supply is another worry. They say: The biggest pay squeeze is taking place in other service sectors (-2.7%), public administration (-2.2%) and real estate (-1.9%), while pay growth is strongest in agriculture (+3.9%) and in support services (+0.8%). Stephen Clarke, Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic analyst, expects real wages to keep falling for the next few months. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After years of impressive growth, there are signs that the labour market may be losing momentum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The still strong picture on employment still refuses to have any meaningful impact on wage growth, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay squeeze is getting deeper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome productivity figures offer a glimmer of hope on pay, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to say whether it can grow into a meaningful recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Resolution have also produced some charts to explain the pay squeeze: Amid the real wage gloom, there is an encouraging sign..... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to have become more productive. The ONS estimates that productivity per hour grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first increase since the end of 2016, and is the highest rate of growth since Quarter 2 2011. This could be a crucial factor in getting wages up -- as bosses have been blaming weak productivity for the meagre pay increases doled out to their staff. David Willett, Corporate Director at The Open University, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcencouraging development\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For too long the UK has been lagging behind, with a lack of higher skills limiting the agility and adaptability needed to drive organisations forward. Stagnant productivity is a significant barrier to growth at an uncertain time when we need to ensure the stability of our economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Organisations now need to keep this up. With technology advancing at a rapid rate, and businesses looking to automate where they can, low-skilled jobs are increasingly under threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial that organisations invest in training their staff to build up essential technical and soft skills to future-proof them against changes in the political, economic and technological environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for everyone in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister for employment, Damian Hinds, has hailed the drop in UK unemployment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strength of the economy is driving an increase in full-time, permanent jobs and a near-record number of people are now in work thanks to the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welfare reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When unemployment fell to 5% early last year, many people thought it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much lower, and yet it now stands at 4.3%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut income tax for 30 million people since 2010, meaning people keep more of their money each month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the labour market looks quite different if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the opposition front bench. Debbie Abrahams MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, points out that the cost of living squeeze hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stats are further evidence of Tory economic failure, only a week out from their next Budget. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over seven million people live in poverty in working households. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour will introduce a \u00c2\u00a310 an hour real Living Wage, scrap the public sector pay cap and reform the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failing Universal Credit programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain is now suffering its second wage squeeze since the financial crisis, as this chart from the FT shows: How can unemployment and employment both have fallen, I hear you cry. The answer is that the number of adults classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomically inactive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has gone up. That means more people have simply dropped out of the labour market altogether. Geraint Johnes, Research Director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour market statistics show unemployment continuing to fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by some 59000 between the second and third quarters of this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.3%. The most recent fall, however, is due largely to a large increase in the number of people deemed economically inactive. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key chart, showing how the number of economically inactive people in Britain rose by 151,000 in the last quarter. That will include students, people stopping work to care for a family member, or look after young children, or just giving up the search for a job altogether. Professor Johnes has also spotted that more people are only working part-time: Meanwhile, part-time employment has risen, with an increase of 18000 part-time employees and 45000 part-time self-employed. Inasmuch as it continues a trend towards greater casualisation and insecurity in the labour market, this should be noted as a cause for concern. Overall the level of employment has fallen. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing wage squeeze is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge body blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to consumers as they try to make ends meet in the run-up to Christmas, says Maike Currie of Fidelity International She fears that real wage growth will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elusive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for some time: With a number of factors keeping a lid on our earnings - from people working flat out in the gig economy yet still struggling with paltry pay, more and more people in self-employment, falling unionisation, automation and technology substituting man for machine, this is unlikely to change any time soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nick Macpherson, formerly the top civil servant at the Treasury, fears that the UK labour market is cooling.... Here are some charts showing the state of the UK labour market: This chart from the Office for National Statistics shows how wage growth has struggled to get much above 2% this year. And that means that real wages are falling, whether or not you include bonuses: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in nominal terms (that is, not adjusted for price inflation) increased by 2.2% both including and excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.5% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. The pound has risen slightly, as City traders welcome the pick-up in wage growth in the last quarter. Breaking! The number of people in employment across the UK has fallen, for the first time in nearly a year. There were 32.06 million people in work in July-September, which is a 14,000 drop on the previous quarter. This is the first drop since August-October 2016, and the biggest decline since April-June 2015. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 75.0%, down slightly compared with April to June 2017 but up from 74.4% for a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at a 42-year low of just 4.3%. Unemployment fell by 59,000 between July and September to 1.42 million, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 182,000 less than a year earlier. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages squeeze continued to bite in the last quarter, according to the latest Labour Market report just released. Basic pay rose by just 2.2% per year in July-September, meaning that wages continued to lag inflation. Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.2%. In contrast, inflation was 2.7% in August, rising to 3% in September and October. More to follow... Britain has rediscovered its taste for Angel Delight! Sales of the retro desert are up 30%, in a boost for Premier Foods. Angel Delight first hit the shelves in the late 60s, when UK cuisine was more basic.... Overnight, Japan has posted its seventh consecutive quarter of growth, the longest run in over a decade. Japanese GDP rose by 0.3% during the July-September, with rising exports making up for weaker domestic demand. This will be welcomed by Tokyo as it tries to put Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost decades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind it, and achieve steady growth and inflation. But it also means Japan will be one of the slower-growing G7 nations in the third quarter; Germany grew by 0.8%, America by 0.75%, France and Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by 0.4%. All eyes on Canada.... On a nominal basis (not discounting for inflation), Japanese growth was 0.6%. This chart, from manufacturing group EEF, shows how UK wages have fallen below inflation (the dotted line) this year: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report will paint a picture of an economy suffering from subdued wage growth, but enjoying record low unemployment. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the pound could suffer if the wage figures are particularly bad. He writes: Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is at a 42-year low, the buzzkill remains, that little sign of rising pay growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. If average earnings struggle to pick up, consumers are likely to continue feeling the squeeze, especially when considering how inflation remains at a five-and-a-half year high, at 3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real wage squeeze is set to deepen today, when we get new data showing how the UK labour market is performing. Economists predict that basic pay (excluding bonuses) grew by around 2.2% per annum in the July-September quarter, up from 2.1% a month ago. Any increase would be welcome, but this would still leave wages lagging behind inflation - which ran at a five-year high of 3% in September and October. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada warn that UK wages will remain subdued for several months, but might then rise faster. With the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Regional Agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey indicating pay settlements could pick up next year to 2.5-3.5% next year, it could well be some way into 2018 before there is sufficient evidence from the labour market reports that pay growth is making a meaningful advance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report may also show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate stuck at just 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. In theory, such a tight labour market ought to drive wages higher as bosses compete to recruit workers. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: With unemployment at 42 year lows of 4.3%, it surely can only be a matter of time before wage pressure starts to manifest itself further..... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already started to see increasing evidence that wages at the lower end of the income scale are rising at rates faster than inflation as the effects of increases in the minimum and living wage help pull up wages at the bottom of the pay scales. This should inevitably see a trickle up effect as earners higher up the income scale start to demand higher wages in a tightening labour market,.

Cummings joined GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aerospace division in North America in 2008 and became head of the entire aerospace business in January 2014. Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Working capital writedowns happen from time to time, but when they come in waves of ever increasing size investors start to get worried, and with good reason. If US aviation is broken, what about the rest of the business?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hans B\u00c3\u00bcthker, the former chief executive of Fokker Technologies, which GKN acquired in 2015, becomes the new head of its aerospace unit immediately, faster than planned. It is GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second big boardroom shake-up since September. In the UK, GKN has closed its Yeovil factory, where 221 people worked on making airframes for Royal Navy helicopters. The RBC Capital Markets analyst Wasi Rizvi described Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major knock to management credibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The turmoil may be seen by some as perhaps making a break-up more likely \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The appointment of an independent interim chief executive may also prompt some fresh thinking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the writedown would also cast further doubt on the attractions of the aerospace division as a standalone business. GKN, which used to be known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefold, traces its history back to 1759 and the industrial revolution. It has grown from a south Wales ironworks that supplied cannonballs to the British army during the Napoleonic wars. Two centuries later, GKN emerged from the second world war as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest steel producer. Today, its components are used on the Porsche 918 Spyder, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Ariane 5 rocket. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is unusual for one FTSE 100 company to be in such a state of managerial flux, but we currently have two, if you include the London Stock Exchange which is readying itself to find a successor to [its chief executive] Xavier Rolet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted that the average tenure for a FTSE 100 chief executive was 66 months.",

                "bodyText":"After recent declines, it was a slightly rosier picture for stock markets today, helped by some positive results from US businesses Wal-Mart and Cisco and some relatively positive economic news. But worries about the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 US tax reforms mean investors remain cautious. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stocks markets in Europe are higher today as the bargain hunters move in. For now the selling pressure has cooled, but traders are still cautious after the market endured several days of selling in a row. One positive day won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t erase the memory of the declines that we saw recently. As we approach the end of the year, we could see further selling pressure as investors look to square up their position before the year ends. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.33 points or 0.19% at 7386.94 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.55% to 13,047.22 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.66% higher at 5336.39 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.22% to 22,206.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.75% at 10,088.7 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 2.43% to 701.36 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 197 points or 0.85%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Coinciding with the Bank of England forum in Liverpool, governor Mark Carney has told the Liverpool Echo that interest rates could rise a couple of times in the next few years. he told the paper: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how the economy evolves. If it evolves broadly in line with our projections we would probably raise interest rates a couple of times over the next few years. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some pretty big forces, some pretty big decisions still to be taken with respect to Brexit by the UK Government and the Europeans and all of those things can affect the path (of the economy). The full story is here. One eminent Twitter user whose every tweet seems to cause headlines is Lloyd Blankfein, and his latest comments are about Brexit. Jill Treanor writes: The boss of Goldman Sachs has suggested a second EU referendum to confirm there is a consensus in the UK on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153monumental and irreversible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit decision. Lloyd Blankfein, in his latest intervention via Twitter on Brexit, said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lots of handwringing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from chief executives about Brexit and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough and risky road ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reluctant to say, but many wish for a confirming vote on a decision so monumental and irreversible. So much at stake, why not make sure consensus still there?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: Markets are heading higher after recent declines, helped by positive results from a couple of US corporations and some better than expected data. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European and US markets are following the lead of their Asian counterparts, with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widespread losses being left behind for a more positive outlook today. The final remnants of the third quarter earnings season have helped US indices along, with a strong showing from Cisco and Wal-mart providing a boost as we leave behind a quarter which saw significant outperformance bred largely from low expectations. The outperformance of Wal-Mart is particularly welcome, with rising sales helping the World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer to gain over 8%, boosting the retail sector ahead of the crucial festive period. The retail sector boost was felt on both sides of the Atlantic, with the October UK retail sales figure outperforming across the board, helped by a historically low pound. However, while we saw retail sales beat expectations, the fact that the year-on-year figure remains in negative growth will not be lost to economists, with the economy continuing to flounder amid an uncertain economic outlook. Investors are also cautious about the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed US tax reforms, and whether they will be passed by lawmakers or not. Carney is asked about being criticised for commenting on Brexit by both sides of the polictical spectrum. He says, we have to look straight through that. The only thing political for us is if we try to anticipate a political reaction. We have a responsibility under law to identify major risks to UK financial system and the broader economy. In advance of the referendum and today we see some of the most important risks relate to Brexit so when we testify to Parliament and when we sit here...we view that there are risks and there are big risks and we have to disclose those under law, then we have to say what we are doing to reduce those risks and again be honest and open, and say if there are some risks we can address you should know about them and hold others to account for addressing them. He is asked, did the bank do a good enough job in explaining what it was worried about? He says, we were under a statutory responsibility to identify risks. If there was a vote to leave, we said the exchange rate would go down - you can judge whether it did. We said there would be pressure on UK financial institutions. We let them put collateral with us so they could borrow almost unlimited amounts with us, we co-ordinated with other central banks, so in the morning after the referendum...we could stand up and say we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well prepared, the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be fine. That is the criteria we should be judged against. Some people during the campaign didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know there were risks, but there were, we did our best to address them... There are risks associated with the nature of leaving, it matters what type of deal we get, it matters what the timeline is. With that the session ends and the governors mingle with the audience. On Brexit, Carney adds that the Bank makes a judgement about how businesses and households are acting today, what their expectation is in the end. Businesses are not investing as much as when financial conditions are good, but they are also not acting as if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a very bad outcome from Brexit. Households are being more affected by the real income squeeze than a concern about future wages under a bad Brexit scenario. What matters is how those expectations change in time, that will happen when there is real information. It could go either way. Whatever happens we will be nimble enough to bring inflation back to target while supporting the economy, and the core of financial system will be there. On Brexit, Sir Jon Cunliffe says the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is to ensure monetary stability, make sure whatever happens people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about inflation, and financial stablity, so people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about disruption to the fin system as we saw in the crisis. We do this by working closely with banks so when things change, there is no disruption to financial services, in terms of things like insurance contracts. We test the banks to make sure they are strong enough to withstand a big event. We are helping government to turn EU law on financial services into UK law. And we have to stay nimble so we can take action as it becomes clear what sort of Brexit it will be. Sam Woods is asked how the Bank keeps banks safe. We have all sorts of complicated frameworks but they come down to two things: does the bank have enough of its own money to absorb any losses, and are the people running the bank honest, competent and know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing. If either question is no, we take action. It would be easy to crush all risk out of the system, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do that, we want banks to do useful things like lending to consumers and businesses. Woods is asked about why the money was put into the banks rather than helping the NHS. He says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair point. Back in 2008 we put \u00c2\u00a366bn into two of our banks, same number as all currency in circulation. It was a terrible thing, and a lot of work we;e done is to make the system stronger so that next time we have more options and not just taxpayer writing a cheque. Sir Jon Cunliffe adds that the money was put in not to save the bankers but to save the economy from the bankers. The anger [about the crisis] is well justified. Ben Broadbent is asked to explain why interest rates rose at the most recent meeting, in two and a half minutes. He emphasises the importance of stable inflation, saying volatile inflation is not good for economy, and it makes it difficult for businesses to plan. We vary the interest rate to ensure inflation is stable. Inflation can be too low as well as too high. After the financial crisis, the danger was it was too low, interest rates were cutt to ensure that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. After the referendum, the value of the currency fell, all stuff we buy from abroad went up in price and pushed up the rate of inflation. Although interest rates are at historic lows, the MPC did decide to put them up at last meeting. It makes borrowing a bit more expensive, adds a little bit to savings, helps to control inflation. On wages he said: Wages are not going up as rapidly as they used to before the crisis. The problem we have in the economy is productivity, how much more productive we get over time. That is fundamentally why wages are growing less quickly. On whether interest rates are effective, he said the policy has worked pretty well. After a couple of days of decline, US markets have opened in positive territory after strong earnings from Cisco and Wal-Mart. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 130 points or 0.57% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.39% higher and Nasdaq Composite 0.55% better. Away from the Bank, some more US data. Industrial production rose by more than expected in October, up 0.9% compared to a 0.4% rise in September, as output rebounded after the effects of the recent hurricanes. Analysts had been expecting a 0.5% increase last month. Talking about the difficulties of communicating, Carney says the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charter in 1694 begins with a 700 word sentence, which no one would do now. Not clear and open transparent communication. Carney moves onto the economy, and says the recovery since the financial crash has been slower than the Great Depression, real incomes have fallen. But more recently the UK and local economy has picked up. Carney says they will discuss what causes changes in the economy, what effects they have and what role the Bank has (the team has been around schools this morning talking about this.) He says people think economists are perceived as being terrible about explaining the economy in an accessible way, and that is what they are now trying to do. Mark Carney is introducing the session, talking about Liverpool and his favourite football team (Everton) and favourite band (the Lightening Seeds) and dropping the occasional groan-inducing song title into his comments. Here are the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governors waiting to answer questions: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Forum in Liverpool is set to begin shortly, details here and follow it live here. The Bank describes it thus: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will discuss what we have been doing to make the economy and our work more accessible to all. We will showcase initiatives like our new education programme, our revamped major publications and our new website. For this session we will partner with Economy and Rethinking Economics, who are at the forefront of the campaign to make economics open, relevant and accessible. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asking for full and frank feedback on what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done so far and what we might do in future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Top officials including Mark Carney, Ben Broadbent and Sir Jon Cunliffe will be answering questions. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week, partly because authorities are still clearing backlog of claims in Puerto Rico following the disruption caused by hurricanes. New claims increased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 in the week ending 11 November, the US Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a fall in the number of new claims to 235,000. Sales at Asda, Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK supermarket chain, rose over the third quarter, by 1.1% on a like-for-like basis. It was slower than the 1.8% growth achieved in the previous quarter, but marked the second consecutive rise in quarterly sales following three years of falls. Walmart boss Doug McMillon said lower prices were encouraging shoppers to buy more: In the UK, Asda delivered positive comparative sales again this quarter. The improvements in store experience and price investments are increasing store basket sizes. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re excited to have Roger Burnley lead Asda into the future as chief executive starting next year. Over the past year, Roger has been our chief operating officer and deputy chief executive and he has a long and distinguished retail career. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to thank Sean Clarke for the tremendous work that he has done over the past year to stabilise the business and position it for growth. Over in the US, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer has reported its 13th consecutive rise in quarterly like-for-like sales, driven by growth in both shops and online. Sales at Walmart stores open for more than a year rose 2.7%, excluding fuel, in the third quarter ending on 31 October. Analysts were expecting weaker growth of 1.7%. Adjusted earnings a share increased to $1, beating expectations of 97 cents a share. Doug McMillon, Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and chief executive: We have momentum, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see customers responding to our store and eCommerce initiatives. We are leveraging our unique assets to save customers time and money and serve them in ways that are easy, fast, friendly and fun. The results, together with strong earnings reported by Cisco, are expected to boost Wall Street following two days of losses. Mark Carney (and some of his senior colleagues from the Bank of England) will be hosting a session from 2pm on what they have been doing to make the economy and the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work more accessible. Details below for anyone wanting to follow the event live: The British Retail Consortium says the October retail sales data from the ONS shows retailers are feeling the impact of the squeeze in household finances (as prices rise faster than wages): These figures suggest retail sales held up better in October than other sources have suggested, however there is still little cause to start the Christmas celebrations. Consumers are clearly feeling the squeeze, with sales down year on year and spending being directed into the second-hand market. It is therefore, vital that the chancellor does not add to the pressures on UK households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances in his upcoming budget. Scottish Widows chairman Nick Prettejohn has been named the next chair of the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. Prettejohn, a former BBC Trustee, will join Trinity Mirror, which is in talks to buy Richard Desmond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Express Newspapers for \u00c2\u00a3125m, in May. The pound is up a touch after the UK retail sales data, which showed stronger-than-expected growth in sales at 0.3% in October. Sterling is currently up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.3189, and up 0.5% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1212. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, gives his take: A better than forecast - but far from great - UK retail sales reading has managed to cheer up the pound. Superficially October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales reading wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad, coming in at 0.3% against the 0.1% expected and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upwards revised -0.7%. However year-on-year the figure actually fell 0.3% - the first annual decline since March 2013 - meaning you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to be pretty desperate to treat the data as positive. Yet after the inflation and wage growth misery of the last couple of days, desperate the pound is. Andrew Sentance, former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, says that Philip Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so keen to stress Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relative growth performance when he presents his budget next week: Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has said the Uber appeal process could go on for a number of years. Uber is currently appealing against the decision by Transport for London to strip it of its London licence on the basis that the company is not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd private car hire operator. The firm can continue to operate in the capital until it has exhausted the appeals process... Khan is taking questions from the London Assembly: Eurozone inflation was 1.4% in October according to Eurostat, confirming its earlier flash estimate. It was a slight drop from 1.5% in September. Fuel, hotels and milk, cheese and eggs made the biggest contributions to inflation last month, while clothing and social protect held it back. Here is a table showing how inflation rates across the European Union compare (showing the UK has one of the highest rates at 3%): Consumer reluctance to spend money in October was evident in clothing sales, which fell by 1.5% over the month. However, retailers are putting a lot of that down to warmer weather, which they say put people off from stocking up on winter clothing. The ONS says: Feedback from a number of clothing retailers suggested that a particularly mild October meant that consumers delayed purchasing winter season clothing. The Met Office summary for October 2017 said that the UK mean temperature was above the long-term average for this period. James Smith, economist at ING, says that while the warmer weather played a part in the drop in clothing sales, there is also a broader weakness in consumer spending: After a fairly sharp slump in September, retail sales stagnated in October as unseasonably warm weather meant shoppers weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replenishing their winter wardrobes. But as weak readings from Visa and the British Retail Consortium have highlighted in recent months, consumers are still remaining very cautious more generally, particularly when it comes to non-essentials. The household spending squeeze may have passed its worst, and indeed we think headline inflation will trend downwards from here. But wage growth remains under pressure, and with jobs growth showing early signs of stalling, we think incomes may not accelerate as fast as the Bank of England is hoping in 2018. That means consumers are likely to continue to take a cautious approach to spending for at least a couple more quarters. Some economists are not overly impressed with the 0.3% rise in retail sales in October, cautioning that it still paints a pretty weak picture of the consumer backdrop. Demand for second-hand goods was a key driver of the 0.3% increase in monthly retail sales, according to the Office for National Statistics. Consumers bought antiques, fine art and visited auction houses and charity shops in greater numbers in October. Computers and phones were also popular items last month. Kate Davies, a senior statistician at the ONS, says: We are continuing to see an underlying picture of steady growth in retail sales, although this October suffered in comparison with a very strong October in 2016. Growth month-on-month in October was particularly strong in the second-hand goods sector, which includes auction houses and antique dealers. Retail sales have beaten expectations with a 0.3% increase in October. Economists forecast 0.1%. August has also been revised up slightly to show a sales drop of 0.7%, compared with a previous estimate of a 0.8% fall. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to prevent the first drop in annual sales since March 2013, with sales in October down 0.3% compared with a year earlier. UK retail sales data for October are coming up at 9.30am and should provide a key insight into consumer spending habits as real wages fall. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a 0.1% pick-up over the month, following a 0.8% fall in August. The figures are also expected to show the first annual drop since March 2013, with economists predicting a 0.6% decline compared with October 2016. Wasi Rizvi, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says the shock departure of GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive designate is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another knock to confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after a profit warning a month ago. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning is clearly more one-off in nature than October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, it is a major knock to management credibility. The turmoil may be seen by some as perhaps making a break up [of the group] more likely and we expect that investors will continue to see value creation potential in such a scenario. The appointment of an independent interim chief executive may also prompt some fresh thinking. However today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update will also further call into question the attractions of GKN Aerospace as a stand-alone business, given it appears that margins have been overstated in the past. Here is our full story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise announcement: Engineering group GKN is the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst performer this morning, with shares currently down 8%. It follows the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock announcement that chief executive designate, Kevin Cummings, has been pushed out before he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even started the job. An extraordinary announcement from GKN this morning. The engineering giant has ousted Kevin Cummings, the man who was picked in September to take over as chief executive in December when Nigel Stein retires. Cummings, who was until today head of GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aerospace business, has left \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with immediate effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His departure follows further write-downs in its US aerospace business which are expected to be somewhere between \u00c2\u00a380m and \u00c2\u00a3130m. A statement from the company reads: The GKN board has concluded that the next stage of GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development is best delivered under alternative leadership. As a result, Kevin Cummings, previously CEO designate, will leave the board and GKN with immediate effect. The board has asked Anne Stevens, currently a non-executive director of the Board, to assume the role of Interim Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2018 until a successor is appointed. As planned, Nigel Stein will continue as Chief Executive until he retires from the role on 31 December 2017. The FTSE 100 is slightly higher this morning, up just 5 points at 7,377. Here is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,377 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.5% at 13,036 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.4% at 5,321 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.04% at 22,150 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.5% at 10,065 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 383 Commenting on the current state of the economy, the Bank of England governor said the UK was worse off than it would have been if Britain had voted to remain in the EU. We have not done as well in the short term as we would have done if the vote had gone the other way. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone from being the fastest growing economy in the G7 to one the slowest. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney gave reassurance this morning that the Bank of England stands ready to do whatever it can to support the UK economy in the event of any Brexit shock. In an interview with ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning Britain, the governor said policymakers at Threadneedle Street would keep inflation low and the financial system secure, whether or not a Brexit deal was struck with the EU. We will do whatever we can to support the economy during the transition - whether there is no deal or a comprehensive deal. We can provide support by keeping prices low and stable and by making sure banks can withstand whatever shock that might come whatever deal we have. People shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about inflation and financial stability. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make sure inflation stays low and the banks stay strong. Carney added that a transition deal would be in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and negotiators were working with that goal in mind. He gave the interview in Liverpool, where he will be joined today from his colleagues Ben Broadbent, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden and for the 2017 Bank of England Future Forum. The policymakers will visit schools across the city to discuss the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in serving society.

                "bodyText":"The Norwegian central bank, which runs the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has told its government it should dump its shares in oil and gas companies, in a move that could have significant consequences for the sector. Norges Bank, which manages Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1tn fund, said ministers should take the step to avoid the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value being hit by a permanent fall in the oil price. The fund was built on the back of Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hydrocarbon wealth, and around 300bn krone (\u00c2\u00a327.73bn), or 6%, is invested in oil and gas companies. The recommendation by Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank pushed down shares in European oil companies. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of oil and gas shares hit its lowest level since mid-October on the news and was trading down 0.39% by late afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The return on oil and gas stocks has been significantly lower than in the broad equity market in periods of falling oil prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the bank explained in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore, it is the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth can be made less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices if the GPFG [sovereign wealth fund] is not invested in oil and gas stocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Norwegian government said it would consider the proposal, but a decision should not be expected until next year and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thorough assessment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was required. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issues raised by Norges Bank are complex and multifaceted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the finance ministry said. The bank did not set a deadline for when the fund should drop its oil and gas holdings. However, it made clear that its recommendation involved divesting from existing oil and gas shares as well as ruling out future investments. The fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest oil and gas holding at the end of 2016 was $5.36bn in Anglo Dutch firm Shell, followed by $3.06bn in ExxonMobil, $2.04bn in fellow US oil firm Chevron, $2.02bn in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BP, and $2.01bn in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total. It also has shares worth more than $1bn in oil services firm Schlumberger and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eni. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move was welcomed by Paul Fisher, former deputy head of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority and senior associate at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not surprising that we see the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest sovereign wealth fund managers no longer prepared to take the increasing risk associated with oil and gas assets, which do not have a long-term future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Greenpeace Norway welcomed the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention, but said Norway must now also cease exploring for oil in the Arctic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Norway is already heavily invested in oil and gas resources, so selling off the oil fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fossil stocks will clearly help reduce our financial carbon risk,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Truls Gulowsen, head of the group. Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest private pension by value said that if the fund did ditch oil and gas stocks, the action could influence other investors. Jan Erik Saugestad, chief executive of Storebrand Asset Management, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From a financial point of view this makes perfect sense, and we have been arguing for this for many years. This is a rational move given the overall exposure the Norwegian economy has towards oil.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group 350.org, said the move was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as astonishing as the moment when the Rockefellers divested the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest oil fortune\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. McKibben was referring to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to divest from fossil fuels in 2014. The oil price fell below $30 a barrel in January 2016 during a two-year slump, but has since recovered to just over $60 in recent weeks on geopolitical uncertainty and expectations that major oil-producers will extend production curbs. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"A downbeat end to the week for equities saw declines in most major markets. Worries about the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects of getting their tax cut proposals left Wall Street lagging, while some downbeat results and broker downgrades undermined European shares. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.26 points or 0.08% at 7380.68 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.41% to 12,993.73 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.32% lower at 5319.17 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.51% to 22,092.95 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.78% at 10,010.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.58% to 712.46 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 82.9 points or 0.35%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Carillion is one of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers following another profit warning. Jill Treanor writes: Carillion, one of the construction companies working on the HS2 London to Birmingham rail line, is racing to refinance its business after issuing its third profit warning in five months and suffering a collapse in share price. Shares in the company, which is at the heart of several major building projects in the UK, were suspended eight times on Friday after the shock update to the City that it would breach the terms on its existing lending at the end of the year. The shares crashed 60% when the stock market opened on Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to their lowest ever levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and were still down nearly 40% near the end of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. At this price, about 25p, the shares are barely a tenth of the 240p level seen at the start of 2017 and values the company at just \u00c2\u00a3120m. Carillion has debts of \u00c2\u00a31.6bn and analysts expect the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known for its work on expanding the main stand at Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anfield football ground and its ongoing development of Battersea power station \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to have to ask its lenders to swap their debt for shares. The company employs 30,000, two-thirds of them in the UK, and has contracts with the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Ministry of Defence. It is building hospitals including Merseyside\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Liverpool and also has a support services operation which has maintenance contracts for buildings. The government, one of its major customers, said it was being kept informed. The full story is here: Meanwhile over in Athens thousands of Greeks chanting anti-austerity and anti-capitalist slogans are marching through the city centre to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against military rule, writes Helena Smith. Greek riot police, bracing for possible violence, are out in force. Communist party members, holding red flags aloft, are leading the protest and using it to decry the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbarbaric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policies enforced on workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brussels you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to disentangle yourself from the left\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is among the chants currently wafting over the capital. Anti-US slogans are also rife with demonstrators deploring the agreements the leftist led government recently signed with Washington during official White House talks between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and US president Donald Trump. Global markets are shrugging their way towards the end of the week, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The Dow Jones dipped 50-ish points after the bell, keeping the right side of 23400 as investors (very lightly) fretted over the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to get their tax plan through Congress. The dollar, meanwhile, could only ease, rather than eradicate, the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, with the greenback down 0.1% against the pound, 0.2% against the euro and 0.5% against the yen as investors process the news that Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign officials back in October. Over in the Eurozone the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains continued to cause a headache for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices. The DAX slipped 0.1%, the CAC 0.4% and the IBEX 0.8%, cementing a rather miserable week for the trio. As for the FTSE, despite a relatively flaccid performance by the pound, and the reversal of early losses in the commodity sector, the UK index just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything going this Friday. Instead it sat flat around 7390, preventing from taking off thanks, in part, to United Utilities and Severn Trent. The UK water sector was hit by a downgrade on United Utilities from HSBC analysts, who cut their recommendation from buy to hold. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $8000 after reports that a software upgrade which could split the cryptocurrency in two was going ahead. The price had fallen last week on suggestions the upgrade would be suspended. The move would mean owners of Bitcoin would in theory also hold the new spin-off, and sell it at a profit. Bitcoin has risen more than 700% this year and is on track for its best week since July. David Cheetham, chief market analyst, at XTB said: Major fundamental concerns remain as to the efficacy of Bitcoin but for now price remains in a strong uptrend and many observers experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) are looking at any drops as buying opportunities. After showing good gains on Thursday, US markets are on the slide again. With the latest results season coming to a close and no major economic data due, investors are focused on political issues, especially concerns about the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to get their tax reforms through Congress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 66 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.14% lower. But the Nasdaq Composite has bucked the trend, opening broadly flat. One standout performer is retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. After more than a year of declines, it reported strong quarterly sales growth of 4% and forecast postive sales for the forthcoming holiday period. Its results were boosted by a strong performance from its surfwear brand Hollister. The company, which failed to sell its business in July, saw its shares jump 20% following the latest figures. Shares in Carillion have fallen from about 240p at the beginning of this year to 28p today: US homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as communities hit by hurricanes started to replace homes damaged by flooding. Housing starts jumped by 13.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million homes, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since October 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller number, at 1.18 million homes. The increase in starts ended three consecutive monthly declines. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently up 1.2% or 72 cents at $62.05 a barrel. But it is still on course for the first weekly loss in six, as Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to cut production fuels concerns of oversupply. Prices are expected to end the week 2% to 3% lower than the end of last week. Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said the rise today shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be overplayed. After five days of continuous losses, an upside correction is always on the cards. Such a jump, however, will not mean a change of heart. Over in Greece, EU auditors have given a mixed verdict on the handling of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three bailouts. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The three financial lifelines thrown Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015 achieved their overarching goal of averting default but were far from successful in other respects, EU auditors have concluded. Issuing their first in-depth look into the cash- for-reform programmes, the independent Luxembourg-based court of auditors said Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued inability to finance itself on international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains a challenge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Design and implementation of economic policies was poorly judged, the watchdog claimed, with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic depression being much deeper than ever envisaged as a result of tough fiscal measures. It added: The [EU] commission did not comprehensively consider Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implementation capacity in the design process and thus did not adapt the scope and timing accordingly. More than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac350bn has been poured into Greece by the EU and IMF to keep the country afloat. The Greek government, which is preparing to exit the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn rescue programme in August 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is desperately trying to rally spirits ahead of that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c did not comment on the report. It is far from sure if Greece will require further aid when its current programme officially expires. The FTSE 100 has reversed its earlier losses and is now up 15 points, partly because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier gains have largely been erased. The FTSE tends to do better when the pound is weaker, because so many of the companies listed have significant overseas earnings. Here are the current scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,402 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 13,065 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 5,345 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 22,158 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,058 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 384 The pound has lost some of its earlier sparkle and is now trading roughly flat against the dollar at $1.3197. It has also slipped agains the euro, down 0.2% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1186. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains the gravity of the situation facing Carillion and its shareholders: Shares in Carillion have collapsed yet again as the troubled construction company stated it will breach its banking covenants. The company also lowered its profit outlook again and stated that their asset sale programme isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going as fast as they had hoped. Things have gone from bad to worse at Carillion, and the business is in dire need to cash to keep the lights on. Even though the business has plenty of work in the pipeline, it must scramble for cash in order to keep its head above water. The UK government is one of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest clients and is monitoring the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles. Reuters quotes a spokeswoman at the Cabinet Office: The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carillion horror show continues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is how Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, describes the latest developments at the construction firm. He adds: Some sort of recapitalisation was inevitable, but a possible debt for equity swap, with debt even higher than the group had anticipated, is probably as bad as anyone would have guessed. The group has made some progress on asset sales, and it sounds like some cost savings are being made. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what the group expected though, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly not enough. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also probably irrelevant given the state of the balance sheet, with net debt already many multiples of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation. Carillion shares plunged as much as 60% in early trading after the construction group involved in HS2 and Battersea Power Station issued its third profit warning of the year: The group now expects that a combination of delays to certain PPP disposals, a slippage in the commencement date of a significant project in the Middle East and lower than expected margin improvements across a small number of UK Support Services contracts, partially offset by cost savings initiatives realised in the fourth quarter, will lead to profits for the year to 31 December 2017 being materially lower than current market expectations. Shares are now down 37% at 26p. The company, which is struggling to cope with a large debt pile and badly-performing contracts, said the board expects a covenant breach at the end of December and will need to implement a recapitalisation plan. Keith Cochrane, interim chief executive, said: Whilst we continue to target cash collections, reduce costs, execute disposals and focus on delivering for our customers, it is clear that significant challenges remain and more needs to be done to reduce net debt and rebuild the balance sheet. Constructive dialogue is continuing with our financial stakeholders, and I am grateful for their support. I remain focused on addressing this issue before my successor, Andrew Davies, takes up the role on 2 April 2018. Love it or hate it, Black Friday is almost upon us. In recent years Britain has embraced the American tradition where retailers slash prices the day after Thanksgiving. British shoppers are expected to spend \u00c2\u00a310.1bn in the week of Black Friday, which falls on 24 November this year. Just in case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested, here is a piece we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done on some of the best deals going this year: News of Greggs controversial decision to replace the baby Jesus with a sausage roll in an advent calendar has rippled across the Atlantic: Draghi concludes by returning to one of his favourite themes, saying eurozone governments should do their bit to secure future economic stability by getting their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiscal houses in order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB will do our bit, you do yours, is the message: ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate is framed in terms of price stability, as this is the best contribution that we can make to the welfare of citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the economy to be able to grow along a balanced path that can be sustained in the long run. This is the guiding principle of all our monetary policy decisions. With the recovery ongoing, now is the right moment for the euro area to address further challenges to stability. This means actively putting our fiscal houses in order and building up buffers for the future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just waiting for growth to gradually reduce debt. It means implementing structural reforms that will allow our economies to converge and grow at higher speeds over the long term. And it means addressing the remaining gaps in the institutional architecture of our monetary union. The full text of Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is available on the ECB website: Here comes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the ECB president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. Mario Draghi says that despite solid growth and rising employment, inflation is not at the point where it will pick up without stimulus from the central bank. (Eurozone inflation dipped to 1.4% in October from 1.5% in September.) He says the recovery thus far has been highly dependent on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support. The key quote: We are not yet at a point where the recovery of inflation can be self-sustained without our accommodative policy. A key motor of the recovery remains the very favourable financing conditions facing firms and households, which are in turn heavily contingent on our policy measures. An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term. The ECB announced last month that it would slow its bond-buying programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month starting from January. However, it extended the support for at least another nine months to the end of September 2018, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi says. The key message here is that ECB policy is likely will remain supportive for some time to come. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Draghi is running through stats to illustrate how much the employment picture has improved in the eurozone. He says it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a remarkable success story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that unemployment has come down in the single currency-bloc at the same time that participation in the labour market is rising, as more women and older people enter the workforce. Consumption is being supported by a virtuous circle between rising labour income and rising employment. Employment in the euro area has reached its highest level ever, while unemployment has fallen to its lowest rate since January 2009. Importantly, this has taken place against the backdrop of a rising participation rate, which is now 2 percentage points above its pre-crisis level. This has been driven in particular by the increased entry of women into the workforce, whose participation rate has risen by 4 percentage points since 2008 and reached an all-time high. It has also been strongly driven by older people. Since the start of the crisis, the participation rate has increased by 3.6 percentage points for people aged 50-54, 13.6 percentage points for 55-59 year olds and 17.1 percentage points for 60-64 year olds. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is speaking in Frankfurt at the European Banking Congress. He begins on a positive note on the outlook for the eurozone economy: The euro area is in the midst of a solid economic expansion. GDP has risen for 18 straight quarters, with the latest data and surveys pointing to unabated growth momentum in the period ahead. From the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective, we have increasing confidence that the recovery is robust and that this momentum will continue going forward. The FTSE is suffering from the stronger pound this morning, Spread Ex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell says: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.4% against the greenback, with the dollar losing its House tax plan-passing buzz, as Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen Trump campaign officials. Against the euro, meanwhile, sterling nudged 0.2% higher, keeping above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12. This meant the FTSE continued to founder around the 7380 mark, dipping 0.2% as it struggles to escape its 6-week lows. As has been the case all week, commodities are doing their part, with a smattering of red among the oil and mining stocks helping suppress appetite in the UK index. The FTSE 100 is down 17 points this morning, and the biggest faller among its major European peers: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,370 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.2% at 13,074 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.02% at 5,335 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.01 at 22,204 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,074 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.02% at 385 Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, has been interviewed by the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, Larry Elliott, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth a watch if you missed it: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has a spring in its step this morning, hitting a two-week high against the dollar of $1.3252. Sterling is benefitting from a sharp sell-off of the dollar triggered by reports in the US that special counsel Robert Mueller served President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election campaign a subpoena in mid-October, requesting documents relating to Russia. As CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson explains, positive sentiment earlier in the day (generated by the passing of a bill in the House of Representatives aimed at cutting US company rates from 35% to 20%), quickly evaporated: The passing of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill helped the US dollar close near its intraday peaks yesterday, while also helping push up US yields with the 2 year yield hitting its highest level since October 2008. These US dollar gains were pretty short-lived and soon gave way to selling on reports that Trump officials had been subpoenaed by special attorney Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian involvement in the Trump Presidential campaign. This sent the US dollar sharply lower against the yen, dragging on the Nikkei as well as pushing the euro above 1.1800 and the pound to a two week high above 1.3200. The pound is currently up 0.3% at $1.3229 and is up 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1223. The dollar index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies - is down 0.2%.

Neither can Merkel unilaterally provoke early elections via a confidence question. After all, the newly elected Bundestag has never expressed its confidence in Merkel in the first place; she currently serves merely as caretaker.</p> <p>Therefore, the next step is necessarily the attempt to elect a chancellor in the Bundestag. There is no time limit, but Steinmeier must eventually propose to MPs a candidate he deems best placed to win support in the Bundestag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this remains likely to be Merkel, lead candidate of the strongest parliamentary group. Without any coalition agreement in place, she will not receive the required support of an absolute majority of all MPs (355 out of 709) in the first round of voting.</p> <h2><strong>14 day deadline, caretaker government, and Europe</strong></h2> <p>In consequence, a 14-day deadline kicks in during which this vote could (theoretically) be repeated multiple times. This, however, is likely only if, for instance, the SPD were to change its mind and opt for another grand coalition.</p> <p>In the meantime, Merkel and her grand coalition cabinet continue to serve as caretakers. Hopes in the UK for a political deal with Berlin on Brexit were unrealistic before but have now become even less likely. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiation guidelines, including the need to pay a sufficient amount of money in the run-up to the December European Council, are still the basis for any deal, now more than ever. Eurozone build-out jointly with France remains a task for the next government, but conversations will remain on ice until the deadlock in Berlin has been broken.</p> <h2><strong>How to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections</strong></h2> <p>Absent such developments, however, another round of voting must be held within 14 days of the first round. This time, a plurality of votes is sufficient for a candidate to be elected chancellor (i.e., the candidate who receives the largest number of votes is elected). It is then up to the federal president to decide, within seven days, whether to appoint the elected candidate on the basis of this plurality vote. The result would be a minority government. The alternative option for the president is to dissolve the Bundestag and call early elections. These would have to be held within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament.</p> <p>As a result, mid-February would be the earliest possible date for snap polls. The exact timeframe, however, depends on how quickly Steinmeier proceeds in the coming days towards proposing a candidate for chancellor to the Bundestag. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12e93baa484106f489b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T14:40:57.901Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d41a26b71788dd72ec8ddd44cc95d6a98eee0538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d41a26b71788dd72ec8ddd44cc95d6a98eee0538/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12e52360526906e8cba066\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T14:26:47.810Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64c2e7249fd2c757e5e72c7aab90a1d7c56881f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64c2e7249fd2c757e5e72c7aab90a1d7c56881f8/0_0_3500_2294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi in Brussels today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi in Brussels today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Brussels, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to MEPs.</strong></p> <p>Draghi hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mentioned the situation in Germany in his opening statement.

The current economic outlook provides a unique opportunity to reduce the likelihood of severe shocks by strengthening the economic structures of Member States, with policy actions both on the fiscal and structural side.</p> <p>At the same time, boosting the resilience of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) implies also reinforcing our common institutional set-up so as to prevent and manage shocks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12e08baa484106f489b4b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T14:03:59.768Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The key part of Frank-Walter Steinmeier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement came when he urged all political parties to consider helping to form a new government.</strong></p> <p>The German president said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153All political parties elected to the German parliament have an obligation to the common interest to serve our country.</p> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect from all a readiness to talk to make agreeing a government possible in the near future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12dc5260526906e8cba001\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T13:45:04.326Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a577090fc65cbe22b64ceed4ae0c0db6f9954eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a577090fc65cbe22b64ceed4ae0c0db6f9954eed/0_0_3500_2230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier giving his statement on the coalition deadlock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier giving his statement on the coalition deadlock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Axel Schmidt/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12da2e60526906e8cb9fe2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T13:44:15.698Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">President Steinmeier: All parties must help find a solution</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier is delivering a statement in Berlin now, following his meeting with Angela Merkel.</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Steinmeier </strong>says that Germany faces an unprecedented situation, following the breakdown in coalition talks between the CDU/CSU, the FDP and the Greens.</p> <p>He says he expects all parties to be prepared to help find a solution.

                "bodyText":"A late PS.... Could Germany be heading for new elections? Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: Angela Merkel has indicated that she would rather have fresh elections than try to rule in a minority government as the collapse of German coalition talks posed the most serious threat to her power since she became chancellor more than a decade ago. Merkel, who has headed three coalitions since 2005, said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very sceptical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about ruling in a minority government and suggested she would stand again as a candidate if elections were called in the new year, telling public broadcaster ARD she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a woman who has responsibility and is prepared to take responsibility in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Time for a recap. European investors are bracing for fresh upheaval after Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition talks collapsed overnight. With Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as chancellor looking less secure, analyst are predicting further volatility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and possibly losses in the weeks ahead. Right now, the euro has lost 0.3% against the US dollar, to $1.176. It has also lost ground against the pound, which is up 0.6% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.127. The markets were jittery after Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Free Democrats walked out of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJamaica coalition talks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU/CSU bloc, and the Green party. As things stand, there seem to be three outcomes 1) Merkel tries to govern in a minority government, perhaps with support from the centre-left Social Democrats 2) Fresh elections are held, likely early next year 3) The FDP return to negotiations. President Steinmeier has urged all sides to act responsibly, saying they have a responsibility to do their best to ensure Germany has a stable government. The ball is now in Steinmeier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court; he must recommend a candidate to be chancellor, which MPs in the Bundestag will vote on. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what might happen next. After suffering early losses, European stock markets are are little higher this afternoon. The possibility that Angela Merkel might not govern as chancellor for several more years has caused some head-scratching in the City. It could make it harder for her to offer Brexit concessions to the UK, or to support French president Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for European reforms. Wolfgang Bauer, fixed income fund manager at M&amp;G Investments, says the outcome of the German crisis will drive markets in the weeks ahead. If the grand coalition was to be renegotiated and went ahead, this would mean political stability in Germany and support for risk assets like equities and corporate bonds. I expect that the SPD would be able to push through more of their agenda and this might mean further steps towards European integration, reaching out to Macron. If however negotiations between CDU/CSU and SPD fail and we are heading towards a minority government or even snap elections, I would expect to see market volatility increase due to rising political uncertainty in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic powerhouse. It would be less likely that any major European integration projects would be pushed forward for the foreseeable future. It is important to note that the tail risk remains and currently it does not seem to be priced in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A clip of Frank-Walter Steinmeier speaking this lunchtime, complete with subtitles for English readers: Teneo Intelligence have kindly sent over an explanation of how Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political system will proceed, following the breakdown of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJamaica coalition talks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last night. A Bundestag vote is the next step As a lesson from the Weimar days, the Bundestag cannot dissolve itself. Neither can Merkel unilaterally provoke early elections via a confidence question. After all, the newly elected Bundestag has never expressed its confidence in Merkel in the first place; she currently serves merely as caretaker. Therefore, the next step is necessarily the attempt to elect a chancellor in the Bundestag. There is no time limit, but Steinmeier must eventually propose to MPs a candidate he deems best placed to win support in the Bundestag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this remains likely to be Merkel, lead candidate of the strongest parliamentary group. Without any coalition agreement in place, she will not receive the required support of an absolute majority of all MPs (355 out of 709) in the first round of voting. 14 day deadline, caretaker government, and Europe In consequence, a 14-day deadline kicks in during which this vote could (theoretically) be repeated multiple times. This, however, is likely only if, for instance, the SPD were to change its mind and opt for another grand coalition. In the meantime, Merkel and her grand coalition cabinet continue to serve as caretakers. Hopes in the UK for a political deal with Berlin on Brexit were unrealistic before but have now become even less likely. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiation guidelines, including the need to pay a sufficient amount of money in the run-up to the December European Council, are still the basis for any deal, now more than ever. Eurozone build-out jointly with France remains a task for the next government, but conversations will remain on ice until the deadlock in Berlin has been broken. How to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections Absent such developments, however, another round of voting must be held within 14 days of the first round. This time, a plurality of votes is sufficient for a candidate to be elected chancellor (i.e., the candidate who receives the largest number of votes is elected). It is then up to the federal president to decide, within seven days, whether to appoint the elected candidate on the basis of this plurality vote. The result would be a minority government. The alternative option for the president is to dissolve the Bundestag and call early elections. These would have to be held within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament. As a result, mid-February would be the earliest possible date for snap polls. The exact timeframe, however, depends on how quickly Steinmeier proceeds in the coming days towards proposing a candidate for chancellor to the Bundestag. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today. Over in Brussels, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to MEPs. Draghi hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mentioned the situation in Germany in his opening statement. Instead, he argues that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is solid and broad-based, but also warns the euro area must be strengthened to help it deal with upcoming risks. As Draghi puts it: The EU Treaties gave the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This is the best contribution we can make to the welfare of our fellow citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the euro area economy to achieve a balanced growth path that can be sustained in the long run. But this is not the only condition. Achieving a balanced growth path also requires to strengthen the euro area ability to deal with risks, whenever they will materialise. The current economic outlook provides a unique opportunity to reduce the likelihood of severe shocks by strengthening the economic structures of Member States, with policy actions both on the fiscal and structural side. At the same time, boosting the resilience of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) implies also reinforcing our common institutional set-up so as to prevent and manage shocks. The key part of Frank-Walter Steinmeier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement came when he urged all political parties to consider helping to form a new government. The German president said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All political parties elected to the German parliament have an obligation to the common interest to serve our country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect from all a readiness to talk to make agreeing a government possible in the near future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier is delivering a statement in Berlin now, following his meeting with Angela Merkel. Steinmeier says that Germany faces an unprecedented situation, following the breakdown in coalition talks between the CDU/CSU, the FDP and the Greens. He says he expects all parties to be prepared to help find a solution. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be speaking to the leaders of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political parties, and the heads of other institutions, to see if a government can be formed. Steinmeier also reminds Germany that the world is watching, saying it is clear that European nations would be concerned if the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t form a stable government. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it - he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any questions. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democrats, who came second in September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, are sticking to their policy of not joining a grand coalition with Angela Merkel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a party document seen by Reuters, which reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the results of the Sept. 24 election, we are not available for entry into a grand coalition,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd read a SPD paper due to be discussed by party leaders that was obtained by Reuters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not afraid of new elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets have now recovered their earlier losses as traders await news from the Merkel-Steinmeier talks. Political analyst Nina Schick suggests the political uncertainty could last for months, though, meaning traders will remain nervous. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report from Berlin. Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political difficulties could be bad news for the UK over the Brexit talks. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, reckons it will be hard for the chancellor to give Britain any concessions, as she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to take a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpragmatic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. She will be preoccupied with domestic issues and unable to assume a leadership role in the EU. She was expected to return to the European fray as the leader of Germany and push for a faster more pragmatic approach which would be more favourable to the UK. However, she will now be mired in domestic political difficulties and will not have the time or the perceived authority to take a lead in Europe. The vacuum will be filled in part by a more pro-EU stance by Mr Macron. Analysts at Citigroup say the euro is being propped up by several factors - including the lack of clarity over German politics right now. Over in Berlin, Angela Merkel arriving for a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace, his official residency. Merkel will brief Steinmeier about the state of the coalition talks (nicht sehr gut!). Steinmeier is then expected to give a statement around 2.30pm local time (1.30pm GMT) Euro volatility has risen this morning, suggesting that traders are more nervous about Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. But...we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re nowhere near the levels seen in April, when Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen were battling for the French presidency, as this chart shows: Kathleen Brooks of City Index suggests the markets may be underestimating the risks from Germany. Volatility spiked ahead of the French election, which turned out to be a boon for markets as Emmanuel Macron was easily elected President of France. The market got the level of risk wrong back in April, and were overly worried, could they be wrong this time and be overly complacent? How this saga plays out in the coming days will be crucial for European traders. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not beyond the realm of possibility that Germany could end up being the biggest political hot potato for the Eurozone this year. A quick reminder of the result of September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election shows why Angela Merkel is in a bind. Having only won 246 out of the 706 seats in the Bundestag, the CDU/CSU needs coalition partners to form a stable government. However, the maths is tricky, as the SPD isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to join another grand coalition. That leaves four smaller parties; but ideological disagreements mean a formal deal with either the left-wing Die Linke or the far-right AfD isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feasible. So a deal with the Greens and the the FDP was the only option. Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform reckons the SPD could help prop up a minority administration. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart of the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp moves against the US dollar this morning: However, the euro is still down 0.5% against the pound, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125. A flurry of headlines from Germany are helping the euro to claw back some of its earlier losses. The Free Democrats have apparently signalled that they could support a minority government made up of the CDU-CSU bloc and the Green party. FDP parliamentary director Marco Buschmann told the Bild newspaper that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are good initiatives, then we are available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prospect of Angela Merkel holding onto power seems to be reassuring investors, even though nothing is clear at this stage. Dutch foreign minister Halbe Zijlstra has warned that the collapse of German coalition talks last night is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbad news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Europe. Zijlstra told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany is a very influential country within the EU so if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a government and therefore don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a mandate it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be very hard for them to take positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Peter Thal Larsen, European editor at Breakingviews, sums up the situation: Political economics professor Henrik Enderlein says Angela Merkel has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriously weakened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with no easy way forward. The possibility that Angela Merkel could be forced out of the German Chancellery will worry the City, says Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investing at interactive investor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European equity markets have picked up where they left off last week, heading lower after the FDP walked out of German coalition talks. Angela Merkel has been the glue that has held the European Union together for the past 12 years, a stable force in turbulent times. Chancellor Merkel is also one of the few European politicians who has demonstrated she may be prepared to compromise with Britain, rather than run the risk that Prime Minister May is replaced by a hardline Brexiteer. With almost unsurpassed political experience, markets will want Germany to find a quick solution, preferably one that leaves Mrs Merkel in situ. Get up to speed every day with our morning email! Ulrich Speck, senior research fellow of the Elcano Royal Institute think tank, says the collapse of the Jamaica coalition talks could be a major moment in German politics, and beyond. The pound is gaining ground against the euro this morning, up 0.25% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1235. Angela Merkel will meet with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, later today to discuss the situation. Steinmeier is a leading figure in the left-wing Social Democrat party - who came second in September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election but refused to enter another Grand Coalition. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services suspects that a minority government made up of Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU/CSU and the Green party might have decent survival prospects, as the SPD could support much of its legislative programme. He adds: As a point of historical note, there is no precedent for fresh general elections so quickly after the previous one. I would not want to second guess this situation, but with Steinmeier being president, and the risk that any or all of the CDU, SPD and FDP take a hammering if fresh elections are held, it might be the compromise outcome. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX stock index has fallen by half a percent at the start of trading in Frankfurt. Postal operator Deutsche Post, financial group Deutsche Bank and industrial giant Thyssenkrupp are leading the fallers. But...energy provider RWE have jumped by almost 4%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Green party would have pushed for coal-fired power plants to be shut down had they joined a coalition. Other European markets have also dipped into the red. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, fears that Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to form a new government could drive markets lower. With this bombshell development heightening concerns over political instability in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy and sparking speculation of fresh elections, the Euro may be in store for further punishment. Although Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging macro fundamentals may offer some background support to the Euro long term, political risk has the ability to trigger further selloffs in the shorter term. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition conundrum puts the whole future of Europe into doubt, says Dean Turner of UBS Wealth Management. He told Bloomberg TV that: The clear risk is that if Angela Merkel was not going to continue as chancellor, what would that mean for Europe? With Emmanuel Macron elected in France, the push to rebuild the Franco-German alliance, to restructure Europe and make new reforms would be put into question. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tobias Buck has a good explanation of why Merkel and the Free Democrats couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach a coalition deal. Among the core differences was the issue of refugee and asylum policy and, in particular, the issue of whether refugees should be allowed to bring their families to Germany. In 2016, at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis, Berlin suspended that right. But the freeze on family reunifications runs out next year, raising the prospect of a spike in new arrivals. The Bavarian CSU, the sister party of Ms Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU, was determined to prolong the suspension, broadly backed by the CDU and the FDP. The Greens, in contrast, insisted that refugees must be allowed to bring their spouses and children into the country, citing humanitarian reasons. Other areas of disagreement were Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to climate change and the Green demand to shut down a significant number of coal-fired power plants, which are among the biggest producers of carbon dioxide emissions. Tax policy, too, was a bone of contention, with the FDP demanding a rapid phase-out of the so-called solidarity tax that is raised to fund the economic development in eastern Germany. Our correspondent in Berlin, Philip Oltermann, says Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader is now under scrutiny, following the collapse of coalition talks. He writes: With talks now seemingly over, Merkel could seek to form a minority government, either with the FDP or the Greens, and gather support from other parties on individual policy votes. The Social Democrat leader, Martin Schulz, whose party has played junior partner to Merkel in the German government for the past four years, ruled out the possibility of another grand coalition under his leadership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The voter has rejected the grand coalition,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schulz said at a party conference in Nuremberg on Sunday. Once all other options are exhausted, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, could dissolve the current parliament and call fresh elections. To get there, however, Steinmeier would need first to set into motion a complicated process that would involve a parliamentary vote on Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as interim chancellor. While the debate in Germany over the past few weeks has mainly focused on policy differences between the parties, it is likely to soon shift to the chancellor, and the question of whether or not she still commands sufficient power to hold together a strong government. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oh Mutti! German politics has been plunged into new uncertainty overnight after Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to form a new coalition collapsed. Overnight, the pro-market Free Democratic Party walked out of talks with Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU-CSU group, and the leftwing Green party. Despite weeks of talks, the FDP, the CDU and the Greens weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to carve out an agreement on migration and climate change. This seems to have scuppered Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of building a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJamaica coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, following September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Investors are watching with considerable interest to see how Merkel reacts. Will she try to lead a minority government, which could hamper her efforts to push through legislation on issues like refugees policy, or Brexit.... Alternatively, she could push for new elections. But that has risks too -- embroiling Germany in a second campaign with no certainty that Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party would do any better than last time (when her majority fell sharply). The financial markets have already reacted, sending the euro down almost half a cent against the US dollar to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.175. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the FDP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to quit coalition talks could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on European politics, and the markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News emerging from Germany that Angela Merkel has failed to form a coalition within deadline has thrown the country into a state of political disarray for the time being, which could have a detrimental effect on the eurozone as a result. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany is renowned for being the economic powerhouse of Europe in recent times, and has consistently contributed to its growth in the first three quarters of this year. Despite the single currency remaining strong for now and the eurozone stimulus programme going to plan, the ECB may choose to approach the situation in Germany with caution until political matters becomes clearer. The German stock market is also expected to drop this morning, as traders in Frankfurt brace for more turmoil. German politics may hog the spotlight today, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much else in the calendar. ECB president Mario Draghi will give his views on the state of the eurozone after lunch, when he appears before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the UK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be enjoying the build-up to Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget on Wednesday. The agenda 2pm GMT: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi testifies to the European Parliament 6.30pm: Bank of England deputy governor David Ramsden gives a speech at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London.",

                "bodyText":"Markets have shrugged off a host of uncertainties - the political outlook for Germany, the budget in the UK, the latest Brexit developments, US tax reforms - to end the day in positive territory. The mood was helped by positive US earnings and housing data, which pushed Wall Street to new highs. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 21.88 points or 0.3% at 7411.34 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.83% to 13,167.54 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.48% higher at 5366.15 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 0.62% to 22,326.44 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex bucked the trend, down 0.32% at 9993.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.61% to 721.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 175 points or 0.74%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US markets are hitting new highs, helped by positive earnings reports and better than expected housing figures. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global stocks are on the rise today, with US indices proving the big outperformer on the day amid further improvements to the corporate earnings picture. With gold and the yen rising in the afternoon, there is an interesting risk-off shift coming in play despite the record highs being set across US indices. This afternoon saw the US economic picture improve once more, with existing home sales beating market expectations in October. The 2% rise in US existing home sales comes as the US gets back on its feet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. US markets have been punching higher in early trade, as they continue to benefit from an earnings season that appears to be the gift that keeps on giving, as home-improvement firm Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seeing a 6.5% year-on-year jump in sales in the wake of recent hurricane destruction. As for the UK, he said: The recent lack of direction in sterling has been a reflection of the largely sideways trade for the FTSE. However, with a growing feeling that the Tory Brexiteers are increasingly open to improving the divorce settlement offer, the likeliness of a December trade talk kick-off seems to be rising. With the UK budget due out tomorrow, the focus on the UK is likely to remain in place, with a heavily housing based speech from Phillip Hammond expected. Meanwhile some positive developments relating to Greece. Helena Smith writes: The European Commission has given the Greek government the green light today to distribute \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.4bn worth of social welfare benefits to citizens worst affected by the gruelling austerity measures Athens has been forced to take in return for bailout assistance. Addressing the European parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and monetary affairs committee, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said as Greece had overperformed fiscally, achieving a primary surplus of 1.75 %, its leftist-led government could honour its pledge to hand out a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to those hardest hit by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long economic crisis. The endorsement by Dombrovskis, a one time harsh critic of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to meet fiscal targets, is a 180 degree volte face from the reaction prime minister Alexis Tsipras received when he announced pre-Christmas \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 handouts last December. In a televised address that took many by surprise last week, Tsipras said the government had decided to more than double the amount it would distribute in the form of a one-off \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year. Among those entitled to the handout are low-income pensioners and unemployed. With auditors representing international creditors poised to return to Athens, Dombrovskis sounded an upbeat note adding : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy is rebounding.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was more than feasible, he said, to conclude an ongoing compliance review - the third since the country received a third bailout from eurozone partners and the IMF - by the end of the year or early 2018. In more optimistic news, the Bank of Greece announced that more than 23.5 million tourists visited Greece between January and September this year - up from 21.4% over the same period last year. Revenues came in at around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn - a godsend for Greeks. Back with the UK, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on Airbus warning MPs about the possible effects of Brexit: Airbus has told MPs that Britain risks losing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crown jewels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its aviation industry to China as a result of Brexit, putting up to 7,000 wing-manufacturing jobs in Wales at risk. The head of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operations warned the business select committee that the threat of new customs bureaucracy and reduced employee mobility could deter long-term investment and accelerate a shift to Asia. Though there are no current plans to move, Katherine Bennett said, adding that she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fighting to ensure that wing design \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the crown jewels of aerospace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remains in this country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I need to let you know, committee, that other countries would dearly love to design and build wings,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told MPs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of them already do; we do build wings in China now, and believe you me they are knocking at the door as a result of the situation we are in in this country. The full story is here: And more positive US economic news. Existing home sales rose by more than expected in October, up 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48m units, helped by a recovery from the disruption caused by recent hurricanes. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised down from 5.39m to 5.37m. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 5.42 for October. The National Association of Realtors, which compiles the figures, said supply shortages were pushing prices higher and making it difficult for first time buyers. The association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Job growth in most of the country continues to carry on at a robust level and is starting to slowly push up wages, which is in turn giving households added assurance that now is a good time to buy a home. While the housing market gained a little more momentum last month, sales are still below year ago levels because low inventory is limiting choices for prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated. The residual effects on sales from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are still seen in parts of Texas and Florida. However, sales should completely bounce back to their pre-storm levels by the end of the year, as demand for buying in these areas was very strong before the storms. US markets have made a bright start, with technology stocks moving higher and pushing the Nasdaq Composite to new highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 140 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.33% higher and the Nasdaq up 0.46%. Higher oil prices and some relatively positive reports from retailers Urban Outfitters and Dollar Tree. But trading volumes were thin ahead of the forthcoming Thanksgiving break. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary of the Bank of England hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, from Oxford Economics: Over in the US, and another positive pointer for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The Chicago Fed National Activity index - an average of several indicators of economic activity - rose from 0.36 in September to 0.65 in October, better than the 0.2 figure expected by analysts. The September number was also revised upwards from the initial reading of 0.17. Markets seem unshaken by the various disappointments around. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the unresolved political situation in Germany, a brewing Tory backlash over the Cabinet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movement on the EU divorce bill, and an unexpected widening of the deficit ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Budget, things were pretty damn quiet this Tuesday. Investors seemed wary of getting too involved with the forex markets. The pound is flat against the dollar and up 0.1% against the euro, while the euro itself effectively unchanged against the greenback, sporadically dipping 0.1%. This forex flatness has allowed the European indices room to breathe. The DAX is up half a percent, ignoring the issues with the German government (or lack thereof) to hit a fresh 8 day high; the CAC, meanwhile, has risen 0.4%, with the IBEX also climbing 0.2%. Somewhat predictably the FTSE couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t muster the same level of energy as its peers, struggling to break 7400 with a meagre 0.1% rise. Looking to the afternoon and the Dow Jones seems set to claw back more of its recent losses, with a 0.2% increase leaving it 20 points away from 23500. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much worthwhile data to contend with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the existing home sales are expected to rise from 5.39 million to 5.42 million \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the focus will likely remain on any pre-Thanksgiving movement in the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax plans. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the UK budget deficit: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit unexpectedly widened in October, handing Philip Hammond disappointing news on the eve of the budget. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by \u00c2\u00a3500m to \u00c2\u00a38bn compared with October a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to improve by \u00c2\u00a3500m to stand at \u00c2\u00a37bn. The figures are likely to frustrate the chancellor as he puts the final touches to his budget speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to be delivered at about 12.30pm on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as they point to a weaker picture than thought for the public finances. Hammond is coming under increasing pressure, including from senior Conservative figures, to increase spending amid widespread dissatisfaction with austerity. The full report is here: Time for a quick recap: Budget Eve has got off to a bad start for Philip Hammond, with new figures showing that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit rose last month. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a38bn in October, up from \u00c2\u00a37.5bn a year ago and almost a billion pounds more than the City expected. The higher borrowing was triggered by a rise in the cost of repaying the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing debts; the rise in inflation has pushed up the yield on index-linked government bonds. City experts say the figures highlights the dilemma facing Hammond. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget may show a rise in borrowing in future years, due to weak productivity. However, borrowing this financial year is still down almost 10%, rather better than forecast in March. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, reckons the bad news will come in the budget forecasts: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen that the weaker pound is helping British factories. New orders have accelerated at the fastest rate since 1988, with manufacturers seeing a rise in exports. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturers are once more performing strongly as global growth and the lower level of sterling continue to support demand. Output growth has picked up again, and export order books match the highest in more than 20 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nonetheless, uncertainty continues to hold back investment and cost pressures remain strong. Manufacturers will be hoping the Budget brings some relief from the business rates burden in particular.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Airbus, the aeroplane manufacturer, has warned that Brexit could force its wing design business overseas. Other countries are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknocking on the door\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, its UK boss says. The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit rose to \u00c2\u00a38bn last month has disappointed some City traders. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says the chancellor would have hoped for a drop in borrowing (as economists had indeed expected). This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the news Hammond will have been hoping for the day before the budget, as the deficit has increased to \u00c2\u00a38.0bn from \u00c2\u00a37.5bn a year earlier. Despite rises in income and VAT receipts and expectations the deficit would narrow closer to \u00c2\u00a37.bn, inflation and the effect it has had on debt costs has caused the deficit to widen and suggests Carney was right to start focusing on keeping inflation under control with his historical interest rate rise. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, says sterling hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been hit, though: Higher borrowing costs due to inflation drove the deficit up, although the effect on the pound has been limited. The deficit figures come as analysts await Chancellor Phillip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget tomorrow. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data highlights the challenge Hammond faces, as many analysts expect a call for more spending as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth weakens. Investors will be watching the pound closely to see how it reacts tomorrow to the budget.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says Hammond will be pleased that borrowing has dropped during this financial year. But.... The more critical issue for the Budget is how public borrowing will evolve in future years. Lower than expected productivity growth is likely to weigh more heavily in the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts tomorrow than the borrowing undershoot this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do expect the Chancellor to retain a reasonable amount of headroom in meeting his medium-term fiscal target, but he is likely to want to retain most of this as a contingency to deal with any future adverse Brexit-related shocks. While we do expect some giveaways in the Budget on housing, health and some areas of public sector pay, we also expect these to be largely offset by clawbacks in other tax and spending areas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, agrees that the next few years will be tough. Hammond is still on target to beat a target of \u00c2\u00a358.3 billion for the 2017/18 financial year. Not bad considering the circumstances. This means that this year Hammond actually still has some room for manoeuvre, however looking ahead to the coming years, his challenge looks set to intensify. The ONS is expected to forecast lower levels of growth for the UK in the coming years. For the Chancellor, this means lower tax receipts and therefore less money coming in. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation also reckons the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headroom is shrinking... Over at parliament, the head of Airbus UK has warned MPs that other countries are keen to lure some of its British manufacturing business. Katherine Bennett told the Business, energy and industrial strategy committee that Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wing design business - its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crown jewels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has won covetous looks from overseas. She also warned that Airbus staff who are EU citizens are very concerned about the future, and whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to work in the UK after Brexit. Airbus employs some 6,000 people at its North Wales plant at Broughton, Flintshire. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Despite the recent surge in orders, UK factory bosses expect growth to slow over the next quarter. A failure to invest in new equipment may be to blame..... Newsflash: UK factories have just reported the biggest jump in new orders since 1988, as the weak pound boosts exports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey of British manufacturing. It found that output rose in the last quarter, with more orders coming in from abroad. Some 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal. That gave a net balance of +17% -- the highest figure since August 1988. The CBI says that orders for food &amp; drink and chemicals rose particularly sharply. Export order books strengthened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notably\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for chemicals, electronics and transport goods. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures are a reminder of the continued failure of both Philip Hammond and Theresa May over these past seven years. The deficit has still not been eliminated as they promised it would be by 2015, and the national debt continues to grow. The rise in the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit over October shows once again that seven years of Tory spending cuts have caused pain and misery for millions with little to show for it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It further highlights why it is so vital that we see a change of course in the Budget tomorrow, halting the growing emergency in our public services and ending their failed austerity policies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will set out a serious plan for the public finances with strategic investment underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to help build a high-wage, high-skill economy for the many not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing figures are another sign that the Brexit vote is hurting the UK economy, says Labour MP Chris Leslie. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmed that rising inflation drove up the cost of servicing the national debt (as explained here). Leslie says it might prompt a rethink about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rather than delivering a huge windfall for public services and our economy, it is clear that Brexit is in fact damaging the public finances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Soaring inflation resulting from the fall in the value of the pound is resulting in rising debt costs. Our NHS and public services are being starved of vital funding. And the Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar chest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 set aside by the Chancellor in March has now been virtually wiped out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor is running out of headroom. Nobody voted to be worse off, or for a weaker economy, and as these new facts emerge people are entitled to keep an open mind about whether this is the right course for our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weakened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd October public finances have denied Philip Hammond a boost ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. But...he also expects borrowing for the full financial year to be below forecasts. Digging into the public finances, we can see that income tax receipts rose by 6.9% year-on-year in October, and VAT receipts rose by 2.3%. But corporation tax dropped by almost 1% compared with October 2016, and revenue from fuel duty dropped by 2.1%. You can see the dataset here. The full public finances report is online here. Bloomberg describe Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. However, they still expect borrowing for 2017-18 as a whole to be lower than forecast. The ONS reports that UK government income, and spending, are both higher than a year ago. In the current financial year-to-date, central government received \u00c2\u00a3394.3bn in income, including \u00c2\u00a3292.7bn in taxes. This was around 4% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. Over the same period, central government spent \u00c2\u00a3420.4bn; around 3% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. Of this amount, just below two-thirds was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence), around one-third on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Maternity Pay), with the remaining being spent on capital investment and interest on government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outstanding debt. Ross Campbell, public sector director at accountancy group ICAEW, says Philip Hammond doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much wriggle room for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Looking at the annual trend, we are still running a large deficit which means our national debt continues to grow. Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics reckons Britain will borrow less than forecast this financial year, despite the unexpected rise in October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit. As this chart showed, the UK has been expected to borrow \u00c2\u00a358.3bn this financial year, up from \u00c2\u00a351.7 in 2016-17. However, the UK has only borrowed \u00c2\u00a338.5bn since April, some \u00c2\u00a34bn less than a year ago. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit jumped last month because the cost of repaying existing government debt jumped in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because some government bonds are linked to inflation, to protect bond-holders from a surge in the cost of living. The retail prices index has hit 4% in October -- as the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote has driven import costs higher. And this is now hitting the public finances, meaning the government has to borrow more (and thus repay more in the future....) As the ONS puts it: In October 2017, the debt interest paid by central government was \u00c2\u00a36.0 billion, while this represents the highest October interest payment on record it remains less than the highest recorded monthly payment of \u00c2\u00a37.2 billion in April 2017. This increase in debt interest payment is largely due to the movements in the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI). Channel 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helia Ebrahimi has tweeted the details: The big picture from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances is that the UK national debt continues to grow. The Office for National Statistics says: Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was \u00c2\u00a31,790.4 billion at the end of October 2017, equivalent to 87.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), an increase of \u00c2\u00a3147.8 billion (or 4.5 percentage points as a ratio of GDP) on October 2016. This is the first time since June that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly deficit has risen year-on-year. This chart shows borrowing this financial year (dark blue) compared to 2016-17 (light blue). So, October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a38bn deficit has eroded the improvement in the public finances since the spring. The jump in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit to \u00c2\u00a38bn last month highlights the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcheadache\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 facing chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, say Reuters. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their first take: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget gap unexpectedly widened last month, underscoring finance minister Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge as he juggles calls for more spending in his budget on Wednesday with the prospect of weaker economic growth ahead. The deficit, excluding state-run banks, stood at \u00c2\u00a38.0bn, up 6.9% compared with October 2016, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. Rising debt costs, linked to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher inflation since the Brexit vote, were a driver of the shortfall. The budget shortfall was bigger than a median forecast of \u00c2\u00a37.0bn in a Reuters poll of economists. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit was bigger than expected last month. The UK borrowed just over \u00c2\u00a38bn to balance the books in October, up from \u00c2\u00a37.56bn in October 2016 (that excludes the impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-owned banks) That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the \u00c2\u00a37bn which City economists had expected. But despite this rise in borrowing, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has borrowed less this financial year than a year ago. Public sector net borrowing since the start of this year has now reached \u00c2\u00a338.5bn, down 9.6% year-on-year. More to follow! In the City, shares in budget airline easyJet have soared to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it reported a surge in bookings. EasyJet may be profiting from the collapse of rival Monarch, and Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent pilot shortage. But...catering giant Compass has slumped by up to 5% despite posting an 18% rise in operating profits. The City may be disappointed by an drop in revenue at its offshore business, which cleans and caters at remote oil and gas extraction and mining sites. Global investors seem to have shaken off the German election crisis. Asian stocks hit a 10-year high overnight, with traders citing optimism over the strength of the global economy. European markets have opened calmly this morning too, with the UK, French and German indices broadly flat. The word in the City this morning is that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is strong enough to shrug off the uncertainty of a second election (if it comes to that). But are things too quiet? Nick Leeson, the man who brought Barings Bank down in the 1990s, suspects there may be trouble ahead.... Even if October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances do beat expectations this morning, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term borrowing needs are still worryingly high. Economists at JP Morgan say Philip Hammond will be batting on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsticky wicket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tomorrow, as the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog) may revise down its growth forecasts. That will have a nasty impact on how much tax revenue the government might take in over the coming years. They write: Next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget will be significant for both economic and political reasons. The OBR is set to downgrade its view of potential growth significantly, forcing the Chancellor to pencil in either more borrowing or more austerity\u00e2\u20ac\u201da particular challenge given the domestic political backdrop. The government lacks an overall majority and is under pressure to increase its financial offer ahead of the mid-December EU summit. The Chancellor is also under pressure to use fiscal policy to offer support to key parts of the electorate amid an ongoing real income squeeze, addressing these concerns while ensuring his budget has enough support in Parliament to pass. JP Morgan thus expect Hammond to absorb any growth downgrades by planning to borrow more over the next few years. This chart shows how the UK monthly deficit has fluctuated over the last two years: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances will be in the spotlight today as we learn how much the UK borrowed to balance the books last month. Economists predict that the monthly deficit will hit \u00c2\u00a37bn, down from around \u00c2\u00a37.6bn in October 2016. A month ago, September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit came in at just \u00c2\u00a35.9bn, the lowest in a decade, thanks to a bumper crop of tax takings. Any drop in the October deficit would be welcome news for chancellor Philip Hammond as he puts the finishing touches to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Hammond faces a tricky task, given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems, and the looming impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. But so far this financial year, the UK has actually borrowed around \u00c2\u00a36bn less than expected. Finn McLaughlin of Capital Economics expects another decent month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing figures: We expect the public sector net borrowing requirement measure of borrowing to continue to undershoot the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast, providing some good news ahead of the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Budget on Wednesday. Indeed, we have pencilled in borrowing of \u00c2\u00a37.0bn in October, just below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outturn of \u00c2\u00a37.5bn, leaving cumulative borrowing 7% lower than last year. However, this will probably be overshadowed by downward revisions to the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for economic growth and therefore the medium-term outlook for the public finances. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank thinks Hammond should use any windfall this wisely... Although Brexit uncertainty hangs over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term outlook, the economy continues to hold up well. Healthy tax receipts so far this year will likely lower projected borrowing modestly in the near term. The Chancellor ought to use this boost to finances to make a stronger commitment to budgetary discipline. Unfortunately, the political barriers between Hammond and this sensible route forward are probably too large. Also coming up today.... MPs on the Treasury committee will grill four Bank of England policymakers over the latest inflation report, and their decision to raise interest rates. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe (who opposed the rate hike) will be accompanied by three external members - Ian McCafferty, Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders. European investors will be watching German politics closely, after coalition talks floundered on Sunday night. Angela Merkel has hinted that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather go through another general election than lead a minority government. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wobbles, the markets look calm this morning as traders await developments from Berlin. In the City, DIY chain Kingfisher, engineering firm Babcock, food producer Compass and budget airline easyJet are reporting results. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK public finances for October 10am GMT: Bank of England policymakers Sir Jon Cunliffe, Ian McCafferty, Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders appear before the Treasury Committee to discuss the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends report for October.",

                "body":"<p>Multiyork Furniture has called in administrators, putting more than 500 jobs at risk.</p> <p>The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes.</p> <p>Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. </p> <p>Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses.</p> <p>The company had net debt of \u00c2\u00a31.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.

                "bodyText":"Multiyork Furniture has called in administrators, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. The furniture maker, which employs 547 people in 50 shops and manufactures upholstered furnishings in Thetford, Norfolk, has struggled amid a tough retail market in which shoppers are shying away from spending on expensive items for their homes. Multiyork had reportedly been put on the market by its major shareholder, the furnishings tycoon Charles Wade of Wade Furniture Group, which also owns beds maker Feather &amp; Black. The two brands are run as separate entities and the administration does not include the bed maker. Administrators said that Multiyork has fallen into financial difficulties as it could not meet its financial liabilities as a result of trading losses. The company had net debt of \u00c2\u00a31.9m at its 2016 year end, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. It recorded a profit of just \u00c2\u00a3479,000 in the 53 weeks to 2 October 2016 after a \u00c2\u00a3714,000 loss a year before. The company increased sales by 5.4% to \u00c2\u00a350.4m, partly thanks to an extra week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading on the year before. The brand, which was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in the village of Mellis, Suffolk, was rescued from receivership by Wade in 1995. Allan Graham of Duff &amp; Phelps, who was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday, said the business would continue to run for a short period as administrators continue to look for a buyer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are asking interested parties to come forward as quickly as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trading conditions for UK retailers continue to be difficult due to a number of factors including economic uncertainty, rising commodity prices, increasing business rates and the fall in value of the pound which has increased the cost of importing raw materials and products,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Graham said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This appears to be leading to a sharp fall in consumer confidence and less money being spent on discretionary items.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The collapse of Multiyork comes after B&amp;Q, John Lewis and online electrical goods specialist AO all pointed to a slowdown in major purchases for the home this week. Redecorating, renovating and DIY projects are being put on hold as household budgets come under pressure in the run-up to Christmas. Sofa specialist DFS, which also owns Sofa Workshop and Dwell, last month revealed a 22% plunge in annual profits as it said shoppers were cutting back on big-ticket purchases. But not all furnishings businesses are suffering. On Wednesday, ScS, one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailers of upholstered furniture and floorings, revealed a 2.9% rise in orders at established stores in the 16 weeks to 18 November. Dunelm also flagged a sales recovery last month, easing concerns after the departure of its relatively new chief executive John Browett. Graham said that the current management of Multiyork would continue to work with administrators to review all orders placed up until 22 November with the intention that all orders would be completed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We ask that customers who have placed orders be patient during this time and you will be contacted with further updates in relation to your order shortly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

We found sellers trading without displaying VAT numbers. Others showed made-up numbers or numbers cloned from unsuspecting legitimate businesses. Relying on Amazon and eBay to warn sellers of their obligations, or to delist offenders, has achieved little. Hammond put the cost to the taxpayer of VAT fraud at \u00c2\u00a31.2bn per year. If such a sum was being leaked via traditional retailers, there would be outrage. The online giants usually grumble that they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be responsible for the VAT compliance of independent sellers. That is disingenuous nonsense. They have helped to create the problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joint liability may make them solve it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap.</p> \n   <p>US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat.

                "bodyText":"US markets may be hitting new highs but it is a more downbeat picture in Europe. Dollar weakness lifting the euro and the pound has hit the main European markets, while Wall Street is benefiting from the currency movements and investor hopes that the Republicans are making progress with their tax returns. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 25.74 points or 0.35% lower at 7383.90 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.46% to 13,000.20 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.56% at 5360.09 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 22,176.70 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex edged up 0.1% to 10,063.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.17% to 724.39 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 26 points or 0.11%. And bitcoin is 2.5% better at $9509. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Oil is on the slide ahead of this Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of Opec, despite talk that the producers will extend their output cut to try and curb oversupply and protect the price. David Madden at CMC Markets says: WTI and Brent Crude oil are in the red today after having a positive run recently ahead of the OPEC meeting on Thursday. There is speculation that major oil producers will extend the oil production cut until the end of 2018. Some dealers feel a lot of that is already priced in and are exiting their long positions ahead of the meeting in Vienna. The US shale producers will be paying close attention to OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, as a surge in the energy market could prompt higher production in the shale sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could counteract OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Brent crude is currently down 0.8% at $63.33 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 2% lower at $57.7. Bitcoin, by the way, is currently up 4% at $9647, although down from its earlier peak of $9721. More on the markets. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Another day, another record high in the Dow Jones, which is playing catch-up with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq after those indices hit fresh records last week. Risk appetite remains healthy in the US but subdued in the UK and Europe, and once again it is strength in the home currencies arising from dollar weakness that is helping to stifle what looked like a strong session earlier in the day. The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap. US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat. Either way, as we head into the final month of the year a sudden pullback due to tax reform worries offers the dip-buyers their best hope. Earlier the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane gave a speech at a Birmingham school about the importance of economics to the general public: European markets have not been able to keep pace with their US counterparts, and are marginally in the red as we head towards the last hour or so of trading. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a pretty scatty, aimless day of trading, with the European indices reversing their lunchtime reversal. Once again the FTSE finds itself back below 7400, falling 20 points having been up by that same amount at midday (and having been down by that same amount just after the bell). The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro likely didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, with cable briefly striking a fresh 8 week peak. However the brunt of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline appears to be coming from the commodity and banking sectors. BP and Shell haven fallen 0.9% apiece as Brent Crude slipped around 1% as it eyes Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OPEC meeting, with the miners stranded in a sea of red. The smattering of losses coating the likes of Barclays, Lloyds and RBS, meanwhile, comes ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test results. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAX followed the same pattern as the FTSE, flitting in and out of the red before settling at a loss this afternoon. The German index is down 0.1% despite signs of political progress in Germany, while its French peer fell 0.2%. As for the Dow Jones, it surged 0.3% this Cyber Monday, crossing 23600 to hit a brand spanking new all-time peak. For those keeping track, the index has rocketed nearly 20% higher since the start of the year (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more if you trace its rise back to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election). Following the strong US housing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved sharply higher and has now also hit a new peak. It is now up 0.3% at 23,628. Some strong housing data from the US. New home sales jumped 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October, the highest level in ten years. New home sales have increased for three straight months, although September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures was revised down from 667,000 to 645,000. Economists had been expected sales to fall 6% to 625,000 in October. No comment: Another day and more records for US markets. Helped by gains for retail shares on Cyber Monday, the S&amp;P 500 has edged up to a new peak of 2604, while the Nasdaq Composite is at a record 6890. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is below the heights reached last week but is still up 0.13% on the day at 23,587. Back with non-cryptocurrencies, and the dollar is slipping back on suggestions that a US rate hike in December may be the last for a while, given last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve minutes showed some reluctance to push borrowing costs too high. So the pound has added 0.3% against the US currency to $1.3382, an eight week high. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said of the dollar: While a December rate move remains a done deal in the eyes of the markets, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what comes after that which is becoming less clear. There were positive views about the jobs market as well as general economic activity across the board, but there were diverging views about the lack of inflation, and it is this uncertainty about US rate policy in 2018 which continues to undermine the currency against the backdrop of a flattening yield curve. Back in the world of shopping, and US retail companies are seeing share price gains in premarket trading, following Black Friday and during Cyber Monday. JC Penney is up 1.8%, Target is 1% better, Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is 1.1% better and the unstoppable Amazon has added 0.5%. What do central banks think of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg has done a roundup of views: Eight years since the birth of bitcoin, central banks around the world are increasingly recognizing the potential upsides and downsides of digital currencies. The guardians of the global economy have two sets of issues to address. First is what to do, if anything, about emergence and growth of the private cryptocurrencies that are grabbing more and more attention -- with bitcoin now surging toward $10,000. The second question is whether to issue official versions. The reaction is mixed, with some warning of the dangers while others - including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Carney - seeing it as a potential revolution. The full report is here. European stock markets are subdued today, following the selloff in China overnight. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all down by between 0.1 and 0.3%, as the pound and the euro gain against the US dollar. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: European markets are tracking Asia lower, as fears grow that Chinese equities could be starting one of their downward legs, which may cause fright for global investors. Chinese equity markets are notorious for delivering a volatile ride for investors, who have become used to boom and bust periods. The China effect is especially significant for commodity markets and by extension the metal and oil heavy FTSE 100. Investors are also looking for signs of progress in Germany, now that the centre-left SPD party is prepared to consider another coalition with Angela Merkel. After its early morning jump, bitcoin is currently bobbing around the $9,600 mark. That leaves the $10,000 milestone firmly in its sights. And some in the industry reckon this could lure more people into buying digital currencies. Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd, told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bitcoin price hike is just the continuation of a long-term bull run on the cryptocurrency, fueled by the tsunami of speculative trading on Japanese exchanges and the entrance of institutional investors across the world. It is more likely that the $10,000 psychological stratosphere will push more institutional investors into the mix.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alternatively, Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent might force financial authorities and central banks to rethink their current policy of waiting to see how digital currencies evolve. In recent months we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a boom in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched into the market - often backed by a celebrity (yes you, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather). ICOs are already under serious scrutiny, due to fears that investor aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly protected. David Futter, fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, predicts that scrutiny will intensify. In the shorter-term regulatory scrutiny will continue to fall on ICOs and the benefits of adapting the existing financial regulation around investments, payments and e-money to drive even more competition while protecting consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge, but have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved. If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thing. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mining\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd network uses more electricity in a year than 19 European countries, including Ireland, according to statistics released this morning. That power consumption is the cost of verifying transactions made using bitcoins, as our technology writer Alex Hern explains: At a continual power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.... The astronomical power draw is a facet of how the bitcoin network protects itself against fraud. With no centralised authority confirming transactions, bitcoin is instead backed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who put specialised computers to work churning through extremely power-intensive computing problems. Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally: Speaking of those stress tests, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video explaining how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks have been put under the microscope. Tomorrow is a big day for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. At 7am, the Bank of England will publish the results of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank stress tests. They will assess whether UK lenders have enough capital to cope with a sterling crisis, a recession, and a housing market crash. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to reveal the damage inflicted on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lenders from \u00c2\u00a330bn of hypothetical consumer loan losses, an economic downturn and a collapse in the pound. Threadneedle Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest health check on the sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first was conducted in 2014 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have an impact on a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pay dividends and on its business models. The lenders could be forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash if they fail the tests based on hypothetical scenarios intended to put the sector under severe stress. You can get up to speed with Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preview, here: Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid ascent towards $10,000 could spur some investors to cash in their gains, suggests the analyst team at FXPro. They write: Currently, the market is anticipating that Bitcoin will reach $10K, with the lack of warning signals down to the lack of any doubts regarding further growth. It begins to seem that big businesses intended to profit from it. If this happens, there is a huge risk that big players start taking profit, with news provoking panic and sell-off. The cryptocurrency market currently seems like a playground for Wall Street tycoons, with JP Morgan Chase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclooking at business opportunities in the planned Bitcoin-futures market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, albeit having labelled Bitcoin \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca fraud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 just two months ago. Once speculation is over, it is very likely that only the real business model projects will remain, such as logistics companies, accountancy or statistics firms reliant on blockchain. There are roughly 16.7 million bitcoins in circulation - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the number mined using special software and hardware. Those coins are now worth $160bn in total (if you accept that a currency can have its own market capitalisation), more than some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major companies. Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a point... Tarzan* has swung into the debate on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial strategy! Lord Heseltine, former UK deputy prime minister, has argued that the best thing for British business would be to cancel Brexit, rather than Heseltine says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply implausible to expect firms to commit fresh investment while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is unclear: Our country is facing years of stagnation, and what is a principal cause of that? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that anyone who has got to take an investment decision today is saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWell how do I know what to invest in? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen about Britain and its biggest market of Europe?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hesitating. Whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re British companies or overseas companies investing here, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hesitating. And as long as we have this Brexit shadow going over us, that will remain. And what do we get in the Budget? A \u00c2\u00a33bn bill in order to prepare for this Brexit disaster. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: * - a reference to Lord Heseltine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive mane and exuberant approach to politics (some readers may remember his antics with the House of Commons mace in 1976) This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how bitcoin has soared this year: Some analysts say it looks like an unsustainable bubble. But Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reckons bitcoin will keep rising as more individuals and investors jump on board. From a fundamental perspective it is still almost impossible to give the cryptocurrency a fair value, however, there has been a strong correlation between the price of Bitcoin and number of users opening new wallets. It is not just retail investors showing interest in the cryptocurrency, but many hedge funds have decided to join the party recently by including Bitcoins in their portfolios. Given that number of users haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exceeded 0.1% of the global population, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still more potential for this momentum trade to continue. Whether the price will be justified in the foreseeable future, depends on the adoption and the application of the new currency, but so far it still looks unstoppable. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is partly due to the established financial world taking cryptocurrencies more seriously. Last month, derivatives marketplace CME Group announced it will start offering Bitcoin futures in December - letting investors trade Bitcoin without actually buying it. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this was a key moment: CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to launch bitcoin futures in December has undoubtedly fuelled buying. BTC is up more than 50% since the decision was announced on October 31st. The legitimacy this gives Bitcoin as a tradeable asset is very important. The market cap of Bitcoin now exceeds that of IBM, Disney and McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But traditional investors still find Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally baffling, with many predicting that it will end in tears. As Wilson puts it: Rather than a commodity or currency, Bitcoin is like owning stock in a company that will only ever issue 21 million shares and never pay a penny in dividends. The only way it has value is if the next guy is willing to pay you more for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the greater fool. With no intrinsic value to Bitcoin, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see this as anything other than a giant speculative bubble.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese stocks may be sinking, but Bitcoin is on a tear (again) this morning. The crypto currency has hit a fresh record high of $9,600 this morning, putting the $10,000 mark within its sights. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a rally - Bitcoin started 2017 at just $1,000, before smashing a series of milestones with remarkable speed. Bullish Chinese investors capitulated this morning, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He writes: China equities are turning lower again, led by financials. This is driven by concerns about rising yields (multi-year highs) amid a bond market sell-off that is likely to raise re-financing costs in an already over leveraged economy, putting pressure on both corporates and consumers, reviving the China credit bubble story. Chinese stocks have hit this lowest level since the summer, as a government crackdown on risky lending spooks investors. The Shanghai composite index fell almost 1% to 3,322 points, the lowest level since 25th August. Traders said jitters in the bond market are hitting Chinese shares, on fears that corporations will pay more to borrow - eating into profits. New curbs on the asset management sector are also driving people to sell, as Reuters explains: Selling in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets last week had been prompted by a rout in the bond market that pushed yields on government treasury bonds to three-year highs, and by fresh moves to reduce risks in the asset management industry that may bring a sea change for banks and millions of small investors. But while bond market jitters appeared to ease on Monday, stock market investors continued to unload shares in major firms that have enjoyed strong gains in recent weeks. This could weigh on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets this morning too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Weak productivity growth is a key reason why Britain faces years of anaemic growth and weak pay. But the UK government hopes to crack the puzzle today, by announcing a new UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Strategy. It will focus on five \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey foundations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- ideas, people, infrastructure, business environment and places, in an attempt to make the British economy fit for the 21st century. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, will launch the strategy this morning. He hopes to make Britain a world leader in areas such as AI and driverless cars. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The paper will identify four grand challenges, global trends that the government sees as shaping the future: artificial intelligence; clean growth; an ageing society; and future mobility from driverless cars to drones. Industrial strategy went out of fashion in the Conservative party after the defeat of the 1974-9 Labour government by Margaret Thatcher. But Clark believes a new approach based on competition rather than on picking winners will help address Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term problems. But will it really be enough to spur Britain forwards? Also coming up today... City investors will be watching Germany closely. Over the weekend, senior officials in Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU party agreed to pursue a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grand coalition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Social Democrats. This could spare Germany from a fresh snap election. Plus, we get a new health check on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 9.30am GMT: Industrial strategy released 3pm GMT: US new home sales figures for October",

                "bodyText":"And finally....Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests showed that UK banks are better capitalised to ride out the next crisis. But should they put that capital to better use? Accenture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Finance &amp; Risk, Peter Beardshaw, argues that they should be more innovative: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banks have come a long way since the crisis and are showing themselves to be more robust when tested against a comprehensive set of scenarios. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just their capital buffers, banks have also heavily invested in being ready for upcoming ring-fencing, MiFID II and PSD2 regulation. So if banks are showing regulators they have a more robust structure, should they now be encouraged to unlock some of that capital and inject it into the economy? Doing so could mean further lending to SMEs or more digital investment for innovating for their customers, and improving their operational resilience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, while banks may be better placed to face problems from the past, they must also be ready for risks of the future. Banks will need to show their resilience when it comes to technology and digital disruption on the horizon, especially as the threat of cybercrime increases and banks get ready for data protection laws.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Brexit dashboard is out! And it suggests that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy picked up a little this month. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The country has kept on an even keel as exporters were bolstered by growth in global trade, while the improvement in the outlook for the rest of the world is helping to offset weakness at home. Households continue to feel the squeeze from inflation, prompted by the weak pound since the Brexit vote, but the rate at which prices rose in the UK stayed at 3% despite expectations of a further increase. Still, questions remain over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with Europe, while Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget revealed a forecast for a slowdown in economic growth for the years to come. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full report: These key charts provide more details: PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Sentance and Dartmouth College professor David Blanchflower have given their verdict: James Hurley of The Times has spotted an interesting new line in the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into Royal Bank of Scotland: The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks could survive a hard Brexit (as long as it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coincide with a wider economic crisis) will have been welcomed by the UK government, as it heads towards a crucial EU summit in December. But any relief should be tempered by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that the City needs a transition deal of at least two years, with no time to lose. Simon Morris, a financial services partner with law firm CMS, says Mark Carney is quite right to warn against a disorderly Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated warnings that a shambolic Brexit stands to damage the UK financial system highlights the need for early Government agreement on the new regulatory landscape plus a proper transition period to adapt to it. Firms need every minute of three years, and not just the 70 weeks left in the Article 50 notice period, to plan around the greatest disruption to the established financial system since the outbreak of war in 1939.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere in the City, hedge funds who bet against online grocery firm Ocado are nursing burned fingers today. Shares in Ocado have surged by over 20% today, after it announced it had secured a deal French retailer Groupe Casino. Under the agreement, Casino will build a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state-of-the-art automated warehouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd based on Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology. Ocado has long been promising that it was working on a major overseas deal with a European retailer. But it has become one of the most \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshorted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks in the City, with speculators betting that it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver the goods.... Lloyds Banking Group are now the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 2.7% at 63.8p, despite passing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests. Barclays are also lagging, down 1.7%, having struggled in the stress tests. Other banks are having a better day, with HSBC up almost 1%. David Madden of CMC Markets says bank shares are a mixed bunch today: Despite been given a clean bill of health, Lloyds, RBS and Barclays are in the red, while HSBC and Standard Chartered are in positive territory. Barclays and RBS were cited as the weakest of the bunch. BoE chief Mark Carney stated the UK banking system can withstand the UK leaving the EU, but a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisorderly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsharp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit could be costly. HSBC and Standard Chartered have far more exposure to emerging markets than they do to Europe, which is helping the share price this morning. City analysts are now giving their verdict on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK bank stress tests. Rob James, co-manager of the Old Mutual Contingent Capital Fund, is impressed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector can stomach losses of \u00c2\u00a350bn if the economy takes a sharp dive. He writes: What is deeply reassuring about this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s test... is that every bank passed. So in answer to that perennial question, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are we nearly there yet?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this time the response is a resounding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The implication is that our banking system can now absorb catastrophic losses, including the continuation of litigation and conduct fines, and still be in a position to supply credit to the economy during the stress. Joe Dickerson, equity analyst at Jefferies, says shareholders shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any big windfalls from the banks, though. Our conclusion is that investors expecting near-term capital distribution from Standard Chartered and Barclays may be disappointed and for Lloyds...investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be heroic about large special distributions in 2018-19. William Anderson Jones, Head of UK Corporate Dealing at RationalFX, says the stress tests should reassure investors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK banks have proven that they would be able to withstand a disorderly Brexit, as results of recent stress tests have shown today. BoE Governor Mark Carney confirmed that all of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks were able to pass their most rigorous examination yet, testing their ability to withstand a financial crisis. The resilience of the banking system will prove a reassurance to investors, as the outcome of Brexit remains unclear. The pound has shown little reaction, remaining mostly steady after reaching an eight-week high against the dollar yesterday. Good news! The global economy is picking up momentum, thanks to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broad-based and synchronised improvement in growth rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic outlook. It predicts the global economy will grow by 3.6% this year, 3.7% in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019 But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news too -- Britain will lag behind other major economies over the next few years. The OECD says: In the United Kingdom, the growth slowdown is expected to continue through 2018, due to continuing uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations around the decision to leave the European Union and the impact of higher inflation on household purchasing power. So the OECD expects UK GDP to rise by 1.5% this year (down from 1.6% previously). Growth will then slow to 1.2% in 2018 (up from 1% before), and then 1.1% in 2019. In contrast, the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2017, 2.1% in 2018, and 1.9% in 2019. Today is a very busy day for UK banking journalists, as they chew through the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests and financial stability report. These are detailed documents that deserve proper analysis. And yet... the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City watchdog, has decided to publish the final summary of its report into how small business owners were mistreated by Royal Bank of Scotland. This report was commissioned in 2014, and finished in October 2016. The FCA has been under pressure to publish it, following allegations that RBS had put struggling businesses into its Global Restructuring Group and then deliberately mistreated them. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine why they thought this would be a good day to release it, though.... Anyway, the final summary is online here. The inquiry has found that Royal Bank of Scotland was guilty of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It says the bank failed to support small businesses to recover, and was too focused on raising fees to cut its own debts. RBS also failed to handle complaints properly. Some of those failings were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as RBS failed to manage the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conflicts of interest inherent in GRG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twin objectives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, helping distressed businesses, and recovering the money they owed RBS). But, the inquiry didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that RBS had deliberately tried to drive firms into its GRG division so they could be pillaged. So, is this the end of the matter? Possibly not, judging by this enigmatic line in the report: The FCA has been conducting a general investigation into matters contained in the report which we announced in November 2016. We have now decided to carry out a more focussed investigation. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks can withstand a series of economic shocks including a no-deal Brexit that would have more severe impacts than what they experienced during the global financial crisis, the Bank of England said on Tuesday. While concluding that lenders can deal with Britain crashing out of the European Union without a deal and restrictions imposed on British business, the Bank of England warned that additional problems may emerge if a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disorderly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit takes place at the same time as a sharp global recession. In its annual stress test of the sector, the central bank said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lenders, such as Barclays and Lloyds Bank, were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resilient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a raft of adverse scenarios, including deep simultaneous recessions at home and abroad and hefty falls in the price of assets. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the severity of the tests, for the first time since the bank began stress testing in 2014, no bank needs to strengthen its capital position as a result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Santander UK say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pleased with the stress test results: Once again, Santander UK had the lowest stressed CET1 ratio impact of all participating firms, demonstrating our resilient balance sheet and low risk profile. [CET1 = Common Equity Tier 1, a measure of a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength] Twitter have collated the best tweets about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test results: Our City editor Jill Treanor reports that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests showed that the UK banking sector could survive a bad Brexit outcome: High street banks can withstand a disorderly Brexit, the Bank of England has said, even though Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays struggled in its latest health check on the sector. For the first time since 2014, when Threadneedle Street conducted its first annual stress tests, the major lenders have not been required by the UK central bank to raise billions of pounds more of capital to strengthen their finances. But RBS, 70%-owned by the taxpayer, and Barclays only passed the hurdle rate set by the Bank because the regulator took account of efforts they had already made to increase their financial strength since the end of last year, when the tests were applied. The Bank of England is alert to the risks poised by Brexit, and in its half-yearly review of risks to the financial system warns that a disorderly Brexit coupled with a severe global recession and more multibillion pound fines from global regulators could force it to reconsider its assessment. Guardian: High street banks \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan cope with disorderly Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katherine Griffiths points out that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tests were pretty tough: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big banks can withstand a hard Brexit and still keep lending but Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland struggled to pass the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stress tests. The seven biggest lenders passed a stress test that was as tough as if the UK crashed out of the European Union, the Bank said, with sterling slumping, interest rates rising to 4 per cent and a record housing crash. All seven lenders passed but Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland struggled. Barclays emerged with the smallest headroom. The Times: Big banks can cope with hard Brexit Over in the FT, Caroline Binham and Martin Arnold flag up that the BoE is making banks strengthen their financial positions: The Bank of England is forcing UK banks to hold an extra \u00c2\u00a36bn in capital to guard against risks beyond that of Brexit, as it called on the UK and the European Union to introduce legislation to avoid a post-Brexit crisis in derivatives and insurance markets. The BoE said on Tuesday that it is raising a special buffer half a percentage point, to 1 per cent, to lock in capital that banks are currently holding voluntarily. The aim is for lenders to better withstand against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd macroeconomic risks beyond Brexit, such as global debt levels, asset valuations and misconduct costs. The buffer could raise again next year, the central bank warned. A disorderly Brexit is unlikely, the BoE forecasts. Financial Times: BoE demands extra \u00c2\u00a36bn buffer from banks; calls for new post-Brexit derivatives rules Iain Withers of the Daily Telegraph points out that shareholders would suffer if the banks incurred hefty losses. The report showed that in the stress test scenario all but Nationwide would stop paying out a dividend within three years, and the building society would pay out just \u00c2\u00a3100m. While this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test did not explicitly model a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario, the Bank said it was sufficiently severe to give it confidence the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system would keep lending to the real economy even in a disorderly exit from the EU. However the report warned politicians on both sides of the Channel to take several important actions to reduce the risks from Brexit, including agreeing a swift transition period and passing legislation to resolve potential contractual conflicts on trillions of pounds of derivative contracts. Telegraph: UK banks can weather chaotic Brexit but RBS and Barclays in worst shape, says Bank of England The press conference wraps up with another warning from Mark Carney that a no-deal Brexit would be undesirable for everyone involved. Q: Is the Bank of England concerned about the row at the London Stock Exchange over its leadership? Mark Carney replies that the LSE plays an important role in UK financial stability. Its CEO Xavier Rolet has made an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary contribution....but everything comes to an end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit mystified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the row over Rolet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s succession. [Explainer: Rolet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure was announced last month. It has since emerged that he had been asked to step down by the board, after falling out with chairman Donald Brydon. Activist investor the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investment Fund is now demanding that Brydon leaves, and Rolet stays on #developing #popcorn] Q: Are UK banks being too complacent about the impact of Fintech, by assuming they can cut costs while maintaining market share? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the challenge, Carney replies. UK banks are assuming that they can use new technology to bring down the cost of acquiring new customers. From next year, it will be easier for customers to shift accounts. And that could mean that some banks become less \u00e2\u20ac\u0153front-facing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as new challengers reshape the industry. The City has taken the stress test results in its stride. Shares in HSBC and RBS are up a little, while Barclays and Lloyds have dipped. Mary Carney is reiterating that UK banks could handle a hard Brexit -- but there could be trouble if they also faced a wider downturn. Q: Are you concerned about the state of the UK mortgage market today? Mark Carney says the FPC have put several restrictions in place in recent years, to prevent lenders from making unduly risky loans. Those measures seem to be working. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests also found that buy-to-let mortgages would suffer the bulk of the losses if there was a financial crisis. Loans to owner-occupiers would be much more modest. In other words, families would keep paying off their mortgages even if the economy went into recession, but some buy-to-let lenders might struggle to meet their obligations. Q: Who will bear the biggest burden from a disorderly Brexit, UK households or the banks? We hope that the banks bear the burden, Carney grins. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they have capital reserves, to cope with tough times. The governor says: What we want...is that people who could get mortgages prior to that event can still get mortgages. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a good business ides you can still get funding post-Brexit. But at disorderly Brexit would still have an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic impact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on households and businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be some pain associated with that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carney concludes; the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is to dampen that pain. Q: Do regulators on the continent understand the dangers of a disorderly Brexit to the EU? Carney says there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased appreciation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of these issues on the continent, and the Bank is in regular contact with EU officials about these issues. He singles out the risks of cross-border insurance and derivatives contracts -- these issues can be fixed, but they take time, he says sternly. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack nails it: Q: Will next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests include a specific test for a disorderly Brexit? No, says Mark Carney. In 12 months time it will be too late. Q: What is the impact of a disorderly Brexit on the banking sector, compared to an orderly one? Mark Carney explains that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests modelled a huge recession -- with growth slumping, unemployment tumbling, and the pound shedding a quarter of its value. Under that scenario, UK banks lose \u00c2\u00a350bn of capital - but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sunk by those losses. So... a disorderly Brexit wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any worse than that. Carney says the Bank is putting its money where its mouth is, as it would be called on to support the UK banking scenario if Brexit goes badly. He warns: This [a disorderly Brexit] is not a good scenario... it is one we are all working to avoid as it has some quite material economic costs, even if the financial system continues to operate through it. Q: Are overseas investors already losing faith in the UK? The UK has tremendous strengths, Mark Carney replies. But you need a strong \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bedrock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to encourage investors to keep putting money into Britain. Q: Why do you think a disorderly Brexit would be unlikely? Mark Carney says there were several reasons. That includes the fact that all parties are working towards an agreement, and have said it would be in the best interests of both sides. Governor Carney also warns that individual banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolve the huge number of derivative contracts between the UK and other EU countries (totalling some \u00c2\u00a320 trillion) We need secondary legislation to guarantee contract continuity - both in the UK and the EU - he adds. Onto questions...and straight into Brexit. Q: How long does a Brexit transition period need to be, and how soon to we need it? Carney says the minimum transition period is 18 to 24 months (ideally the latter), and it needs to be agreed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sooner the better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Bank of England also tested how UK banks would cope with the disruptive impact of Fintech. The banks themselves say they are well-positioned to cope. But the BoE reckons that new technology could have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153profound consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on incumbent banks. They include: A rise in the cost of recruiting customers, which could hit market share A rise in the cost of raising equity - which is bad for profitability. On Brexit, Mark Carney says the Bank of England focused on the scenarios that would have the biggest impact on UK stability, even if they are unlikely. And....the Financial Policy Committee judged that UK banks could continue to support the UK economy, even in the event of a disorderly exit from the EU. But.... Carney adds that banks would struggle to cope with a hard Brexit AND a global recession at the same time. If a series of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly unfortunate events happened simultaneously\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, capital reserves would be run down and banks would restrict lending to the real economy, the governor adds. BoE governor Mark Carney says that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well-placed to provide credit to households and businesses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd even if they suffered recessions in the UK and abroad, large asset price falls, and hefty fines for misconduct. [reminder: here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the tests covered] Carney confirms that that banks would lose \u00c2\u00a350bn in the first two years of the scenario - enough to wipe them out 10 years ago. This time round, he says, they are strong enough to cope. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is facing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (bleary eyed) banking reporters*, to discuss the stress test results. You can watch it live here: * - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been locked in the Bank since 5am Lloyds has issued a statement, confirming that it has passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test. Barclays has also put out a statement, which points out that its results were dragged down by the possibility of fines from banking regulators for misconduct. An element of the 5.0% drawdown in the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 stress test reflects litigation and conduct issues which Barclays is aiming to resolve. Barclays continues to target an end state CET1 ratio of around 13%, although it may temporarily run above that level until these legacy issues are resolved. Standard Chartered says that it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnotes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it has passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests, adding; The Group has a strong and liquid balance sheet and these results demonstrate the benefits of the actions recently undertaken by the Group to improve its resilience to an extreme stress scenario. Reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference is flooding in. Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Ewen Stevenson, says his company is making progress, but admits it has more work to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to make progress towards the stress resilient bank we aspire to be. 2017 represented another year of material improvement with our peak-to-trough stress resilience improving by 300bps from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test. Until we have resolved our remaining major legacy conduct issues and non-core portfolio interests, we will continue to show stress test results weaker than our long term targets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays failed to meet the pass mark in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests, based on their end\u00e2\u20ac\u20182016 capital positions. But... they still passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tests, because they have bolstered their capital positions during 2017. The 2017 UK bank stress tests are online, here. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, set up to assess risks to the financial system, had judged that: The UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit. However the combination of a disorderly Brexit and a severe global recession and stressed misconduct costs could result in more severe conditions than in the stress test,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Bank said. Threadneedle Street confirmed that banks would be required to hold an extra \u00c2\u00a311.4bn in capital by next November, but will now review whether they will need to build an additional cushion in the future in light of the potential risks in the system. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said: The FPC is taking action to ensure the financial system is resilient to a very broad range of risks so that the people of the United Kingdom can move forward with confidence that they can access the financial services they will need to seize the opportunities ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official confirmation that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks have enough capital to withstand a new financial crisis. Importantly, the Bank of England has also found that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks could cope with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disorderly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit without having to curb lending or be bailed out by taxpayers. Here we go! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven largest lenders have passed the tough stress test posed by the Bank of England. This is the first clean slate since the tests were created in 2014, and suggests the sector is in relatively decent shape to survive the next recession. BUT! Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland only passed because they have raised fresh capital during the course of 2017. More to follow! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests model the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doomsday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, says Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Will Martin. And here it is: In the UK economy, the BoE modelled the effects of a sharp recession of more than -4% GDP. This is accompanied by the pound collapsing to just $0.85, a fall of about a third from current values. Global growth is also hit, with banks tested on how they would cope with a worldwide contraction of 2.4%. This scenario also includes a collapse in Chinese commercial real estate of more than 40%. As a result, unemployment in the UK climbs higher than during the financial crisis. Commercial lending collapses, leading to disaster in the property market. House prices fall by 33% and commercial real estate loses 40% of its value. The Daily Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Iain Withers compares today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests to classic computer game Sim City..... He writes: Fans of the blockbuster Nineties PC title SimCity 2000 will remember it as a fiendishly addictive city management game. Players built roads, homes, offices, shops, factories and utilities in what proved a surprisingly popular simulation of life as a city mayor. Sometimes the game would suddenly trash your city with an alien invasion, to test your mettle. A massive black metal spider-like creature would pop up on the screen and start razing parts of your lovingly crafted metropolis with laser beams. There was little you could do other than hunker down, wait for the alien to leave, put out the fires and rebuild. I fear today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s test may not be quite as much fun, though Good morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to discover if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector is strong enough to survive a new financial crisis. Bank of England has put the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven biggest lenders through a series of rigorous tests to see how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d cope if the economy hit the rocks. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests model a serious financial downturn, at home and abroad. They examine if banks have enough capital to handle a sharp fall in UK and global growth, a surge in consumer bad debts, a plunge in the pound, and a jump in unemployment caused by higher interest rates. It will also test their long-term financial resilience. The seven lenders are Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operations, and the Nationwide building society. The results are released at 7am GMT, and will show which banks are best, and least, prepared for the next recession. Banks whose exam paper comes back covered in red ink will face tough questions about their resilience. Any lender who actually fails the test forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash. Last year Royal Bank of Scotland fell short, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be under particular scrutiny this year. A poor performance could undermine the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to sell its majority stake in RBS. We already know that the lenders will suffer \u00c2\u00a330bn of losses on consumer loans under the tests. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results will show where those losses are concentrated. Adding to the fun, the Bank of England is also releasing its latest Financial Stability Report this morning. That will show the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the UK financial system, and the key threats to financial stability. Our City editor Jill Treanor is locked in the Bank of England, reading the stress test now ahead of 7am. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her preview: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 7am GMT: UK bank stress tests released 7.30am GMT: Bank of England governor Mark Carney holds a press conference. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discuss the stress test results and the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report 10am GMT: OECD releases its latest economic outlook 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for October 2.45pm GMT: Federal Reserve chair nominee Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation hearing at the US Senate",

The drug has been been credited with revolutionising treatment for male impotence and reducing stigma surrounding the condition since its commercial launch in 1998 but has become a popular target for criminals. Announcing its decision on Tuesday, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it hopes the move will stop men seeking to buy it from unregulated websites. While prescriptions of Viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs containing sildenafil have tripled in Britain in a decade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were 2,958,199 prescriptions in 2016, compared with 1,042,431 in 2006 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is still a large black market. Last year, \u00c2\u00a317m worth of unlicensed and counterfeit Viagra was seized. The manufacturer, Pfizer, said it hopes that Viagra Connect will go on sale over the counter in pharmacies in spring next year. It will be available in a four-tablet pack and eight-tablet pack, with recommended retail prices of \u00c2\u00a319.99 and \u00c2\u00a334.99 respectively. Mick Foy, the MHRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s group manager in vigilance and risk management of medicines, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care, and do not feel they need to turn to counterfeit online supplies which could have potentially serious side-effects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The MHRA said the decision was made after a safety assessment, advice from the Commission on Human Medicines, and positive responses to a public consultation earlier this year. Its investigators have have seized more than \u00c2\u00a350m of unlicensed and counterfeit medicines for impotence over the past five years. Since its commercial release in 1998, the famous blue pill, which was a failed treatment for angina, has been used to improve the sex lives of millions of men worldwide. It has opened up conversation about male impotence, although some say it has become a lifestyle drug. Pfizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patent ended in 2013 but it has earned the pharmaceutical giant more than \u00c2\u00a31bn a year. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK medical director, Dr Berkeley Phillips, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand some men may avoid seeking support and treatment for this condition, so we believe giving them the option to talk to a pharmacist and buy Viagra Connect could be a real step forward in encouraging more men into the healthcare system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As erectile dysfunction may be a sign of an underlying condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, there could also be a wider benefit to public health in the long term. We hope that this forthcoming new opportunity to purchase a genuine treatment via pharmacy will also reduce the likelihood of men turning to potentially ineffective and dangerous counterfeits from illicit sources.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Men wishing to buy it will be required to consult the pharmacist, who will determine whether it is appropriate for the patient, outline possible side-effects and suggest a consultation with a GP if deemed necessary. Viagra Connect will not be sold to men with severe cardiovascular disorders or at high cardiovascular risk, or to patients with liver failure or taking certain interacting medicines. In such cases they will still have to see their GP. Pfizer also recommends that pharmacists should advise all men to follow up with their doctor within six months of first being supplied the product. Dr David Edwards, a GP with a special interest in sexual dysfunction and a past president of the British Society of Sexual Medicine, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my clinical experience a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to attain and maintain an erection is of paramount importance to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When erection difficulties do occur, emotional and physical closeness between a man and his partner can diminish, leaving a man with a sense of isolation and lacking confidence in day-to-day life. A new initiative that enables men to go to a pharmacy to get help for their erectile dysfunction is welcome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

And yet the OECD outlook (which comes via consultation with the Treasury) offers a slightly more pessimistic outlook for the economy than we had in the May budget. There is a bit of fudging because the budget uses financial-year projections and the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are for calendar years, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OECD projects for GDP is just 2.8% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019, while the budget projected 3.0% growth in 2018-19.

But the OECD does forecast stronger export growth and lower unemployment. Where the May budget projected an unemployment rate of 5.5% in 2018-19, the OECD has it falling to 5.4% next year and 5.3% in 2019. But the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendation for the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates is one that does not fit with much of its own commentary about wages growth and inflation.

In September the market was pricing in almost two interest rate rises by the start of 2019, but by the end of October this had fallen to an expectation of one rate raise by the end of next year and a slight chance of another rate rise in the middle of 2019. And now there is only about a 50% chance of a rate rise by December next year: There is unlikely to be a change in these expectations on the basis of any projections in the OECD report. The report, for example, notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under-employment has edged higher and wage growth and inflation remain steady\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It also suggests that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some highly indebted households could face financial stress when interest rates rise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that household indebtedness and signs of a cooling housing market are keeping consumer sentiment relatively soft.

And yet it then bizarrely suggests \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the other hand, a stronger pick-up in wages and incomes could result in higher consumption and growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Well, yes, but nowhere does the report suggest that is about to happen. Indeed, the link of under-employment and wage growth is well noted, given the very strong relationship between the two measures over the past decade and half: Currently the under-employment rate is at a record high of 8.7%. For private sector wages growth to return to the 3% the May budget predicts for 2018-19, history suggests it would need to fall to around 7.6% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 140,000 fewer people under-employed. The OECD also notes that the housing market is cooling due to expectations of rising interest rates and the macro-prudential regulations that have limited investor lending, and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising household indebtedness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keeping consumer sentiment relatively soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Certainly our household indebtedness is rising \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to the record level of 194% of household disposable income. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 26% points higher than it was five years ago: Given this level of debt, it is odd to think that raising interest rates would result in higher consumption growth. As ever, the OECD also advocates for tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including lowering the company tax rate. But crucially, it is within the context of shifting our dependence on tax from income to consumption taxes and it recommends broadening the base of the GST. Such a move would unlikely do much to promote consumption growth and at any rate is politically dead, given the main way to broaden the GST is to put tax on fresh food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very regressive move that would require significant outlays to compensate poorer households: The OECD report for Australia has a positive outlook almost in spite of itself. The growth projections are a mixture, but overall no better or worse than was estimated in the May budget but the OECD sees good times ahead. And yet its major recommendation that the Reserve Bank should increase interest rates despite evidence of ongoing weak inflation and wages growth is one that would likely undermine that rosy outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if it were to occur while our under-employment levels remain at record highs.",

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses.</p> <p>The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a1ed95657470105e957519c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-29T16:06:51.081Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a1ed9e79ab3f2056cb1d8d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-29T16:06:41.502Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress.

                "bodyText":"A mixed day for Europe, but with little real movement on most of the major markets. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved higher after positive remarks on the economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, but technology stocks have come under pressure. Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, told Reuters: What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing is a combination of defence positioning, with people taking some profit out of the high-growth areas, technology specifically, and rotating into sectors that should hold up better if we get any negative news on the tax bill or debt ceiling. Meanwhile bitcoin is currently up nearly 9% at $10,741 although off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs of 11,395. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 67.09 points or 0.9% at 7393.56 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.02% to 13,061.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5398.05 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 22,325.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.22% better at 10,267.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.67% to 738.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 67 points or 0.28%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. But there are some less positive developments in Greece, too. Helena Smith writes: In Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil court, police have fired rounds of tear gas and been engaged in hand to hand battle with protestors opposing first electronic auctions demanded by creditors in bid to finally deal with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountain of bad bank loans. Over in Greece, some positive developments. The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn, writes Helena Smith: Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a huge development ... and of huge significance for the country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses. The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end. One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%. Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. She made positive noises about the US economy, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This makes a December rate rise even more likely, which has helped banking shares, and more increases could follow. Yellen said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is continuing its surge higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a relatively sluggish few weeks the Dow has burst into life in the last couple of sessions. Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up another 80 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress in pushing through his \u00e2\u20ac\u201c increasingly unpopular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate. What goes up... Bitcoin is now at $10,479, down from its peak today of $11,395 but still up from the $9,868 it opened at. Back in the UK, the national minimum wage received by the lowest-paid workers is in the spotlight. The Low Pay Commission, which recommends the minimum wage rates, said in its annual report published this morning that the new rates for 18-20 and 21-24 year olds follow the biggest rise for both age groups in a decade. We already know the rates, which were published last week as part of the budget, but analysis in the report that shows increases from 1 April 2018 of 4.7% and 5.4% respectively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will benefit between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the largest up-rating since 2007. A lower percentage rise has been applied to the National Living Wage (NLW), which covers those aged 25 years old and beyond, of 4.4 per cent. Forecasts for average earnings growth next year fall between 2.5% and 3% the commission said. The weakest rise is being handed to 16 and 17 year olds, who must survive on \u00c2\u00a34.20, up 3.7% on this year. The commission said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new rates will boost the earnings of between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly, and many more young workers will benefit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is for two reasons: firstly, these increases lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspillover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effects further up the pay distribution; secondly, even though they are not entitled to it, some young workers benefit from increases in the NLW. We estimate that up to 45% of 18-24 year old workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or 1.3 million young people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could receive a higher pay increase than they would have done in the absence of the NLW.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boom! The US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both climbed to new levels, following the upgrade in US growth in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, sums up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second estimate of US GDP shows the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is clearly firing on all cylinders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If Donald Trump takes his fingers off the retweet button, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll notice that the US economy appears to be doing pretty well on his watch. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics on the new growth figures: Third-quarter GDP growth was revised up modestly to 3.3% annualised, from 3.0%, thanks to a stronger positive contribution from business investment and a much smaller drag from State and local government expenditure. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers was revised up as well to 2.5%, from 2.3%. Business investment growth is now estimated to have been 4.7% annualised, with equipment investment up by 10.4%. With borrowing costs still relatively low, confidence strong and capex intentions surveys at elevated levels, we expect another decent gain in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin just smashed through $11,000, defying the doubters with their taunts about tulip bulbs.... Despite its summer surge, the US hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grown quite as fast as the eurozone over the last year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortably outpacing Britain, though.... Economists are cheering the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 3.3% (annualised) in the last three months. This upward revision suggests the US is in decent shape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: BREAKING: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2017. Fresh figures from the Commerce Department shows that US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.3% in July-September, up from a first estimate of 3.0%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equal to a quarterly growth rate of over 0.8% -- twice as fast as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% in Q3. The new data shows that corporate profits boosted growth, jumping by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter. Net trade also boosted growth, with exports up by 2.2% but imports down by 1.1%. Reaction to follow.... German bank Berenberg has raised their forecasts for UK growth over the next couple of years, on optimism that a hard Brexit can be avoided. They say: We raise our calls for real GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 to 1.8% and 1.9% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, following modest increases to our growth projections for household consumption and business investment. Our forecasts exceed Bloomberg consensus (29 November 2017) of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. We see risks to the growth outlook as roughly balanced. Foreign exchange news site DailyFX flags up that the pound has outperformed other currencies against the dollar today: The price of bitcoin is going up even faster than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential Brexit bill. The cryptocurrency smashed through the $10,000 mark overnight, and is currently changing hands at $10,900. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risen by around 1,000% during 2017. Five years ago, you could have bought a bitcoin for only $12.... The higher bitcoin goes, the louder are the warnings that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unsustainable speculative bubble. But then, I can remember the same warnings back in 2013! Sir Jon Cunliffe, the BoE deputy governor, has suggested that potential bitcoin investors should be cautious. He told BBC Radio 5 this morning that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a currency in the accepted sense. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no central bank that stands behind it. For me it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more like a commodity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not at a size where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to Brexit, and the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katya Adler reports that some EU officials are irritated that the \u00c2\u00a350bn settlement hit the headlines last night. Although they do want money from the UK, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be bounced into an agreement. They also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that any payment will guarantee Britain the post-Brexit deal it wants... She writes: If and when an agreement on the Brexit bill is made, the EU will push back hard at UK government assertions that Brexit financial payments be tied to a future trade and transition deal. Brussels insists this is money the UK owes - dating back to commitments made on annual and long-term budgets while an EU member. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not blood money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an EU civil servant told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is money the UK must pay on leaving the EU. The new relationship post-Brexit Britain will have with the EU is something quite separate. Europe is not about to be blackmailed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from Brexit briefly, shipping company Clarksons has admitted it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hacked. Clarksons told the City that it has been working with the police since discovering a cybersecurity incident which involved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unauthorised access to the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer systems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It warned shareholders that those responsible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may release some data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today. Andi Case, CEO of Clarksons, has hinted that the company refused to pay the hackers to return stolen data, saying: I hope our clients understand that we would not be held to ransom by criminals, and I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have understandably raised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More evidence that the eurozone economy is ending 2017 on a high, from the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest health check: Despite Brexit uncertainty, individuals and businesses in Europe are increasingly optimistic. New data from the European Commission shows that eurozone consumer and economic confidence jumped again in November, to their highest level in 17 years. Newsflash: UK households reined in their borrowing last month. Unsecured consumer credit (such as borrowing on credit cards) grew by 9.6% in October compared to a year ago, down from 9.8% in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest rise since April 2016, and follows concerns that people were being driven into debt by rising inflation and falling real wages. New Bank of England figures also show a fall in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, down to 64,575 in October from over 66,000 in September. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has defended the government against criticism that it might stump up \u00c2\u00a350bn to leave the EU. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme that the UK has financial obligations to settle, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think people in this country would expect us to just walk away from things we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already said we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bonus marks to anyone who spotted that on the side of a bus last year. Anyway, Andrew Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster today: The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has sounded a cautious note about the \u00c2\u00a350bn figure. Collared by reporters in Berlin this morning, Barnier suggested that a deal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed yet. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are still working. ....I am working for an agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has rallied against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all of its 16 major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rival currencies this morning, reports Bloomberg. Even if a \u00c2\u00a350bn bill is agreed, Britain faces several hurdles to jump before it can avoid a disorderly Brexit. As well as the Irish question, Brussels also wants commitments on EU citizen rights beyond 2019. Plus, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that parliament will approve a hefty divorce bill. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital says: First, can Theresa May sell this to voters and to her party. She seems to have some shaky consensus backing for a higher offer but this is contingent on getting a good trade deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the EU will not have its hands tied in this way. Therefore we must be wary that the political consensus to pay a bigger bill could unravel; and paying a big bill does not by definition lead to a good trade deal. Capitulating to the EU in this regard carries its own risks for Theresa May, but the risk of a no-deal exit was ultimately too high. Second, the Irish border is still a major stumbling block and it is uncertain whether sufficient progress has been made on this front. This is an even more sensitive topic than the divorce bill and is not as easy to solve with a bigger cheque. The third key barrier for the EU is citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights and again it is unclear if there is sufficient progress in this regard. Sterling has jumped by 1.4% against a basket of currencies, its biggest rise since April, according to Reuters data. Christmas has come early for Brussels, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank wryly. He expects an official agreement on the Brexit bill next month, following the news that the UK has caved in to demands for a \u00c2\u00a350bn payment. We expect UK PM Theresa May to present a formal offer on the Brexit bill, EU citizens rights, and the Irish border question at the upcoming 4 December dinner between May and EU Commission president Juncker. We expect the offer to meet the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirement for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsufficient progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the Brexit divorce. If such progress is made, expect the UK and the EU to move negotiations on to potential transitional arrangements and post-Brexit trade at the 14-15 December EU Summit. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit bill is only one part of the Brexit puzzle, of course. We still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any idea how the Irish border question will be resolved; Dublin could block negotiations on trade unless its fears over a hard border are assuaged. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Picking up the Brexit bill has been the very thorny issue since day one and given that now the government has agreed to a respectable amount, the talks between the UK and the EU (which are set to resume next month) should be smoother. If the EU accepts the bill, then we will be moving to the next hurdle which is securing the EU rights [of citizens living in the UK. It is important to keep in mind that we are no way close to be out of the woods when it comes to the smooth negotiation process because the Northern Ireland issue is still the thorny matter. The pound is continuing to climb against the US dollar as investors bet that the Brexit fog is clearing. As Stephen Gallo at the Bank of Montreal put it (via the FT): It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buy! The risk of snap election is down, the risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is down, the path to a transition deal is clearing. The surge in the pound has hit shares in the City. The FTSE 100 is down 31 points at 7429; a stronger sterling reduces the value of money earned overseas by UK-based multinationals. The prospect that Britain and the EU might shake hands on a Brexit bill next month is exciting the City this morning. \u00c2\u00a350bn is obviously a lot of money, even if split over many years. But traders think it could be worth it, if it opens the door to trade talks. Konstantinos Anthis of brokerage firm ADS Securities explains: Even though the agreement is not yet formal traders are clearly excited by the prospect of progress on this issue. Traders are looking for any positive news in this area as it opens the way for trade negotiations, and are prepared to buy sterling in response. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Sterling is on a roll this morning, amid signs that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit breakthrough. The pound has jumped to $1.3406, up almost three quarters of a cent, to its highest level since the end of September. It is also pushing higher against the euro, up 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. The rally was triggered by reports that London could pay a \u00c2\u00a350bn exit bill, in an attempt to nudge European politicians into starting negotiations about trade. A deal would ease fears that Britain could crash out of the EU in March 2019 in a disorderly Brexit. EU leaders will decide next month whether this is enough to move negotiations onto trade, so this could be a very significant moment. As my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin reported last night: Non-stop behind-the-scenes negotiations have led to a broad agreement by the UK to a gross financial settlement of \u00c2\u00a389bn on leaving the bloc, although the British expect the final net bill to be half as much. A senior EU official told the Guardian that the UK appeared ready to honour its share of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpaid bills, loans, pension and other liabilities accrued over 44 years of membership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have heard the UK wants to come along with the money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the official said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have understood it covers the liabilities and what we consider the real commitments. But we have to see the fine print.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bill could total \u00c2\u00a353bn to \u00c2\u00a358bn (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65bn), although EU officials are not discussing numbers and the British government will fight hard to bring the total down. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking City reaction to the news, along with new data showing the state of the UK, US and eurozone economies.

He said, the decision has been unanimous, a solid decision to extend deal through December 2018. It is basically a one year agreement, he said, tweaking the language to strengthen agreement.</p> <p>He said inventories were expected to decline to the desired targets in the second half of 2018.</p> <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect supply surprises in 2018 as we saw in 2017, he says. But supply from other regions remains unknown, he says, especially shale producers from the US. We will be agile and respond as events unfold.</p> <p>The issue of Libya and Nigeria surprised market in 2017. There was constructive consultation with their leaders, they have an interest in market stability. We wish them the best. Both countries have told us their 2018 levels will not exceed what they achieved in 2017. So to the market we say there are no surprises expected from them.</p> <p>The six observing countries have also endorsed the agreement.</p> <p>We are very conscious the state of the global economy is impacted by volatility in oil prices. </p> <p>I feel extremely optimistic about short and long term outlook for oil. If I have a concern, it is that investment should flow back into the industry sooner rather than later.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

                "bodyText":"Breaking news: Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih has confirmed that the agreement on curbing output will be extended. He said, the decision has been unanimous, a solid decision to extend deal through December 2018. It is basically a one year agreement, he said, tweaking the language to strengthen agreement. He said inventories were expected to decline to the desired targets in the second half of 2018. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect supply surprises in 2018 as we saw in 2017, he says. But supply from other regions remains unknown, he says, especially shale producers from the US. We will be agile and respond as events unfold. The issue of Libya and Nigeria surprised market in 2017. There was constructive consultation with their leaders, they have an interest in market stability. We wish them the best. Both countries have told us their 2018 levels will not exceed what they achieved in 2017. So to the market we say there are no surprises expected from them. The six observing countries have also endorsed the agreement. We are very conscious the state of the global economy is impacted by volatility in oil prices. I feel extremely optimistic about short and long term outlook for oil. If I have a concern, it is that investment should flow back into the industry sooner rather than later. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude is currently up 0.4% at $63.37 a barrel, as Opec and non-Opec producers (Russia being the key member of the latter) agreed to extend their output curbs until the end of 2018. But West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped 0.5% to $57 a barrel. Reuters is also reporting that a delegate has said that Opec and non-Opec members have agreed the extension at the afternoon meeting. Contrasting fortunes for US and European markets. Hopes that the Republican tax plan will be passed, along with a rebound in technology shares, has helped lift Wall Street to new peaks. But European shares slipped back as the euro held up, and the FTSE 100 similarly fell back on sterling strength against the dollar. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.9% or 66.89 at 7326.67 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.29% to 13,023.98 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.47% at 5372.79 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.55% at 10,211.0 But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.19% 22,368.29 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.26% to 740.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 208 points or 0.88%. Meanwhile bitcoin, having hit 11,395 late on Wednesday, is now down 5.75% at 9259. Now there will be a group photo and then the meeting will continue in private. The positive trend in the market is driven by good fundamental metrics, says Novak. We are continuing to see inventory draws, a significant decline in volatily and investment returning. We are also seeing....good demand growth. However, to reach our goals, to rebalance the market, we must continue to act jointly and take us further into 2018 and have a co-ordinated approach to that. Both consumers and producers are waiting to see what we will announce today. I am hopeful we will arrive at a joint conclusion. The key player among the non-Opec countries is of course Russia. Its energy minister Alexander Novak says the joint efforts are benefiting the whole global economy. We deliberated on the extension of the agreement at the Opec meeting this morning, and this will now be deliberated with our non-Opec colleagues, he says. We must continue to work in unison and stay the course. (Opec members have reportedly agreed to extend the output curbs from March 2018 to the end of the year, but this needs now to be agreed by non-Opec participants.) Demand is on firm ground, he says, and there has been 100% compliance to the target by Opec and non-Opec members. We are heading in the right direction but we are not where we want to be, we must remain focused, he says. The meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is making his opening statements, saying the declaration a year ago was a landmark achievement and has helped the oil industry recover. He says many thought it would might not affect market conditions, but the effects are self evident. The Opec and non-Opec meeting is about to start shortly and can be seen live here. The press conference will apparently follow afterwards. The pound has continued its gains against the dollar and is now up 0.8% at $1.3515. This is the first time sterling has been higher than $1.35 since the end of September. The currency is benefitting from growing hopes that some key Brexit agreements will be made, but there are also some US developments which are denting the dollar. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, says: The dollar lost a step this afternoon as news broke that Donald Trump is looking to get rid of Rex Tillerson as State Secretary and replace him with CIA chief Mike Pompeo. In the aftermath of the reports cable saw its gains widen to 0.8%, lifting the pound above $1.35 for the first time since the end of September, while the euro rose half a percent and the yen erased its early losses. All this is presumably because investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too happy to see further signs of discord in the Trump government just as progress is being made on the tax bill. The Dow Jones, on the other hand, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too fussed by the news, rising half a percent after the bell to a brand spanking new all-time high of 24070. That marks around a 500 point surge since the start of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, and a 21% climb since the year began. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed above 24,000 for the first time. A rebound in technology stocks and continuing hopes of progress with the Republican tax cut plan have combined to send US markets higher. The Dow is currently up 132 points at 24,073 while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.36% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.4%. The pound has just hit a new nine-week high against the US dollar, at $1.3494. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says optimism over Brexit is helping sterling: The pound is continuing to dine out on the signs of Brexit progress, with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reports of a divorce bill agreement joined by a rumours that the UK and EU are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclose to a breakthrough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the Irish border issue. Over at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury hotel, energy reporters are tucking into a range of delicious nibbles: That platter does have a certain 1970s feel about it. Perhaps Opec is harking back to its glory days, when it could impose an oil embargo on America and send gasoline prices soaring. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Bitcoin has continued to drop, to below $9,200. That means whoever bought the cryptocurrency at yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs has lost around $2,000 per bitcoin. Some photos from the Opec meeting have landed: Cailin Birch, Commodities Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that oil producers are losing their enthusiasm for output cuts. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Political will to maintain the quota system is beginning to wane among some OPEC countries and some non-OPEC partners, including Russia. Global oil prices have held over US$60/b for over a month now, a level that was unimaginable earlier this year. Global oil stocks are beginning to decline, closer to the five-year average range. As a result, some key producers appear to be interested in ending the production-cut deal sooner rather than later, in an effort to preserve market share. But despite those concerns, she still expects a deal today: The EIU considers it to be more likely that the cuts will be extended through to end-2018, with an option to review this agreement at mid-year -- a nod to some partners less willing to stay on board. Although the global market is beginning to tighten, oil supplies remain comfortable and US output continues to rise; this means that continued restraint by OPEC will be necessary to erode global stockpiles further. Bloomberg are reporting that a deal to extend Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cuts by nine months is in the bag. Ministers are now discussing how to review the situation next June. The oil price is rallying, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loud hints from Opec that production cuts will be extended at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Vienna. Brent crude has jumped by a whole dollar per barrel, or 1.6%, to $64.11. Traders are anticipating that the oil cartel will extend its current output curbs for an extra nine months, to the end of 2018 -- following the Opec call for everyone to stick together. But the oil market can be a volatile beast (although rarely in the bitcoin league!). So if Opec disappoints, we could see prices fall sharply. Craig Erlam of trading firm Oanda reckons a nine-month extension is largely priced in: Only a more aggressive cut is likely to provide any substantial upside, although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be much appetite for such action given the progress that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been made and the market share that is being conceded to US shale as a result. Financial traders are fascinated by Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild gyrations, says City Index. Given the current price action of the cryptocurrency, headlines are easy to come by, and yesterday was no different. The virtual currency gained over 15% in the early part of the day, charging through $10,000 to a fresh all time high of over $11,000, before plummeting as much as 21%, with incredible speed to $9009. Whilst traditional assets are experiencing historically low levels of volatility, the whipsaw action of the bitcoin is drawing the attention of traditional traders. Meanwhile existing traders and new comers are increasingly interested in fear of missing out. Bubble or no bubble, there is nothing to say the price can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go up further. With more interest from professionals, from the mainstream, and Nasdaq also announcing plans to launch bitcoin futures, the virtual currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legitimacy has grown exponentially which is reflected in its price increase. Bitcoin has rallied over 1100% since the start of the year and 100% in the last two weeks. But with these size of price increases, a hefty downside should also be expected. Bitcoin is falling out of bed again. The cryptocurrency has now tumbled $9,500, a loss of $1,000 compared to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s height. It looks like a repeat of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, when the cryptocurrency plummeted shortly after crashing through the $11,000 milestone. Even so, Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains this year are extraordinary; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quadrupled since the summer. But still, these wild fluctuations do suggest that bitcoin has bubbly tendancies. Speaking of bubbly... apparently you can buy a second-hand gold Rolls-Royce (complete with a rear refrigerator and champagne flutes) using bitcoin: Robert Chote, who runs the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, says there are several reasons why migration into the UK has slowed, including the slump in the pound. But... the push factors have also weakened. Economist Douglas McWilliams points out that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been creating more jobs recently, giving people less reason to look abroad. Stephen Clarke of Resolution Foundation says the drop in potential workers will hurt some UK companies: But Home Office minister Brandon Lewis argues that the system is working: Migration into the UK from Europe has slowed sharply since the Brexit vote last year, as fewer people come to Britain looking for a job. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that net migration into the UK fell to 230,000 in the year ending June 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the largest annual decrease ever recorded, down from +336,000 in the previous 12 months (running up to the EU vote). Over three-quarters of the decrease in net migration can be accounted for by EU citizens. The number moving to the UK fell by 82,000 to +107,000, which the ONS calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a statistically significant decrease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those immigrating with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153definite job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd remained stable (187,000); while the number of people coming to the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking for work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fell by 56,000 to 74,000. Again, much of the decline (47,000) was due to EU citizens. Reaction to follow.... Newsflash: Unemployment in the eurozone has hit its lowest level in almost nine years. The euro area jobless rate has dropped to 8.8%, the best reading since January 2009, as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continues. Germany still has one of the best unemployment rates, while France, Italy and Spain are all lagging. Al-Falih also touches (briefly) on environmental issues. He says Opec should give climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due attention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continually engage on environmental issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (while still pumping millions of barrels of oil out of the ground each day to be burned or turned into plastic, presumably). The press pack have now been shooed away from the oil ministers, and the Opec meeting is formally under way. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Khalid Al-Falih is chairing the meeting, as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president. He says that Opec has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come a long way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the last year towards rebalancing the oil market, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot more needs to be done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Al-Falih cautions that the energy market is entering the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd period. But, the medium to long-term outlook looks healthy as the global economy strengthens. Al-Falih urges members to stick together, rather than bowing to the temptation to pump more oil than is permitted under the output cuts deal. History says that as you get closer to the goal, commitment wavers. I call on you all to stay the course, rather than relying on others. In the long term, Al-Falih says that oil producers must invest in new infrastructure to ensure oil production in the future. Ot oh..Bitcoin is losing some of its earlier gains, and is now back at $10,075. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 2.5% so far today. A scrum of TV cameras have swarmed around Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister. Khalid Al-Falih says that he believes Opec should continue its current policy of curbing oil output, to get the market back into balance. We should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue the process that has worked so well in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Al-Falih declares. He adds: We are not complacent. We are going into 2018 half done. We need all of 2018 to get the job done. Al-Falih also says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to talk about Opec exiting its production cuts. But he does suggests that the cartel could reassess the situation next summer: Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister says that $60 per barrel is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - a sign that the Iranian government is happy with the production cuts deal. Across the room, Kuwaiti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has told reporters that he supports a nine-month extension to the cuts deal. NEWSFLASH: Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has dropped a strong hint that Opec will agree to extend production cuts by nine months today. Khalid A. Al-Falih has told reporters in Vienna that the existing deal is working well, and there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect alignment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between Opec members. Al-Falih adds oil producers shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ease off until the market is healthier. He personally favours a nine-month extension - and hopes that other members will back this idea too. The Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anjli Raval has the details: The Opec meeting is open, and journalists are racing into the room to quiz energy ministers.... Newsflash: Iraqi officials have said they support extending Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output curbs deal until the end of next year. Russia isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an Opec member, but it can still play a key role at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. A year ago, Russia threw its weight behind the oil output curbs drawn up by Opex. That deal took 1.8 million barrels per day out of the market, helping to push crude prices up this year. For today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal to be a success, Opec needs Russia to stay on board. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says Moscow has reservations over the deal - but will probably back an extension today. Kapadia says: Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin recently indicated that their economic growth in October was negatively affected by their deal with OPEC. The Economy Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are the first by a senior Russian official giving a negative assessment on the deal where Russia agreed to cut output by 300,000 bpd compared with its level in October 2016. These comments are understandable given Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy oil dependence. However, they should arguably be willing to take some short-term pain to gain the benefit of medium term price gains. The country lost out heavily during the oil price collapse in 2008-09 and mid-2014. We expect the country to accept and cooperate over the cutback extension at the OPEC meeting in Vienna The Opec meeting is being streamed live, here. The reporters covering Opec are keeping warm by huddling together in a stairwell, waiting to be allowed into the meeting. Brent crude has risen by 0.5% this morning, to $63.45 per barrel. Several delegates are hinting that Opec will indeed extend its output curbs by another nine months today. Hopefully the Opec delegates remembered their hats and gloves. The chatter in Vienna is that Opec will agree to cut oil output for an extra nine months. The current production deal expires in March - but ministers are now considering extending it until the end of 2018. If so, that could nudge the oil prices higher (with the caveat that other producers can simply pump more) Reuters explains: While there has not been an official statement, OPEC and Russia seem ready to prolong their oil supply cuts until the end of 2018. The cuts were put in place last January and are set to expire next March. However, an extension may include a review in June should healthy demand amid ongoing supply restraint overheat the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC loves leaving an ace card up their sleeve, they will never give everything away (in advance),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai. ANZ bank said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anything less than a nine-month extension to the current production agreement could see the recent sell-off accelerate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling has hit a new nine-week high this morning, driven by hopes that the UK and Europe will hammer out a Brexit deal. The pound is trading at $1.34, the highest since 26 September. Investors are hopeful that the two sides will reach agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexit bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next month, and move onto trade talks. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says sterling is getting a Brexit boost: Optimism that our Brexit negotiators can do a deal at December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit and move onto crucial post-Brexit trade talks, is greater now than it has been. Wild also advises bitcoin traders to tread cautiously, after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility. Believe in it or not, bitcoin is worth over $10,000 again. Cryptocurrency land\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme volatility is like catnip to high-risk traders, and even traditional investors are dipping their toe. Given there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no logical way to value them with any accuracy, this remains Wild West stuff. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild swings have left some experienced City figures a little baffled. Martin Gilbert, co-CEO of Standard Life Aberdeen, was on Bloomberg TV this morning, and asked if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been buying crypto-currencies. Gilbert denied it, saying: I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know how to buy it. Even by bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usual standards, this is turning into quite a dizzying week. Last night, the crypto currency plunged by 20% (!) after hitting a fresh record high over $11,300 yesterday. Bitcoin is still looking skittish this morning, surging back up to $10,618 before subsiding. All terribly exciting, but not perhaps what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for in a currency. As an asset class, you need strong nerves to trade it. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for the energy market. Over in a chilly Vienna, oil ministers from the Opec group of energy producers are gathering for a crucial meeting. Opec must decide whether to extend their existing production cuts agreement, and for how long, in an attempt to remove excess capacity and support oil prices. The existing deal, agreed a year ago, seems to have succeeded. Brent crude has risen from $56 per barrel to around $63 in the last 12 months. But with competitors such as shale and renewables lurking, Opec will probably decide to extend the production curbs. But for how long? Six months? A year? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the meeting could move the markets. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main event is expected to be the OPEC meeting in Vienna where it is expected that oil ministers will extend the output freeze by another 9 months, until the end of 2018. That is certainly what a ministerial committee of oil producers recommended yesterday, however that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop oil prices continuing their recent slide lower ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. There appear to be some concerns that Russia might well throw a ratchet into the gears, particularly in the context of the length of the output extension. There has been some concern that an extended freeze could well leave the field open to US shale producers who are already pumping at record levels. Therefore the biggest question isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around an extension, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about how long the extension lasts for. We should know later today. European stock markets are expected to be calm, as traders await developments in Vienna. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching bitcoin, after it surged through $11,000 yesterday only to fall back sharply. Plus, we get new eurozone inflation and unemployment data this morning. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am GMT: Opening session at the Opec meeting in Vienna 10am GMT: Eurozone inflation data for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment data for October 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 4pm GMT (approx): Opec decision",
