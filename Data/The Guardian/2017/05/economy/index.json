                "bodyText":"Many financial experts are concluding that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to raise interest rates in June, given the language in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: This is Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets writes: The FOMC statement was hawkish and the Fed has clearly given a message to the markets that they think the weakness in the economic data is only temporary. This means that the Fed is more than happy with their current strategy and more rate hikes are coming this year - at least for now. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital predicts that Fed official will start dropping hints of a June rate rise soon - if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really getting ready, that is.... The Fed is in no rush to raise rates too quickly as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fully aware that rising inflation is less of a threat than tightening too fast, noting that it will stabilise around its 2% target. On the whole, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision changes very little in the assessment for monetary policy. All eyes now on the minutes from the meeting and jawboning from officials in the coming weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics points out that the US jobs data (starting on Friday) will be crucial... On balance, we still think that the Fed will hike again in June, although that assumes employment growth rebounds in April and May. The drop off in core inflation is a concern, but the global economic backdrop is much stronger than it was last year. Furthermore, although the Fed hiked rates twice since late last year, financial conditions have actually loosened, with the dollar and bond yields both falling, while stock markets have performed strongly. A late newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has left interest rates on hold. The Federal Reserve also predicted that the slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 was probably only temporary. That could be a sign that the Fed could raise interest rates in June. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement looks quite hawkish, with US policymakers pointing out that the US jobs market looks solid, firms continue to invest, and inflation is close to its target. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed. Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined. Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid. Business fixed investment firmed. Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent longer-run objective. Traders on Wall Street like the look of the statement, sending shares up: With better than expected eurozone GDP figures, markets managed to edge higher for the most part. Exceptions were France, ahead of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential debate later, and the UK, with investors unsettled by the increasing testy relations between the country and the European Union. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 15.52 points or 0.21% at 7234.53 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.16% to 12,527.84 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac fell 0.06% to 5301.00 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.13% to 20,759.31 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 10,837.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 2% to 748.61 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 21 points or 0.1% lower. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Sterling has slipped back after Theresa May accused the EU of attempting to influence the outcome of the UK general election. The pound, which had earlier climbed as high as $1.2949 against the dollar, is currently down 0.26% at $1.2902. Jameel Ahmad, vice president at FXTM, said: While the British Pound has hardly tumbled as of writing, the comments from Theresa May on Wednesday afternoon do go some way towards disclosing how strained relations with the European Union have become after invoking Article 50, and the risk of them becoming worse are significant when you consider how tense the negotiations with the EU are likely to get over the next two years. Follow the latest political developments in our live blog here: US crude inventories dropped last week, but not as much as analysts had been forecasting. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks fell by 930.000 barrels to 527.77m, but this was below forecasts of a 2.3m decline. But gasoline stocks rose by less than expected, up 191,000 barrels compared to an expected rise of 1.3m barrels. US crude prices have reversed earlier gains following the EIA update, and are now down 0.7% at a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low of $47.32 a barrel, the lowest since the end of March. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what some of the respondents to the ISM report said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business level increasing. More project inquiries are being received.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beginning of Q2, business is profitable, maybe a bit slower than anticipated. Opportunity still positive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stable activity.

The ISM non-manufacturing PMI rose from 55.2 in March to 57.5 in April, better than the expected 55.8. The new orders index jumped from 58.9 to 63.2, but the employment index was at its lowest level since August. The US service sector unexpectedly rose in April, according to the first of two sector surveys. The Markit services PMI came in at 53.1, compared to the initial reading of 52.5 and the final March figure of 52.8. The composite reading - manufacturing and services - rose from 53 in March to 53.2. US markets have fallen back in early trading, not helped by Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest update showing a surprise drop in iPhone sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 35 points or 0.17% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.27% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.34%. Apple itself is down around 1.6%, losing $12bn off its market capitalisation of $773bn. Meanwhile, the latest service sector surveys from both Markit and ISM are due shortly. Following the US private employment numbers, analysts are looking forward to the official non-farm payroll figures on Friday. And there could be a bounceback after last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment, some believe. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: ADP for April showed the US added 177,000 private payroll jobs, pretty much as expected. Last month the ADP number beat expectations by around 80,000 jobs. This led many analysts to upgrade their forecasts for the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Non-Farm Payrolls. But these missed even the unrevised predictions by over 70,000 raising concerns about the outlook for this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number. The expectation is that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was a seasonal aberration, so the hope is we get a strong bounce-back in the data in two days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. The current forecast is for a gain of around 200,000 after the 98,000 recorded in March. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danske Bank on the US jobs numbers: Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies created 177,000 new jobs last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on the 255,000 created in March, and the lowest private sector job creation figure since October. The figures come from payroll firm ADP. This sets up Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, the wider measure of the US labour market. Economists predict that around 200,000 new jobs were created overall, after March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointingly weak 98,000. European stock markets are still in the red, with the FTSE 100 down 22 points, or 0.3%, at 7227. Wall Street is expected to follow suit in 80 minutes time: Economists are predicting that the eurozone will have a decent 2017, following the news that GDP grew by a healthy 0.5% in the first three months of this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction.... Shilen Shah, Bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the political headwinds facing the Eurozone in 2017, it produced a decent GDP print for the first quarter at 0.5%. In contrast to the more tepid performance in the UK and US, the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance does suggest that rest of the year is likely to be solid given the supportive PMI prints. Despite some tightness in the German labour market, the relatively high level of unemployment for the Eurozone as a whole would indicate that there remains a significant amount of spare capacity, suggesting a period of above trend growth is possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ING Bank are also upbeat: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital..... One UK construction firm isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing too well today. Shares in Galliford Try have slumped by over 9% today, after the company revealed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking a one-off charge of around \u00c2\u00a398m on two large building projects. CEO Peter Truscott says the loss is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that the company won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t undertake large infrastructure jobs on fixed price contracts anymore. Lesson learned.... Over in Athens, a shot has been fired across the bows of the Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakthrough agreement in talks with creditors. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports. While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called for a cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next moves, criticism is already mounting in the ruling Syriza party. Senior leftists are emphasising that there is little to be joyful about following the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest cave-in to creditors. Nikos Filis, the former education minister and highly regarded Syriza figure, has gone so far as to express doubt that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153counter-measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd struck by the government to offset losses that pension cuts and tax rises will inevitably engender, will work at all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The preliminary agreement for the conclusion of the second review marks the country remaining in the suffocating memorandum,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote, referring to the onerous bailout programme Athens has signed with lenders. Describing the prospect of counter-measures being applied as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dubiously positive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said it was far from sure that poorer Greeks who will be most affected by pension reductions and bigger taxes would be relieved by any measures in the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not sure that they are enough to heal the pain that will continue to exist for the weakest social strata,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added in the article published in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syntaktwn newspaper. The government has said that by 2019, when pension cuts will be applied, a support programme will also be enforced for more vulnerable Greeks. The criticism was echoed late Tuesday by the Parliament Budget Office which warned that in the uncertainty of the long-stalled second review, it was now far from certain that Greece would achieve a projected growth rate of 2.7% this year. That would in turn expose the country to multiple risks, it said in its quarterly review. Following the concessions the government had been forced to make to close the review, the body quipped that Greece was in danger of falling into an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity trap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which constant tax increases and shrinking expenditure ultimately chip away at gross domestic product and increase the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already massive debt load. Anyone getting over-excited about the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery should remember that it also started 2015 and 2016 strongly, but then faded over the summer. Economist Rupert Seggins has the details: Cathal Kennedy suspects that Germany outperformed the wider eurozone in the first quarter of 2017 (and also beat the UK). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the GDP report: If the large euro area economies, only France and Spain publish growth estimates in advance of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release. Taken alongside those, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggregate euro area number suggests that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German release will show expansion in the region of 0.7% q/q in Q1. Early survey data for Q2 is consistent with the current pace of growth continuing into the second quarter. The April \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMIs are up on their, already elevated, Q1 average while the Economic Sentiment Indicator also rose from its Q1 average of 107.9 to 109.6 last month. Disappointingly, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until 12 May to find out how Germany, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest member, fared in Q1. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid-looking growth figures do suggest that the eurozone recovery is on track, raising the changes that the European Central Bank rethinks its current ultra-loose monetary policy stance. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: Eurozone growth was a healthy 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017, which matched the upwardly revised fourth-quarter 2016 performance. No component breakdown was provided of the first-quarter Eurozone GDP, but we expect the healthy growth was very much domestic-demand led, with consumer spending and business investment playing a key role.... the healthy first-quarter Eurozone growth performance reinforces belief that the ECB will likely drop the reference to lower interest rates in its forward guidance at its June meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Breaking: The eurozone recovery continues! GDP across the single currency grew by 0.5% in the first three months of 2017, new figures from Eurostat show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than the UK, which only grew by 0.3%, and the US, which expanded by less than 0.2% in Q1. And in another boost, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate for the last three months of 2016 has also been revised up to 0.5%, from 0.4%. This surely reinforces hops that the European economy has entered a period of stronger growth, as fears of political instability and debt crises receded. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now.... Experts are warning that British builders are worried about Brexit, even though construction output accelerated last month: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As these figures reflect, the sector is currently in relatively confident mood with the next few weeks of uncertainty leading up to the general election seen by many as a reasonable trade-off given it will result in a government in place until 2022. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, some of the nervousness is coming from contractors with a focus on infrastructure, where the pipeline remains strong. The success of Crossrail has shown that mega-projects can be delivered on time and on budget but there are concerns about how government decision-making on infrastructure may be affected given the focus on Brexit negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A further worry is skills and the fears over future access to EU workers, on which the UK construction industry is so reliant. Here, firms are continuing to use joint ventures to spread risk, share labour resources and ensure the best possible teams are available for the job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite recent robust performance across construction, we expect the sector to see anaemic growth in the short to mid-term as concerns about falling inward investment levels, thinning long-term order books and access to skills grow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome of the Brexit negotiations will be particularly key for construction, given its reliance on migrant labour and raw materials from overseas. Further rises in input costs due to more expensive recruitment and import costs will squeeze margins that are already under pressure, pushing up the strain on prompt payments across the supply chain and potentially the number of business failures in the industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The construction sector is looking resilient, says Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the biggest rise in new orders since the beginning of the year, the sector is in a strong pre- election position buoyed up by a hardy UK economy and strong client confidence. The housing sector offered up the best news recovering from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minor blip and building on its strongest performance since the end of last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment growth rose to its highest since May 2016, though continued disquiet about the lack of highly-skilled labour availability persisted and which must be addressed if the future strength of the sector is to be assured. Combined with the vexatious conditions of rising commodity and labour costs, low stocks of essential materials and longer delivery times frustrated buyers and added drag to the completion of planned projects. UK builders are also pretty upbeat about their prospects over the next year, suggesting little concern over Brexit. Markit says: Around five times as many survey respondents (49%) expect a rise in construction output over the year ahead as those that forecast a fall (10%). The degree of confidence was down fractionally since March, but still well above the post- referendum low seen in July 2016. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector expanded at its fastest pace in four months in April, as the construction industry picks up steam. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has jumped to 53.1 from 52.2 in March. That beats forecasts of a small fall to 52.0 (any reading over 50 shows growth). The pick-up was driven by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faster rises in civil engineering and residential building activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Markit. Builders reported that they took on more staff last month, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained improvement in client demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meant they had more work to deal with. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says construction growth picked up last month despite weaker demand for commercial construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey reveals a positive start to the second quarter of 2017, with a robust upturn in civil engineering activity helping to boost the construction industry. There were also more encouraging signs from the house building sector, as growth recovered to its strongest so far this year. However, the performance of the commercial building sector remained subdued in the context of the past four years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK construction companies noted that the resilient economic backdrop helped to drive up client spending in April. Greater workloads led to the fastest pace of job creation since May 2016 and a continued squeeze on sub-contractor availability Sterling has been rather volatile this morning, as the latest shots in the Brexit battle trouble traders. The pound lost half a cent in early trading, following a report in the Financial Times that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill for leaving the EU could be \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn. It then recovered back over $1.29, after Brexit minister David Davis declared that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll not be paying 100 billion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and ruled out going into negotiations as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supplicant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale warns: Renewed concerns about Brexit have put sterling on the back foot, at least for now. After hitting 20-month highs on Tuesday, European stock markets have dipped in early trading. Traders are holding fire until the eurozone growth figures flash up in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: That inertia is partly informed by investors waiting for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter GDP reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is forecast to rise to 0.5% from Q4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before making any significant moves. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are also taking an early morning hit. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost almost 3%, after the supermarket chain reported that profits fell to \u00c2\u00a3503m in the last 12 months, down from \u00c2\u00a3548m a year earlier. CEO Mike Coupe says it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pivotal year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which included the takeover of catalogue chain Argos. That deal already seems to be paying off. Argos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like-for-like sales jumped by 4.1%, while Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fell slightly. City analysts are worried that the core business looks sluggish John Ibbotson, director of the retail consultancy Retail Vision, says Argos is turning into a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclifeboat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the rest of the group: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Argos has so far proved an effective \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcget out of jail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 card for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But with inflation biting into consumer spending and the latest retail sales figures showing that the consumption boom is waning, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s must get its core business in order before it comes off its catalogue crutches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other surprise corporate news, Marks &amp; Spencer has snaffled Halford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive to revitalise its struggling clothing operation. Jill McDonald will join M&amp;S in the autumn as managing director for clothing, home and beauty. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest piece in CEO Steve Rowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround plan. Last year M&amp;S suffered its worst fall in clothing sales in a decade, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty for McDonald - who calls herself a longtime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153M&amp;S customer and professional fan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - to sort out.... Halford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investors won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy, though - shares are down almost 4% in early trading. Big news in the City this morning: Adam Crozier, the boss of ITV, is leaving after a seven-year stint at the broadcaster. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done a good job too, EBITA profits are up over 300% on his watch, and the shares have quadrupled thanks to the success of shows like Downton Abbey and X Factor. He also bought Mammoth Screen, which created the hit television series Poldark that was broadcast on BBC. Speculation has been swirling for some time that Crozier might be off; ITV reportedly hired headhunters in January to find a successor for the former head of the Football Association and Royal Mail. But ITV haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet announced his successor, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have just dropped by 2.2% at the start of trading. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Crozier, who led a turnaround at ITV after the post-credit crunch recession and successfully reduced the broadcaster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliance on advertising revenue by building up its production arm, said he planned to build a portfolio of roles in the next stage of his career. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director, Ian Griffiths, will step up to a new combined role of chief operating officer and finance chief and run the company for an interim period, while the chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, becomes executive chairman during that time. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After years of slow growth, austerity and bailout drama, is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy now rattling ahead? We find out at 10am BST when eurozone GDP figures for the first three months of this year are released. Economists predict that the euro economy grew by a punchy 0.5% in January to March, which would outpace Britain which only expanded by 0.3%. Last week we learned that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only grew by 0.3%, while Spain managed a healthy 0.8%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report should give a wider picture of the currency bloc Recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data from the eurozone has been impressive, with factory growth at a six-year high. So this is the moment when we scrutinise the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data to see if the eurozone has really turned a corner. RBC Capital Markets explain: Euro area survey data has been universally strong since the turn of the year; the average composite PMI for Q1 was the highest in six years and is pointing to GDP growth of 0.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.6%. However, harder data has yet to reflect the improved sentiment; outside Germany, industrial production is likely to be a drag on growth despite stronger manufacturing PMIs. We also get another healthcheck on the UK building sector, at 9.30am. The City expects a small slowdown in growth, with the construction PMI tipped to fall to 52.0 from 52.2. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking for signs that builders are facing any impact from Brexit; perhaps through weaker demand, or a shortage of workers from overseas.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be monitoring any fallout from the latest Greek agreement. As we covered yesterday, Athens has accepted even more cuts in return for fresh loans - and the promise of debt relief..... European markets are expected to be subdued, after some solid gains in recent days. Later, US Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy at 7pm BST. But no change is expected, and there is isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a press conference scheduled. On the corporate front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from supermarket chain Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, pub chain JD Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, accountancy group Sage and insurance chain Direct Line.",

                "bodyText":"The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, has warned the rise in household debt has made Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy less resilient to future shocks. He said some households were carrying such high levels of debt relative to income that they may respond to a future economic shock by sharply cutting spending. In a speech to the Economic Society of Australia on Thursday, Lowe said he was concerned about the link between rising household debt and house prices, though not because he thought the banking system risked becoming unstable. He said Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soundly capitalised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and recent stress tests confirmed they were resilient to large movements in residential property prices. Rather, he said the RBA was concerned about the possibility of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153future sharp cuts in household spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from highly indebted households. Given the high levels of debt and housing prices, relative to incomes, it was likely some households could respond to a future shock to income or housing prices by deciding they had borrowed too much, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could prompt a sharp contraction in their spending, as they try to get their balance sheets back into better shape. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An otherwise manageable downturn could be turned into something more serious,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he warned. Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning comes just five days before the federal budget, in which the government is expected to announce plans to charge foreigners up to $5,000 for leaving their Australian apartments empty. The government is also reportedly planning to ban foreigners from buying more than half of the apartments in new apartment builds, in a bid to help more Australians buy their first property. Lowe said the RBA was mindful of the changes that have occurred in the economy in response to rising house prices and household debt. He said in earlier periods of rising housing prices, the household sector withdrew equity from their housing to finance spending, but today, households were much less inclined to do this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of us feel that we have enough debt and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to increase consumption using borrowed money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lowe said. He said his overall assessment was that the economy had become less resilient to future shocks as house prices and debt have risen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given this assessment, the Reserve Bank has strongly supported the prudential measures undertaken by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [Apra],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Double-digit growth in debt owed by investors at a time of weak income growth cannot be strengthening the resilience of our economy. Nor can a high concentration of interest-only loans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Lowe said he also believed the balance between supply and demand in Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Melbourne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property markets would become better balanced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said the increased rate of home building, and investment in transport, would put downward pressure on prices and rents. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] to the extent that, over time, a better balance is established, we will be better off not incurring too much debt, and having housing prices go too high, while this is occurring,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he warned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the current environment, the resilience of our economy would be enhanced by an extended period in which housing prices and debt outstanding increased no faster than our incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. 1) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy looks healthier than a few days ago. Growth in the dominant service sector has hit a four-month high this morning, following similar strong data from the manufacturing and construction sector this week. 2) The car industry, though, seems to have hit a bump. Sales slumped by 20% last month, after buyers scrambled to buy new cars in March before tax changes hit. 3) The eurozone recovery looks intact; service sector growth roared to a six-year high last month. Firms reported a rise in demand, encouraging them to take on more staff. 4) The euro has strengthened, as have French bonds, as Emmanuel Macron remained the favourite to win Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. Macron has just picked up an endorsement from Barack Obama, while Le Pen is being backed by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage... 5) In the City, shares in Next have fallen sharply after the retailer cut its profit forecasts and warned that conditions are tough. HSBC is having a better day, though, up 3% after beating profit forecasts. 6) Commodity prices are also under pressure, with oil hitting a five-month low today. David Morrison of SpreadCo explains why: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been no let-up in the rout in crude oil today. The benchmark WTI contract is down close to 2.5% this afternoon while Brent has slumped below $50. Both contracts trading at their lowest levels since late November last year, just after OPEC and other major producers agreed to their 1.8 million barrel per day output cut. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off accelerated after Russia said that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no decision to date on extending the production cut beyond June. That may be all for today, unless anything huge happens. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Over in New York, the stock market has opened cautiously as traders await another vote in Congress over healthcare. The Dow Jones industrial average is up just 20 points, or 0.1%. Republicans claim they have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act introduced under President Obama. But it could be close.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent UK service sector data, from Kathleen Brooks of City Index: The UK service sector has caught up with the manufacturing sector, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI data for April suggests that the UK economy will rebound once more in Q2, after a disappointing start to the year. This has been greeted by a bounce higher in the pound, although GBP/USD hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to sustain gains above 1.2900 so far. As we move into election season, the UK economy is playing into Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands, which could help to reduce political uncertainty as we lead up to the General Election next month. This is significant for UK assets, particularly the pound, which has been very sensitive to UK political risk post-Brexit. Thus, an easy win for Theresa May next month combined with a pick-up in UK economic data could help GBP/USD break through the 1.30 barrier in the coming weeks. As we lead up to the election on June 8th June, UK economic data will be just as important as the polls for traders to keep an eye on. The oil price is taking a kicking today, hitting its lowest level since last December. Brent crude is down 1.9% at $49.84, a five-month low, while US oil fell below $47 per barrel. This comes after figures yesterday showed US oil inventories are higher than expected, suggesting weaker demand. Reuters explains: U.S. data showed crude inventories fell 930,000 barrels in the week to April 28, against analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for a decrease of 2.3 million barrels. Stocks have steadily declined for the last four weeks, but at 527.8 million barrels they are just 7 million barrels off a record high. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concern that the OPEC cartel might not extend their deal to cut production. That agreement expires in June, although it could be extended at a meeting later this month..... Two pieces of US economic data just flashed up. 1) America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit was smaller than expected in March. The gap between US imports and exports came in at $43.7bn, close to February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $43.8bn, and lower than the $44.5bn expected. Imports fell by 0.7% during the month, while exports shrank by 0.9%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politically sensitive trade gap with China widened by 7%, though. That may be because trade patterns returned to normal after the Chinese New Year holidays. 2) The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit fell unexpectedly last week. Just 238,000 people applied for unemployment benefit last week, down from 257,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than expected, showing how the US labour market remains strong. Optimism over Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French election continues to bubble through Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets today. The euro has risen almost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.0922, and French bonds have also strengthened. Traders are concluding that Emmanuel Macron has cleared one of the last hurdles between him and the \u00c3\u2030lys\u00c3\u00a9e Palace, having survived last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate with Marine Le Pen relatively unscathed. Taxi driver are a popular weathervane on these occasions, and Politico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nicholas Vinocur has found one who has switched to Macron. Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election will still be a major event, though, as a surprise Le Pen victory would shake the markets and herald a new phase of euro crisis. Barclays will have extra sales and trading staff at work around the globe this weekend, while its research team will also provide 24-hour coverage for clients. A spokesperson says: Barclays will have extra Sales and Trading staff in our offices in New York, London and Singapore, in order to help our clients navigate through any ensuing market volatility as the French election second round results come in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the eurozone basks in the sun of nascent economic recovery, in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been blasting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro zone partners (and IMF) for their unfriendly behaviour towards the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest link. Helena Smith reports from Athens Just days after a landmark agreement with them, Alexis Tsipras has resorted to some of his language of yore to describe the international creditors keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat. Addessing his cabinet this morning the leftist leader slammed the economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the eurozone and IMF had elected to inflict on Greece. Tsipras declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lenders are not our friends. And nor did they become our friends in June 2015, or May 2016 or now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that is not just a moral judgement. It is the reality. On the one hand, lenders want to secure the money that they loaned Greece, on the other they want [to impose] a particular model and strategy of organising the economy. This model very often clashes with the one that we want for the country, for the economy, to cover social needs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek prime minister then went on to defend the way his government had negotiated the latest bailout review saying it was precisely because it was not prepared to agree to measures \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it had negotiated so hard. The agreement, which foresee Athens applying yet more punitive pension cuts and tax increases come 2019, has been criticised by leading figures in Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ruling Syriza party - although it also pays the way to much-need possible debt relief. The concessionary measures will be put before the 300-seat parliament later this month so that the deal can be finalized \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and emergency funds disbursed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the next meeting of euro group finance ministers on May 22. Greece faces major debt repayment worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn on July 7th. City traders are continuing to thump Next, following the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downbeat trading update this morning (details here). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car registration figures also show that sales of diesel-powered cars plunged by 27% year-on-year in April. That may show that recent pollution scandals (yes you, Volkswagen) and new taxes on high-emitting vehicles are spooking drivers. Shaun Armstrong, managing director of online car finance provider Creditplus.co.uk says: Buyers have been spooked by the planned introduction of a toxin tax on diesel cars and the London Mayor Sadiq Khan announcing an additional charge on polluting diesel vehicles entering central London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May then showed her disdain for diesel by hinting that the Government is considering introducing a scrappage scheme to incentivise drivers to trade in older diesel vehicles.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the sharp fall in car sales in April: This chart highlights how UK services firms hiked their prices in April, as the inflationary impact of the weaker pound ripples through the economy. And this one shows how bosses are a little less optimistic than in March (although still fairly upbeat): We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got fresh evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is slowing. Mortgage approvals fell to a six-month low of 66,837 in March, down from 67,936 in February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a weaker reading than expected, and the second monthly fall in a row. Recent surveys have shown that price growth has slowed recently, suggesting the market is cooling as real wage growth slows. The UK services sector had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stellar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd April, says Duncan Brock of Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. However, growth is being driven by orders from other companies - rather than the public, he adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A supportive economic backdrop helped to boost the UK service sector, with resilient demand reported both at home and from abroad. Going full steam ahead with staff hires rising at one of the fastest rates since last summer, this relieved capacity pressures and provides a signal that service providers anticipate additional growth in the coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The driver of growth came primarily from business clients, as consumers took a back seat, uneasy about rising costs for essentials such as food, fuel and energy which rose at the fastest rate since July 2008. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, is encouraged that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI hit a four-month high in April. But....he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned that prices rose so sharply; this could hit economic growth this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although the services PMI beat expectations, some of the details give pause for thought. Input costs continue to point to higher inflation in the months ahead, a factor that is likely to weigh on consumers. Furthermore, although firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 optimism about the year ahead is still positive, it fell for the third consecutive month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the figures continue to point to the economy expanding in the current quarter, something that will provide the PM with some comfort going into the General Election and the Brexit negotiations soon after. However, an interesting nuance in the data at the moment is that surveys signal a greater sense of growth than the hard data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though markets are unlikely to be bothered this. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news too..... service sector companies are hiking prices at the fastest race since July 2008. Firms argue that they had to raise prices, because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been hit by higher costs themselves. Markit reports: UK service providers indicated a strong rise in input costs during April, despite the rate of inflation easing to a seven-month low. This was mostly linked to higher utility bills, full costs, salary payments and food prices. As a result, average prices charged by services firms increased at a robust pace that was the fastest recorded since July 2008. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now had a hat-trick of good UK economic data this week, as economist Rupert Seggins tweets: (however, these PMI reports are only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like an actual GDP report) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to have picked up speed, after growth slowed to just 0.3% in January-March. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn in the services PMI rounds off a hat- trick of good news after upside surprises to both the manufacturing and construction PMIs. The three surveys collectively point to GDP growing at a rate of 0.6% at the start of the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good reason to believe that at least 0.4% GDP growth can be achieved in the second quarter as a whole. Breaking! Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has hit a four-month high. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Service Sector PMI has jumped to 55.8 in April, up from 55.0 in March, and the highest reading this year. That signals stronger growth last month in the dominant sector of the UK economy. Markit says that service sector firms enjoyed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sustained rebound in business activity during April, supported by the fastest upturn in new work so far in 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Job creation also hit a four-month high, as companies struggled to handle the increased demand. Service sector bosses are also confident about growth prospects over the next 12 months, Markit adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key facts: More to follow! Eek! UK new car registrations tumbled by almost 20% in April as new tax changes hit the sector. That includes a 28% slide in private car sales, suggesting that consumer are reining themselves in. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a complicated picture, though, as new tax changes came into force last month. The new Vehicle Excise Duty rules made it much more expensive to run certain cars, sparking a jump in sales in March. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says: With the rush to register new cars and avoid VED tax rises before the end of March, as well as fewer selling days due to the later Easter, April was always going to be much slower. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that the market remains at record levels as customers still see many benefits in purchasing a new car. We therefore expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Sam Tombs: April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong PMIs suggest that the eurozone recovery picked up speed last month, says Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the final reading coming in slightly above the earlier flash estimate, the PMI surveys portray an economy that is growing at an encouragingly robust pace and that risks are moving from the downside to a more balanced situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The April Eurozone PMI is historically consistent with a GDP growth rate of 0.7%, with similar rates of expansion signalled for both Germany and France. Even faster gains are being indicated in Spain and Ireland and Italy is also seeing growth perk up, highlighting the increasingly broad-based nature of the current upturn. The eurozone grew by 0.5% in the first three months of this year. If growth really does accelerate to 0.7%, talk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEuro boom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 might not seem too daft. Boom! The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has just reported its strongest growth since the debt crisis began in 2011. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite output index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks thousands of companies across the region, has jumped to 56.8 in April, up from 56.4 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong services PMIs, plus Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equally strong manufacturing data. A surge in new business helped companies to boost their output by the fastest rate in 72 months, says Markit. Underpinning growth of economic activity was a strong increase in incoming new business. New orders rose for the twenty-ninth month running, with the rate of expansion staying close to March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high. The outlook for the economy also remained relatively bright in April, with business optimism about levels of output in one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time staying close to March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series-record high. Rising backlogs of work also suggested that new order growth was sufficiently robust to test capacity and provide a buffer of incomplete work. Encouragingly, firms also reported a rise in employment levels in April. Markit explains: Although the rate of job creation slowed, it was still one of the best seen over the past decade. Accelerated workforce growth in Spain and Ireland partly offset slower increases in Germany and Italy. Ditto Germany. Its services PMI has hit a two-month low of 55.4, down from 55.6 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the earlier \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimate and still shows solid growth. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI has missed forecasts, but remains comfortably in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrowth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 territory (ie, over 50). Wow! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew at its fastest pace in almost a decade. The Italian services PMI has jumped to 56.2, showing pretty strong growth, up from 52.9 in March. Markit says: The strong growth was driven by rising demand, which also led to the creation of more jobs as capacity pressures intensified. Another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is having a pretty decent year.... Optimism that Emmanuel Macron will beat Marine Le Pen to the French presidency is pushing shares higher, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She writes: French Presidential favourite Macron was considered to have outperformed Marine Le Pen in the final Presidential debate in France last night. This has helped to boost equity markets in Europe and we have also seen a drop in French bond yields, suggesting that political risk premia is falling sharply ahead of the second round of the French election on Sunday. Interestingly, an opinion poll has also suggested that Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En Marche! party could claim a large share of seats in the French Assembly in June.... Ol\u00c3\u00a9! Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector has posted strong growth last month. The Spanish services PMI has jumped to 57.8, signalling the fastest growth rate since August 2015, according to data firm Markit. Spanish companies reported a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sharp increases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in activity and new business, meaning they took on more staff to tackle higher workloads. Markit says: April survey data pointed to further sharp monthly rises in activity and new business in the Spanish service sector. Higher workloads encouraged firms to expand their operating capacity, and to this end employment increased to the greatest extent in nine months. Companies generally expect these trends to be sustained, supporting further optimism around the 12-month outlook. Over in Paris, the CAC 40 index has hit its highest level since 2008. French bonds are also rallying, after Emmanuel Macron was judged to have outperformed Marine Le Pen in a notably ill-tempered and hostile TV debate last night: High street chain Next has cut its growth and profit forecasts, in the latest sign that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector is struggling. In a downbeat trading update, Next warned that: The UK consumer environment remains challenging, particularly in the clothing and homeware markets, and real wage growth is now close to zero. Sales of full-price items at Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shops has fallen by over 8% in the last three months; a sign that shoppers are cutting back in the face of higher inflation. It now expects to make profits of between \u00c2\u00a3680m and \u00c2\u00a3740m this year, down from a previous range of \u00c2\u00a3680m to \u00c2\u00a3780m. This has sent Next shares slumping by 5%, the worst performer on the FTSE 100. Banking giant HSBC has also beaten City expectations. Pre-tax profits in the first quarter came in at $5bn, comfortably ahead of the $4.3bn expected. CEO Stuart Gulliver appears to be making progress in stemming the fall in revenue at HSBC; adjusted revenues rose by 2% (once you strip out currency effects and the impat of selling HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brazil operations). An upbeat Gulliver says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a good set of results. The increase in adjusted profit was driven by strong performances in three of our four global businesses. Global Banking and Markets had a great quarter; Commercial Banking delivered higher revenue from our liquidity and cash management activities; and Retail Banking and Wealth Management was supported by rising interest rates and renewed customer investment appetite. HSBC shares are up almost 3% in early trading. Oil firm Royal Dutch Shell is leading the rally in London, up 3%, after beating analyst forecasts. Shell doubled its earnings to $3.8bn, up from $1.6bn, in what CEO Ben van Beurden called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. European stock markets have risen at the start of trading, helped by the fall in the pound and the euro against the US dollar overnight. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 0.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 0.2% to a fresh all-time high Ireland has got Service Sector PMI day off to a good start. Growth in Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector hit a 10-month high in April, according to Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report. Companies reported a rise in new business, as clients grew more optimistic about economic prospects. This encouraged them to take on more staff to deal with a jump in new orders. This sent the Irish Service PMI rocketing up to 61.1 in April, up from 59.1 in March - the highest reading since last June. Philip O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, says the report \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paints a bright picture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with service sector bosses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the next 12 months. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a more optimistic mood in the City this morning, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank gave an upbeat assessment of the US economy last night. After leaving interest rates on hold, the Federal Reserve predicted that the recent slowdown in US growth was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely to be transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, pointing to encouraging employment statistics and rising business investment. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the statement was... ...carefully crafted to acknowledge what the FOMC suggested were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransitory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weaknesses in personal consumption and core inflation, while placing particular emphasis on the pick-up in business investment and the strength of the labour market. Fed watchers reckon we should expect a US interest rate rise in June.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed up the dollar against the pound and the euro, which means European stock markets are tipped to rise this morning: Investors are now looking to a flurry of service sector reports this morning, from data firm Markit. They may confirm that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening, with Germany, Italy, France and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI all expected to rise. Those figures come between 8.15am and 9am BST. RBC Capital Markets say: For both Spain and Italy, we expect the services reading to improve on March. That, coupled with Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher manufacturing PMI would leave the composite PMI higher in both, consistent with the picture for the wider euro area that the improved Q1 sentiment has been sustained into Q2. The UK service sector PMI (at 9.30am) is tipped to drop to 54.6, from 55 in March -- that would mean a small slowdown in growth. However, the manufacturing and construction PMIs have already beaten expectations, so perhaps services might surprise us as well. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting new UK car registration figures at 9am BST, and eurozone retail sales figures at 10am. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also masses of UK corporate news to watch, with HSBC, Societe Generale, Next, Morrisons, Royal Dutch Shell, Rolls-Royce and Randgold all reporting results.",

That was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and confounded forecasts for a dip to 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>Job creation also picked up, according to the survey, which excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector.

                "bodyText":"The UK economy has shown signs of picking up over recent weeks as strong demand from overseas helped offset moribund consumer spending at home, according to a survey that will welcomed by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government as next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election approaches. News that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector enjoyed its fastest growth for four months in April follows surveys earlier this week signalling similar improvements for the smaller manufacturing and construction industries. Together they will soothe fears around the UK economic outlook after official figures showed GDP growth slowed markedly in the first quarter. But behind the positive headlines there were continued signs that consumers are reining in spending as the Brexit-hit pound stokes inflation. Hotels and restaurants were among the consumer-facing businesses feeling those effects in April, the services report showed. The main business activity reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report (pdf) rose to 55.8 in April from 55.0 in March. That was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and confounded forecasts for a dip to 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. Job creation also picked up, according to the survey, which excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector. It found services were confident about their prospects for growth over the year, although the degree of optimism moderated for the third month running. The survey compilers also noted that in the face of rising costs, companies were putting up their prices at the fastest pace since July 2008, adding to pressures on consumers. Costs have risen due to higher crude oil prices and because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop since the Brexit vote makes imports more expensive. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the PMI report compilers, IHS Markit, said the polls for services, construction and manufacturing together pointed to GDP growth accelerating at the start of the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good reason to believe that at least 0.4% GDP growth can be achieved in the second quarter as a whole,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. In the first quarter, GDP growth slowed to 0.3% from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The services report said April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in activity was partly down to resilient business-to-business demand, which includes activity such as a firm hiring legal or consultancy services. There was also support from new product launches and, in some cases, another rise in sales to overseas clients. The authors said new business expanded at a faster pace in April and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anecdotal evidence from survey respondents suggested that greater business-to-business sales had helped to offset subdued discretionary consumer spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the survey \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably overstates the buoyancy of growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, noting that it excludes the retail sector, which has been hurt by weaker consumer spending in recent months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pretty much everyone is expecting growth to slow this year because of a weakening consumer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Still, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be minded to think that GDP rebounds a little bit into the second quarter, probably up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter to 0.4-0.5% quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The reports will provide more mixed signals for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee to debate when it meets to set interest rates and publish its latest forecasts for the UK economy next week. The Bank, under governor Mark Carney, has repeatedly said it faces a trade-off between keeping inflation under control and supporting growth and jobs.

After tough negotiations, he said, international lenders had finally agreed to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands that counter measures be instituted if fiscal targets and budget savings are better than expected.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fd6d44537c8092fb8564313ac6af3c7c6f85117\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fd6d44537c8092fb8564313ac6af3c7c6f85117/0_104_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras addresses the leftist Syriza party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawmakers in parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras addresses the leftist Syriza party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawmakers in parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simela Pantzartzi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the time comes, the government will hand out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what will be left after having exceeded its [primary] surplus [targets],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.</p> <p>The preliminary agreement, to be complemented by further talks in the coming weeks, is expected to be harshly debated before the vote takes place.

Here are some initial reactions to the figures:</p> <h2>James Knightly, senior economist at ING Bank:</h2> <p><em>Healthy jobs growth has returned and unemployment has fallen again, offering support to the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of gradually raising rates.</em></p> <p><em>The April US jobs report has non-farm payrolls rising 211,000 versus the 190,000 consensus. There were 6,000 downward revisions to the past couple of months, but this is still much better than 79,000 outcome last month. There was also good news in the form of the unemployment rate surprisingly dropping to 4.4% from 4.5% (It was 4.8% just three months ago). Underemployment also fell sharply (8.6% versus 8.9% previously) to its lowest since late 2007, suggesting more and more people are switching from part to full time work.</em></p> <p><em>The one disappointment was the fact annual wage growth slipped to 2.5% from 2.6% despite the month on month increase matching the 0.3% consensus forecast. The fact that we are still quite a way away from 3%+ wage growth means that there is no real pressure on the Fed to accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes.</em></p> <p><em>Nonetheless, the rebound in employment offers support to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion from earlier in the week that the slowdown in activity seen in the first quarter is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This would suggest the FOMC members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts that they will hike rates by 25bp on two, possibly three more occasions this year, still holds. The markets remain a little more cautious, pricing in around 40bp of tightening while our official forecast is for just one 25bp hike.</em></p> <p><em>However, this data is not helpful for our call and we will need to see activity numbers continue to disappoint and inflation to come in softer (which is possible given commodity prices). It is also likely that we will need to see President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending polices failing to make headway for the Fed to re-evaluate the prospective path of interest rates.</em></p> <h2><strong>Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab:</strong></h2> <p><em>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers from the jobs report represent a strong bounce-back following the disappointing figures recorded the month prior and are testament to a growing economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also the March report reflected payback for weather-related strength in January and February. With the Fed hitting the pause button in May, the recovery in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment data gives weight to the prospect of a further rate hike in June and the possibility of two or three more this year. We continue to believe the bull market in US equities will continue due to decent economic growth and a good profits picture driven by strong underlying fundamentals.</em></p> <h2>Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com:</h2> <p><em>Following March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly low non-farm payroll reading, both President Trump and Janet Yellen will be pleased to see it bounce back significantly in April. </em><em>There have been a few bumps in the road for the Fed to navigate in recent weeks, but these are expected to smooth out in time.</em></p> <p><em>Low levels of productivity growth is perhaps the biggest concern, although economic confidence remains high within the business community. </em><em>It clearly hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been plain sailing for the Fed, but the US economy still appears to be on the right path and a further two interest rate hikes this year remains the most likely scenario.</em></p> <h2><strong>Naeem Aslam, c</strong><strong>hief market analyst at </strong><strong>Think Markets UK:</strong></h2> <p><em>The number released today is more than twice the March increase and this has provided much aid for the monthly average. The biggest surprise for investors in this report is your big drop in jobless rate to 4.4 % but there is one cloud here, the participation rate has fallen. Trump administration has made a big fuss about the participation rate and given that this rate has dropped even further, investors have the right to know what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admisnitration will do to address this problem. </em></p> <p><em>Nonetheless, the data has shown that the there is a momentum in the economy and the recovery in the US economy still has strong legs to stand on. It appears that the Fed is on the correct side of the trade. Investors are more likely to believe the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance that the weakness in the economic data is only transitory. In short, it is safe to say that we are not going to run into a recession that easily because we need a mammoth shock for that to happen. The jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market is healthy and in order for this to become even more healthier, we need to see the real wage number to continue to improve. We know that inflation has improved, but the wages have not ripped higher that much and this leaves the US economy open to some shocks. </em></p> <p><em>The fact is that as long as the US NFP number stays between 150-250K, the Fed is not going to change their current narrative much. Any number in this range pretty much supports Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance who thinks that the labour market will improve further. The story of bad weather is behind us and investors are considering this as a positive thing because they can no longer cloud Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgment.</em></p> <h2>Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital:</h2> <p><em>Not too hot and not too cold. As we needed it, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonfarm payrolls are just right to nail on a June rate hike but not enough to make us think the Fed will turn more hawkish. After a big miss in March, the April number was a big beat at 211k.<br></em></p> <p><em>Markets are pretty well taking this in their stride as the numbers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything to alter picture in favour of a hike in June and one more after that. The dollar is pretty well at the mid-point for the day against the yen. We saw a big swing in the euro-dollar rate but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also trading much on a level for the day. Cable is a shade higher with the pound trying gamely to hold on to the $1.295 handle but struggling.</em></p> <p><em>Judging by these numbers the US labour market remains in rude health and should offer the Fed all the ammunition it needs to raise rates again in June. After some doubts were cast over the pace tightening by the first quarter GDP miss, the Fed looks justified in thinking this would be transitory.</em></p> <p><em>The unemployment rate dipped a little to 4.4%, but with the labour force participation so poor that number means little overall. Earnings continued their steady but unspectacular rise, with a year-on-year gain of 2.5% marginally slower than the previous month,</em></p> <p><em>Revisions were mixed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c March was revised even lower, proving just what a big outlier that number was, while February was revised higher.

But there is plenty of divergence in analyst expectations.</p> <h2><strong>Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management:</strong></h2> <p><em>Job creation could be on the order of 200,000-plus in April after the prior month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak 98,000 outturn. Employment growth has been edging slightly lower over time, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the deceleration was truly as sharp as claimed in the March figures. Most employment figures remain cheery and our model still points to above-consensus strength.</em></p> <h2>Unicredit economics team:</h2> <p><em>Non-farm payrolls likely rose a more solid 175,000 in April, following a disappointing 98,000 in March. The April report should represent the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd report this year, with the numbers for the past several months having been affected by unusual weather patterns.</em></p> <p><em>Looking through the monthly volatility, average employment gains have averaged 163,000 over the past six months, and 178,000 over the past three months. Weekly jobless claims indicators suggest that underlying momentum has not changed in several months. The jobless rate likely edged up again by 0.1 percentage points to 4.6%, a small technical correction after the rate dropped by 0.3 percentage points over the past two months. </em><br></p> <h2>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK:</h2> <p><em>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls are expected to come in at 190,000 for April but there will also be particular scrutiny on any revision to the surprisingly low March number of 98,000, especially in light of the fact that the equivalent ADP number was so strong at 263,000. Weather related arguments don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really stack up when there is that sort of divergence.</em></p> <p><em>The unemployment rate is expected to tick up slightly to 4.6%, but the more important factor will be what wages do. Yesterday labour costs for the first quarter shot up to 3% from 1.3%, so you would expect to see equivalent inflationary pressures in average hourly earnings, however expectations here are for an unchanged number of 2.7%. Ultimately investors will be looking for evidence of a tightening labour market but thus far there has been little evidence of that despite jobless claims being at multi year lows.</em></p> <h2><strong>Ipek Ozkardeskaya, s</strong>enior market analyst at London Capital Group:</h2> <p><em>The expectation is 190,000, a touch superior to the 12-month average of 188,000. A solid read could revive the short-term US dollar bulls, while a second month of disappointment should dent the US dollar appetite before the weekly closing bell and help the euro and the pound fighting the 1.10 and 1.30 resistances respectively.</em></p> <p><em>We warn that the hawkish Federal Reserve expectations may have shattered the upside potential in the greenback and the enthusiasm on an eventually strong read could be short-lived. The pricing in the market already factors in 93.9% chances of a June Fed rate hike.</em></p> <p> <strong> <br></strong></p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-05T11:08:11.756Z\">at 12.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-590c4d8be4b0d608cb081a52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-05T10:02:11.972Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a succinct summary of the oil situation from the Economist Intelligence Unit:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinBew/status/860433982940491776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oil mkts gloomy about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a> continuing its production restraint.

Scepticism about the effectiveness of the supply deal had grown in recent weeks with global oil inventories receding much slower than anticipated.</p> <p>The revived US shale boom undermines the Middle East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restriction efforts, among other sources of near-term supply growth. US oil production surpassed expectations in terms of an early bottoming and swift up tick, and is set to expand further based on the latest drilling momentum.</p> <p>Prices are back to fundamentally justified levels and should somewhat tame the latest shale boom frenzy, which is necessary for longer-term stability in the oil market. An extension of the supply deal beyond June looks likely but its effectiveness will remain questioned.</p> <p>The past months reveal the new oil market realities where the responsiveness and competitiveness of the US shale industry prevents prices from rising sustainably beyond $50 per barrel. On the other hand, we are unlikely to rewrite the story-book of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil collapse. We raise our view to neutral from bearish and roll our three-month price target to $47.5 from $50 per barrel. Moreover, with our target prices reached we close our short position in Brent futures initiated late January.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-590c2e09e4b097b3ab99c548\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-05T08:02:46.852Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">M&amp;S appoints Archie Norman as chairman</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"844cb8ca8be87e590c3feed7f7359e279141eae9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/844cb8ca8be87e590c3feed7f7359e279141eae9/0_206_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks &amp; Spencer logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer has appointed retail veteran Archie Norman as its new chairman. </strong></p> <p>Norman, whose previous roles include Asda chief executive and ITV chairman, will take up the role from 1 September, replacing current chairman Robert Swannell who will retire from the board.</p> <p>Norman, 63, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am looking forward to taking on the role of the chairmanship of Marks &amp; Spencer as the business under Steve Rowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership faces into the considerable challenges ahead in a rapidly changing retail landscape.</p> </blockquote> <p>Investors have welcomed the news, with M&amp;S shares currently up 3.6%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/m-and-s-archie-norman-chairman-marks-spencer\">M&amp;S appoints Archie Norman as new chairman</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-590c2ad9e4b097b3ab99c53d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-05T07:43:20.566Z\">8.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets have followed Asia lower in early trading, as the lower oil price weighs on shares.</strong></p> <p>The scores so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,243</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 12,606</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.5% at 5,347</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 21,134</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,984</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 391</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-590c2521e4b097b3ab99c52a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-05T07:29:47.914Z\">8.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit will 'stall' City of London, Goldman Sachs warns</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0eb82b096842f1a8d71c68e1b9a74f90a7c7df3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb82b096842f1a8d71c68e1b9a74f90a7c7df3c/0_136_4068_2441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Blankfein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyd Blankfein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Another Brexit warning, this time from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest investment bank. </strong></p> <p><strong>Lloyd Blankfein </strong>said London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to the turmoil of the Brexit process.</p> <p>He told the BBC:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> [The City] will stall, it might backtrack a bit, it just depends on a lot of things about which we are uncertain and I know there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t certainty at the moment.

                "bodyText":"US drillers added oil rigs last week for the sixteenth week in a row. The Baker Hughes rig count showed 6 oil rigs added to give a total of 703, the largest number since April 2015. Two gas rigs were added to give 173. The figures give an indication of the growing production from the US, although the pace of additions has slowed in recent weeks as the crude price held below $50 a barrel. Following the release of the Baker Hughes figures, oil prices edged higher with Brent crude up 1.5% at $49.15, up from a 1% increase. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Ahead of the French election, investors seemed to be betting the more-market friendly Emmanuel Macron was likely to win the day, and pushed European markets higher. The moves came despite the better than expected US jobs figures doing little for the American market. On the French elections, Oliver Jones at Capital Economics said: Investors breathed a sigh of relief after Emmanuel Macron claimed the largest share of the vote in the first round of the French presidential election, and there is scope for a further rally if, as opinion polls suggest, he wins Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run-off handsomely. [But]we are not convinced that French bonds and the euro would stay strong for very long. For one thing, political risk will linger ahead of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Assembly elections, especially if Macron doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win the run-off by the wide margin that the polls suggest. A relatively narrow victory would increase the chances that Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party, En Marche!, fails to secure a majority in those elections, which in turn would damage the prospects for his market-friendly labour reforms. But ahead of all that, the final scores on stock markets showed: The FTSE 100 climbed 49.33 points or 0.68% at 7297.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.55% to a record high of 12,716.89 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 1.12% at a nine and a half year high of 5432.40 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 1.48% at 21,483.86 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.11% better at 11,135.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.68% to 753.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 10 points or 0.05%. After the recent falls on worries about oversupply and the (lack of) effect of the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attempts to cap suppliers, oil prices are heading higher again. Brent crude is now up 1.9% at $49.32 a barrel having fallen as low as $46.64. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Oil prices have bounced this afternoon, recovering a significant portion of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy losses, but other than a snap-back rally in an overstretched market there is little sign of a firm fundamental reason. One piece of news was that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude oil production was down 6.5% in the first quarter, but investors will be keen to see the latest Baker Hughes rig count this evening for an update on US production. Over to Greece now. With another vote looming over painful pension cuts and tax increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the price of emergency bailout loans to avoid default \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Greek prime minister has been busily trying to sweeten the pills today telling his own leftist MPS that the end of austerity is in sight.Helena Smith reports from Athens: It has been four days since Greece cut a preliminary agreement with creditors that paves the way to disbursement of loans in return for more painful reforms and which should open the door to debt relief. In theory all 153 MPs in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 two-party coalition will also support the measures when put to parliament for vote on May 16. But disaffection is mounting in the ranks of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own Syriza party with many leftists openly questioning the wisdom of applying measures that will not only deepen Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt deflationary cycle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in so doing aggravate a depression now longer and deeper than that suffered in the US in the 1930s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but further impoverish those already hit hardest by the crisis. With his own legacy now at stake, Tsipras has launched a concerted effort to bring lawmakers on board, telling a gathering of his parliamentary group today that any surplus money will be used to ease the pain of the most vulnerable. After tough negotiations, he said, international lenders had finally agreed to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands that counter measures be instituted if fiscal targets and budget savings are better than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the time comes, the government will hand out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what will be left after having exceeded its [primary] surplus [targets],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The preliminary agreement, to be complemented by further talks in the coming weeks, is expected to be harshly debated before the vote takes place. Measures include a 13th pension cut of as much as 18% and abolishment of tax breaks that will broaden the tax base. With the entire opposition refusing to endorse the measures, it is imperative that ruling MPs, who have a narrow majority in the 300-seat House, back them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are standing before a deal which gives us the prospect of an exit [from the debt crisis],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told MPs, describing it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comprehensive agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is in our hand to vindicate the trust that the Greek people showed in us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Tsipras also insisted that creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honoured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their side of the deal and outlined medium-term debt relief measures by the time eurozone finance ministers next meet on May 22. His wish is unlikely to be met. The German finance ministry also insisted today that debt relief would only come once the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153current adjustment programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd expires in September 2018. US markets are struggling for direction despite the better than expected April jobs figures. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened more than 0.25 higher but the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 27 points or 013% lower, dragged down by a fall in IBM following reports billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett had sold about a third of his stake. Back with the corporate world, and Pearson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading update may have pleased the market, but the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders have just staged a revolt against the pay package awarded to chief executive John Fallon despite a number of profit warnings. The story is here: The better than expected non-farm payroll numbers mean another interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve is very much on the cards, analysts believe. Here are some initial reactions to the figures: James Knightly, senior economist at ING Bank: Healthy jobs growth has returned and unemployment has fallen again, offering support to the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of gradually raising rates. The April US jobs report has non-farm payrolls rising 211,000 versus the 190,000 consensus. There were 6,000 downward revisions to the past couple of months, but this is still much better than 79,000 outcome last month. There was also good news in the form of the unemployment rate surprisingly dropping to 4.4% from 4.5% (It was 4.8% just three months ago). Underemployment also fell sharply (8.6% versus 8.9% previously) to its lowest since late 2007, suggesting more and more people are switching from part to full time work. The one disappointment was the fact annual wage growth slipped to 2.5% from 2.6% despite the month on month increase matching the 0.3% consensus forecast. The fact that we are still quite a way away from 3%+ wage growth means that there is no real pressure on the Fed to accelerate the pace of interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, the rebound in employment offers support to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion from earlier in the week that the slowdown in activity seen in the first quarter is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This would suggest the FOMC members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts that they will hike rates by 25bp on two, possibly three more occasions this year, still holds. The markets remain a little more cautious, pricing in around 40bp of tightening while our official forecast is for just one 25bp hike. However, this data is not helpful for our call and we will need to see activity numbers continue to disappoint and inflation to come in softer (which is possible given commodity prices). It is also likely that we will need to see President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending polices failing to make headway for the Fed to re-evaluate the prospective path of interest rates. Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers from the jobs report represent a strong bounce-back following the disappointing figures recorded the month prior and are testament to a growing economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also the March report reflected payback for weather-related strength in January and February. With the Fed hitting the pause button in May, the recovery in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment data gives weight to the prospect of a further rate hike in June and the possibility of two or three more this year. We continue to believe the bull market in US equities will continue due to decent economic growth and a good profits picture driven by strong underlying fundamentals. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com: Following March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly low non-farm payroll reading, both President Trump and Janet Yellen will be pleased to see it bounce back significantly in April. There have been a few bumps in the road for the Fed to navigate in recent weeks, but these are expected to smooth out in time. Low levels of productivity growth is perhaps the biggest concern, although economic confidence remains high within the business community. It clearly hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been plain sailing for the Fed, but the US economy still appears to be on the right path and a further two interest rate hikes this year remains the most likely scenario. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK: The number released today is more than twice the March increase and this has provided much aid for the monthly average. The biggest surprise for investors in this report is your big drop in jobless rate to 4.4 % but there is one cloud here, the participation rate has fallen. Trump administration has made a big fuss about the participation rate and given that this rate has dropped even further, investors have the right to know what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admisnitration will do to address this problem. Nonetheless, the data has shown that the there is a momentum in the economy and the recovery in the US economy still has strong legs to stand on. It appears that the Fed is on the correct side of the trade. Investors are more likely to believe the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance that the weakness in the economic data is only transitory. In short, it is safe to say that we are not going to run into a recession that easily because we need a mammoth shock for that to happen. The jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market is healthy and in order for this to become even more healthier, we need to see the real wage number to continue to improve. We know that inflation has improved, but the wages have not ripped higher that much and this leaves the US economy open to some shocks. The fact is that as long as the US NFP number stays between 150-250K, the Fed is not going to change their current narrative much. Any number in this range pretty much supports Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance who thinks that the labour market will improve further. The story of bad weather is behind us and investors are considering this as a positive thing because they can no longer cloud Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgment. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: Not too hot and not too cold. As we needed it, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonfarm payrolls are just right to nail on a June rate hike but not enough to make us think the Fed will turn more hawkish. After a big miss in March, the April number was a big beat at 211k. Markets are pretty well taking this in their stride as the numbers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything to alter picture in favour of a hike in June and one more after that. The dollar is pretty well at the mid-point for the day against the yen. We saw a big swing in the euro-dollar rate but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also trading much on a level for the day. Cable is a shade higher with the pound trying gamely to hold on to the $1.295 handle but struggling. Judging by these numbers the US labour market remains in rude health and should offer the Fed all the ammunition it needs to raise rates again in June. After some doubts were cast over the pace tightening by the first quarter GDP miss, the Fed looks justified in thinking this would be transitory. The unemployment rate dipped a little to 4.4%, but with the labour force participation so poor that number means little overall. Earnings continued their steady but unspectacular rise, with a year-on-year gain of 2.5% marginally slower than the previous month, Revisions were mixed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c March was revised even lower, proving just what a big outlier that number was, while February was revised higher. Employment gains in February and March combined were 6,000 lower than we thought but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly enough to really matter. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a touch of volatility in the dollar but not a lot to worry about. The numbers were more than enough to confirm the base case that the Fed will continue with 2 additional hikes this year but taken alone does nothing to suggest policymakers should turn more hawkish than they have been. The dollar has lost its initial gains following the employment report, with the yearly drop in wage growth seemingly hitting sentiment. The dollar has edged higher after the better than expected April job numbers, but there is little change in the futures market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open slightly lower. The US jobless rate for April was slightly better than forecast at 4.4% rather than 4.6%, and better than March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 4.5%. Average hourly earnings month on month were in line with expectations with a rise of 0.3%. But the year on year increase fell from 2.6% to 2.5%. BREAKING: The US non-farm payroll numbers for April have come in better than expected, with a 211,000 rise compared to expectations of a 190,000 increase. But ast month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, the surprisingly low 98,000, was revised down to an even lower 79.000. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number though, was revised up from 219,000 to 232,000. So the chances of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure staying at 211,000 must be slim. The falling oil price could bring some good news for car owners. Patrick Collinson reports: Motorists could see around 3p chopped off the price of petrol this weekend if supermarkets match the sharp falls in the underlying oil price, according to the RAC. The national average price for unleaded should fall from 118p to 115p, the motoring group said, although it warned that many forecourts have been slow to pass on the savings and are instead increasing their profit margins. Earlier this week most supermarkets cut their petrol prices by 1-2p a litre, falling to around 114p, but the RAC said they should now fall further. The oil price has plummeted to a five-month low amid soaring US fracking production, weak demand in China and a failure by Opec to organise supply cuts to reduce the persistent global glut of crude. The full story is here: Looking ahead to the US non-farm payroll numbers for April, and there is expected to be a strong recovery after the surprisingly weak figure for March. But there is plenty of divergence in analyst expectations. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management: Job creation could be on the order of 200,000-plus in April after the prior month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak 98,000 outturn. Employment growth has been edging slightly lower over time, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the deceleration was truly as sharp as claimed in the March figures. Most employment figures remain cheery and our model still points to above-consensus strength. Unicredit economics team: Non-farm payrolls likely rose a more solid 175,000 in April, following a disappointing 98,000 in March. The April report should represent the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd report this year, with the numbers for the past several months having been affected by unusual weather patterns. Looking through the monthly volatility, average employment gains have averaged 163,000 over the past six months, and 178,000 over the past three months. Weekly jobless claims indicators suggest that underlying momentum has not changed in several months. The jobless rate likely edged up again by 0.1 percentage points to 4.6%, a small technical correction after the rate dropped by 0.3 percentage points over the past two months. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls are expected to come in at 190,000 for April but there will also be particular scrutiny on any revision to the surprisingly low March number of 98,000, especially in light of the fact that the equivalent ADP number was so strong at 263,000. Weather related arguments don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really stack up when there is that sort of divergence. The unemployment rate is expected to tick up slightly to 4.6%, but the more important factor will be what wages do. Yesterday labour costs for the first quarter shot up to 3% from 1.3%, so you would expect to see equivalent inflationary pressures in average hourly earnings, however expectations here are for an unchanged number of 2.7%. Ultimately investors will be looking for evidence of a tightening labour market but thus far there has been little evidence of that despite jobless claims being at multi year lows. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group: The expectation is 190,000, a touch superior to the 12-month average of 188,000. A solid read could revive the short-term US dollar bulls, while a second month of disappointment should dent the US dollar appetite before the weekly closing bell and help the euro and the pound fighting the 1.10 and 1.30 resistances respectively. We warn that the hawkish Federal Reserve expectations may have shattered the upside potential in the greenback and the enthusiasm on an eventually strong read could be short-lived. The pricing in the market already factors in 93.9% chances of a June Fed rate hike. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a succinct summary of the oil situation from the Economist Intelligence Unit: As well as the US non-farm payroll figures later, there are also the latest figures from Baker Hughes on the number of oil rigs working in the US last week. This of course has an influence on the crude price, showing as it does the growing US production which is offsetting the attempts by Opec and other producers to cap supplies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Wall Street Journal graphic showing the Baker Hughes rig count and the oil price: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said the decline in oil prices may have eased but there could be further losses ahead: The FTSE has managed to recover early losses, as news-driven gains for the likes of Pearson, M&amp;S and IAG dragged the index back into the green despite the negative sentiment from a week of plummeting crude prices. It seems the markets have given up all optimism when it comes to OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to dictate oil prices. For whatever OPEC does from here, it will either be undermined by low conformity (if the cut is too large) or a like-for-like rise in US production (in response to higher prices). In a world where Donald Trump is encouraging even greater US production, there is reason to believe the losses seen this week could be just the beginning. Here are the biggest movers in the FTSE 100: And here are the sector movements: After the drop in oil prices, there are now signs crude may be stabilising. Brent has now edged up 0.5% to $48.65 a barrel after falling as low as $46.64. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 0.26%. So the FTSE 100 - filled to the brim with oil sensitive commodity companies - has recovered from its early fall, and is now up 12 points or 0.17%. And British Airways owner International Airlines Group has soared more than 4% after a record first quarter performance. Operating profits rose a better than expected 9.7% despite a 2.8% fall in revenues. Chief executive Willie Walsh said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a record performance in the first quarter, traditionally our weakest quarter, with the improving trend in passenger unit revenue continuing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere educational specialist Pearson has jumped 10% making it the biggest riser in the leading index. After several profit warnings, there was relief its latest trading statement was in line with forecasts, with underlying sales up 6%. However analysts at Shore Capital were not convinced, saying: Although we see long-term growth in global learning spend as a potentially attractive opportunity for Pearson, we remain cautious on near term trading prospects and on the challenges involved in negotiating the substantial organisational and cultural change required to realign itself to a digital future. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update provides a degree of comfort on trading (in that it is not a warning), but another raft of reorganisation and repositioning provides further evidence of the complexity of this change process. For a Friday, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of company news around. Apart from Marks &amp; Spencer appointing Archie Norman as chairman which has lifted the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares by 5%, there is news that Richard Solomons, the chief executive of InterContinental Hotels is retiring and will be succeeded by chief commercial officer Keith Barr. The news was accompanied by news that revenue per available room - a key indicator for the hotel sector - had jumped from 1.7% in the fourth quarter to 2.7% for the first three months of the year. But this was less well received, with InterContinental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down more than 2%, making them the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. Analysts at Numis moved from hold to reduce, saying: The outperformance was mainly in Europe, which experienced a strong recovery in capital cities and benefited from a favourable trade fair calendar in Germany. Overall, first quarter growth was boosted by Easter falling in the second quarter which we estimate may have added 50-100 basis points to RevPAR. The fall in oil prices bring them back to an appropriate level given the fundamentals of the market, says Norbert R\u00c3\u00bccker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer : Concerns about the persistent supply glut and US production growth pressured prices, with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down move likely accelerated by long covering in the futures market. Scepticism about the effectiveness of the supply deal had grown in recent weeks with global oil inventories receding much slower than anticipated. The revived US shale boom undermines the Middle East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restriction efforts, among other sources of near-term supply growth. US oil production surpassed expectations in terms of an early bottoming and swift up tick, and is set to expand further based on the latest drilling momentum. Prices are back to fundamentally justified levels and should somewhat tame the latest shale boom frenzy, which is necessary for longer-term stability in the oil market. An extension of the supply deal beyond June looks likely but its effectiveness will remain questioned. The past months reveal the new oil market realities where the responsiveness and competitiveness of the US shale industry prevents prices from rising sustainably beyond $50 per barrel. On the other hand, we are unlikely to rewrite the story-book of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil collapse. We raise our view to neutral from bearish and roll our three-month price target to $47.5 from $50 per barrel. Moreover, with our target prices reached we close our short position in Brent futures initiated late January. Marks &amp; Spencer has appointed retail veteran Archie Norman as its new chairman. Norman, whose previous roles include Asda chief executive and ITV chairman, will take up the role from 1 September, replacing current chairman Robert Swannell who will retire from the board. Norman, 63, said: I am looking forward to taking on the role of the chairmanship of Marks &amp; Spencer as the business under Steve Rowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership faces into the considerable challenges ahead in a rapidly changing retail landscape. Investors have welcomed the news, with M&amp;S shares currently up 3.6%. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets have followed Asia lower in early trading, as the lower oil price weighs on shares. The scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,243 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 12,606 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.5% at 5,347 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 21,134 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,984 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 391 Another Brexit warning, this time from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest investment bank. Lloyd Blankfein said London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to the turmoil of the Brexit process. He told the BBC: [The City] will stall, it might backtrack a bit, it just depends on a lot of things about which we are uncertain and I know there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t certainty at the moment. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it will totally reverse. Blankfein said that he was hoping to avoid moving large numbers of staff out of the UK, but added the bank had held discussions in a number of European cities as part of Brexit contingency plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have big plans now, we are looking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are trying to avoid [it]. Obviously, a lot of people elect to have their European business concentrated in a single place, and the easiest place, certainly, for the biggest economy in the world [America] to concentrate would be the UK - the culture, the language, the special relationship, and we are an example of that. The price of Brent crude oil has not been lower since November 2016, before Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last agreement on production caps. The FTSE is expected to open lower this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brent crude is down a further 2% this morning at $47.51 a barrel, the lowest level in more than five months. So the sharp sell-off that began yesterday continues, and has driven shares lower in Asia, with the Hang Seng down 1% at 24,435. A combination of concerns about slowing demand from China, rising oil production in the US, and a lack of commitment to further supply cuts from the Opec oil producing nations, are all weighing on prices. US West Texas Intermediate crude oil was also down 1.9% at $44.66 per barrel. Another key focus today will be the April non-farm payrolls report in the US, which is due to be published at 13.30 UK time. It is expected to show a pick-up in job creation last month, with 185,000 jobs added, compared with just 98,000 in March. Analysts will also be looking for any revision to that weaker-than-expected March number.",

It does not make pretty reading: during that period, UK real wages fell by 1% a year on average.</p> <p>According to Tily\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis, Britain ranked 103rd out of 112 countries for which data was available. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that none of the other G7 countries enjoyed spectacular real wage growth either, but the UK was the only one that saw the value of pay packets decline. Of the 34 developed nations that are members of the OECD, the only one that saw weaker wage growth between 2008 and 2015 was Greece. Still, at least British workers did better than Venezuela (104th in the league table), the West Bank and Gaza (105th) and Iran (109th).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad9758391178d4026dd002ec87c630fb7baab95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ad9758391178d4026dd002ec87c630fb7baab95/0_0_660_248/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK 103rd out of 112 in global ranking for real wage growth since the crisis\" width=\"500\" height=\"188\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TUC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global ranking for real wage growth since the crisis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TUC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real wage performance in 2015 and 2016 was a lot better, not because the level of pay awards accelerated, but because inflation fell sharply as a result of the drop in global oil prices. But since last summer, a rebound in the cost of crude and the post-Brexit vote depreciation of sterling have led to rising inflation. Over the course of 2017, prices will grow more rapidly than pay and as a result, real wages will fall.</p> <p>May and her team would say a different league table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for employment growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shows the UK in a much better light. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, but in a successful economy, wages and employment grow simultaneously. That has been true of every upswing in living memory, apart from the current one.</p> <p>Real wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite tell the whole story, because purchasing power is also affected by government decisions on taxes and benefits. Here, the record of the past decade looks better, although only marginally. Real median income is currently 5% higher than it was in 2007-08, according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://election2017.ifs.org.uk/article/incomes-and-inequality-the-last-decade-and-the-next-parliament\">Institute for Fiscal Studies </a>but it would have risen by 15% had the pre-recession trend continued. This gap is set to widen over the next five years so that by 2021-22, real incomes will be 15 percentage points below where the IFS would have expected them to be. In real money, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year per household on average.</p> <p>So how strong is an economy where employment is only going up because workers are pricing themselves into jobs by taking real wage cuts, and employers are taking advantage of an abundance of low-cost labour to skimp on investment? The answer is not very strong at all. Indeed, what you really have is a low-productivity economy where large numbers of people rely on tax credits (now being made less generous) in order to make ends meet.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the fragility of the economy is underlined by its performance in the past three years. This, according to the government, is when things started to improve as a result of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd measures taken in 2010 to sort out the mess left behind by the last Labour government.</p> <p>But the period of relatively strong growth since the middle of 2012 has been based on two factors: the fall in oil prices, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/oil-plunges-to-lowest-level-for-five-months-amid-global-growth-fears\">since been partly reversed</a>, and the willingness of consumers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/uk-credit-cards-borrowing-debt-economic-crash-fears\">take on more debt</a>, which has limits. Growth this year will depend less on the housing market, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/28/uk-house-prices-april-brexit-inflation-wages-nationwide\">which has topped out</a> because property is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/01/smaller-deposits-raise-hopes-for-uk-first-time-homebuyers\">unaffordable for first-time buyers</a>, and more on the ability of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/31/sterlings-fall-lifts-uk-exports-figures-show\">exporters to take advantage</a> of the depreciated pound. That would be easier had more of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base survived the travails of the past four decades.</p> <p>The reality is that beneath the surface glitter, the UK has some deep economic problems, from chronically weak investment to profound regional imbalances and a persistent trade deficit. Ministers know this, although for the time being it suits them to pretend otherwise. </p> <p>The general election would not be taking place without the Brexit vote, and Brexit would not be happening had the economy been as strong as the government claims it to be. May has been stating the blindingly obvious when she says the economy is not working for far too many people. If it were otherwise, she would not be prime minister.</p>",

But GDP is an extremely crude measure, since it takes no account of increases in population or how any rise in national output is divided up. Wages and salaries provide a better guide to economic welfare. If pay packets are going up faster than inflation, our real incomes are rising. If inflation is rising faster than wage growth, real incomes are falling. Geoff Tily, a senior economist at the TUC, has constructed an international league table of real wage growth from 2008 to 2015 using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It does not make pretty reading: during that period, UK real wages fell by 1% a year on average. According to Tily\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis, Britain ranked 103rd out of 112 countries for which data was available. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that none of the other G7 countries enjoyed spectacular real wage growth either, but the UK was the only one that saw the value of pay packets decline. Of the 34 developed nations that are members of the OECD, the only one that saw weaker wage growth between 2008 and 2015 was Greece. Still, at least British workers did better than Venezuela (104th in the league table), the West Bank and Gaza (105th) and Iran (109th). The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real wage performance in 2015 and 2016 was a lot better, not because the level of pay awards accelerated, but because inflation fell sharply as a result of the drop in global oil prices. But since last summer, a rebound in the cost of crude and the post-Brexit vote depreciation of sterling have led to rising inflation. Over the course of 2017, prices will grow more rapidly than pay and as a result, real wages will fall. May and her team would say a different league table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for employment growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shows the UK in a much better light. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, but in a successful economy, wages and employment grow simultaneously. That has been true of every upswing in living memory, apart from the current one. Real wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite tell the whole story, because purchasing power is also affected by government decisions on taxes and benefits. Here, the record of the past decade looks better, although only marginally. Real median income is currently 5% higher than it was in 2007-08, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies but it would have risen by 15% had the pre-recession trend continued. This gap is set to widen over the next five years so that by 2021-22, real incomes will be 15 percentage points below where the IFS would have expected them to be. In real money, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year per household on average. So how strong is an economy where employment is only going up because workers are pricing themselves into jobs by taking real wage cuts, and employers are taking advantage of an abundance of low-cost labour to skimp on investment? The answer is not very strong at all. Indeed, what you really have is a low-productivity economy where large numbers of people rely on tax credits (now being made less generous) in order to make ends meet. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the fragility of the economy is underlined by its performance in the past three years. This, according to the government, is when things started to improve as a result of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd measures taken in 2010 to sort out the mess left behind by the last Labour government. But the period of relatively strong growth since the middle of 2012 has been based on two factors: the fall in oil prices, which has since been partly reversed, and the willingness of consumers to take on more debt, which has limits. Growth this year will depend less on the housing market, which has topped out because property is unaffordable for first-time buyers, and more on the ability of exporters to take advantage of the depreciated pound. That would be easier had more of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base survived the travails of the past four decades. The reality is that beneath the surface glitter, the UK has some deep economic problems, from chronically weak investment to profound regional imbalances and a persistent trade deficit. Ministers know this, although for the time being it suits them to pretend otherwise. The general election would not be taking place without the Brexit vote, and Brexit would not be happening had the economy been as strong as the government claims it to be. May has been stating the blindingly obvious when she says the economy is not working for far too many people. If it were otherwise, she would not be prime minister.",

                "bodyText":"The talking point in the dealing rooms was Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden sacking of FBI director James Comey, but the actual effect on the market was rather more limited. In Europe shares moved higher, and there was a similar story in the UK, while the decline in the US was fairly muted. An initial drop in the dollar did not last, and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move higher towards $1.30 was soon nipped in the bud as dealers looked forward to the Bank of England meeting on Thursday, expected to be fairly dovish. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 43.03 points or 0.59% at 7385.24 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.07% to 12,757.46 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.05% higher at 5400.46 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB ended 0.31% better at 21,552.81 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex dipped 0.13% to 11,034.8 In Greece, the Athens market closed higher for the twelfth day in a row, up 1.75% at 791.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 20 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude is now above $50 a barrel and on course for its best day since 1 December. It has jumped more than 3% to $50.27 in the wake of the bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks. West Texas Intermediate is currently up 3.44% at $47.46 a barrel. Still with oil, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: On a day largely devoid of major economic announcements, US crude inventories have grabbed the headlines late into the session. The EIA posted the largest drawdown of 2017 to date. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s API figure once more provided us with a useful guide to where we could see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EIA number. Despite recent fears that OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cuts may not be having an effect on inventories, it is clear that despite the odd outlier, the trend since the early February high has been towards reductions in stocks. Oil prices are moving higher following news of a bigger than expected decline in US crude stocks last week. They fell by 5.25m barrels to 522.53m, according to the Energy Information Administration, much higher than the forecast 1.8m decline. However gasoline stocks slipped by less than expected. But signs of increasing demand at a time when producers are struggling to contain supplies - Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cutbacks are being countered by rising US shale production - have lifted crude prices. Brent is up 2.2% at $49.81 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has added a similar amount to $46.89. The EIA figures followed a report from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a bigger than expected fall of 5.8m barrels last week compared to forecasts of a 2m barrel reduction. The news saw crude prices rally initially. However, gains were capped due to news of a large build in gasoline stockpiles. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the Comey sacking can hardly be described as dramatic (unlike the circumstances of the event itself). The US market falls are limited, and the dollar has recovered ground. The pound, for example, having looked as if it was going to breach the $1.3 level for the first time since September, is now down 0.02% at $1.2931. Investors are of course keeping Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting in mind, with the expectation that rates will remain unchanged and fading talk of a hawkish outlook. Meanwhile in Europe, markets are moving higher, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.17% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 0.06%. The FTSe 100 is currently up 0.67%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Comey controversy continued to be the main topic of discussion this Wednesday, though its impact on the market faded as the afternoon went on. The Dow Jones kicked off the US session 50 points lower, an improvement on the 80 point drop promised by the futures at points during the morning. The dollar also recovered the majority of its losses... That means Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal of the FBI director has transitioned from pressing concern to mild annoyance in the eyes of investors, if not for the health of American democracy. The shrinking of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth was a boost to the FTSE, which surged 40 points higher this Wednesday, nearing 7400 for the first time in a month. The thrust of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s momentum stems from the commodity sector; with Brent Crude tickling $49.50 per barrel BP and Shell both leapt 1% higher, while the mining stocks ignored copper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stagnation to instead focus on gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Tomorrow will push the pound back into the spotlight, however, as the Bank of England both votes on interest rates and reveals its latest inflation report. In the eurozone the DAX and CAC eventually shook off their early losses...And though Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to the Dutch House of Representatives didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily go down well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ECB chief was handed a solar-powered tulip to remind him of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make much difference to investors. As expected following the news that FBI director James Comey had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terminated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by President Trump, US stock markets have slipped back a little. But the falls are not dramatic, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 50 points or 0.24%, the Nasdaq Composite just 0.03% lower and the S&amp;P 500 off 0.06%. US markets are about to open, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking of FBI director James Comey: Meanwhile the Greek stock market continues to be lifted by the recent agreements between the country and its creditors. It is currently up just over 1%, meaning it is on track for a twelfth consecutive rise and is at a fresh 21 month high. Indeed, it is close to erasing all the losses since the Athens exchange was closed in June and July 2015 at the height of the crisis when banks were shut and capital controls imposed. Over in Greece, it appears that the International Monetary fund will finally sign up to the economic adjustment programme keeping debt-striken Greece afloat. Helena Smith reports from Athens: As financial rows go, it was one of the longest, most ill-kept secrets of all times. But now it seems the spat between the EU and IMF over how to deal with debt-stricken Greece finally has been put to rest with the latter agreeing to participate in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout programme. Attending the EBRD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting in Nicosia, Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever-loquacious finance minister Peter Kazimir said that, thanks to the Washington-based organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director Christine Lagarde, the IMF board had decided to join the programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems to me that yes, finally (the IMF will provide funding to Greece),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to congratulate Christine Lagarde that she managed to convince the IMF. This amount is not important, (but) it is really symbolic. Technically the IMF must be on board.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany had argued that without the IMF actively monitoring the programme, it would have trouble convincing the Bundestag to approve of further disbursement of loans. The IMF had countered that it would not sign up to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the third since Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near-economic implosion in late 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 staggering debt load was made sustainable. At 180% of GDP, the debt pile is by far the highest in the EU with the IMF saying that longer grace periods and maturity extensions are only likely to throw the problem into the long grass. But analysts now believe there are signs euro area finance ministers will revise Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-programme primary surplus in its debt sustainability analysis which would pay the way to minimal debt relief in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowing the IMF to come on board either at the next May 22 eurogroup meeting or by mid June at the latest. That, in turn, would allow emergency loans to be drawn down from the programme so that a fresh Greek crisis is avoided in July when Athens must honour debt repayments of over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn mostly to the ECB. In a genius touch, Dutch MPs ended Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session by handing him a solar-powered tulip! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to remind the ECB president of the danger of asset bubbles, such as the Tulip bulb mania of the 17th century in which bulbs changed hands for huge sums of money. Deliciously, the tulip was handed over by Pieter Duisenberg MP, son of the first president of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg. Back in the Netherlands, Mario Draghi is taking a terse line with MPs who are criticising his stimulus programme, insisting that it got millions of people back to work. Draghi is also being quizzed about whether the Netherlands could leave the single currency. He says the euro is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirreversible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (a stock answer). Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, as the Comey sacking continues to dominate the US news. Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breezy defence of the EBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convince all Dutch MPs; one has just told the ECB president that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no hero in Holland. Draghi seems unperturbed: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is addressing the Dutch parliament now, and dismissing criticism of his actions as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker. He starts by explaining how the ECB took \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive policy action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the eurozone debt crisis struck, by slashing interest rates to zero, imposing negative rates on banks, and buying tens of billions of euros of bonds each month. It worked, Draghi says, because: Since the start of 2013, inflation had drifted consistently away from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target rate of below but close to 2% over the medium term, reaching levels below 1%. Without counteracting measures, this low inflation could have turned into a deflationary spiral which would have deepened our economies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 woes considerably. Instead, we now see rising growth and inflation heading towards target: But...what about Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savers, who have seen returns collapse? Draghi sweeps these worries aside... An accommodative monetary policy means households accrue fewer nominal returns on their savings. However, an accommodative policy supports the economic recovery, which in turn bolsters employment, income, returns on investment and tax revenues. It therefore benefits households in their capacity as workers, entrepreneurs, investors, borrowers and taxpayers. Draghi also argues that banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grumble; OK, their profitability may suffer from low rates, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also spared rising delinquencies and defaults. And no Draghi speech is complete without a warning to Eurozone politicians to implement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambitious, country-specific, structural reforms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Most European stock markets are in the red now, as James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking helped to dampen the mood. Chris Beauchamp of IG say the lack of other news isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not every day that the US president fires the head of the FBI, so some of what we are seeing could be concerns about the political situation in the US, but overall a lack of macro catalysts and general exhaustion in equities is the main cause of the current drift in European stocks. Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chairman, John McFarlane, is now backing Jes Staley, arguing that trying to uncover a whistleblower wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that bad..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full quote from Barclays CEO Jes Staley about the impact of Brexit on its operations, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM meeting: While on the subject of the Investment Bank, I want to briefly touch on the question of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and how the Brexit vote might affect our European operations, because I know that is of interest to shareholders. The first thing to say is that we see this as a wholly manageable challenge. Our investment banking activities in Europe are certainly important to Barclays, and to our strategy, and we are committed to remaining a strong participant in that marketplace. To be clear, we believe the development of a single market for financial services in Europe, with the full participation of banks based in the UK, remains the best option for the UK economy and the best option for the European Union economy. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are a range of possible outcomes of the negotiations in the next 23 months, and we have looked closely at our options as to what we would do in various scenarios. We are confident that we have multiple choices for how we might continue to serve our customers and clients regardless of the outcome. But I have to say that compared to the complexity of standing up our US Intermediate Holding Company, as we did on July 1st of last year, let alone establishing a ring-fenced bank in the UK from scratch, as we are currently doing, any of the options we might need to pursue are by comparison straightforward, and significantly less costly. Finally, we do not currently see a need in our options to shift British jobs or significant operations elsewhere. If we require a build-up of capability in another European Union jurisdiction as part of our plans then we can do so, and we will. Looking away from the markets briefly, Barclay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under-fire CEO has apologised to shareholders for trying to unmask a whistleblower. Jes Staley held his hands up (metaphorically) at Barclay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM in London this morning, saying he shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have got involved. Last month, it emerged that Staley had tried to use Barclay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal security team to find whoever had sent anonymous letters criticising a senior employer he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d brought to the bank. Staley also played down the idea that Barclays might move jobs overseas because Britain is leaving the European Union. My colleague Jill Treanor is tweeting from the shareholder meeting: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Edward Luce has written a snappy outline of James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking: Like any US federal scandal, the details mount but the basics remain simple. Having fired the head of the only Russia investigation taking place within the executive branch, Mr Trump will now conduct a search for Mr Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement. What are the chances he selects an independent figure who will pick up the Russia investigation where Mr Comey left off? What are the odds Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FBI nominee gets the necessary fifty votes for Senate confirmation? Mr Trump will be aided in his search by Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, who was forced to recuse himself from overseeing Mr Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation because of his undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador. This was the same ambassador with whom Michael Flynn, Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first national security adviser, held conversations secretly recorded by the FBI. The leaked contents of those, in turn, led to Mr Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing. Like any US federal scandal, the details mount but the basics remain simple. These are just the outlines. The key point is that Mr Trump has fired the man investigating him. Nixon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saturday night massacre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which he fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor, is the only precedent. More here: Comey falls victim to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tuesday night massacre James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entirely without precedent; Bill Clinton fired FBI director William Sessions in 1993 following a critical report into Sessions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performance and conduct. But Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abrupt exit may remind older readers of another incident - the notorious Saturday Night Massacre of October 1973. That was the moment Richard Nixon had special prosecutor Archibald Cox fired, rather than hand over Oval Office recordings to the inquiry into the Watergate burglary. Cox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal only occurred after the attorney general and his deputy resigned rather than obey Nixon, and is a textbook example of elected politicians interfering in the judicial process (Nixon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subsequent resignation is a reminder that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always work out either....) My colleague Julian Borger has written about the comparisons with Watergate here: Jasper Lawler of London Capital Markets says memories of the Saturday Night Massacre are weighing on investors today, as they digest the news that Trump has fired the man investigating his advisor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ties with Russia. He told Sky News that: Markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want Donald Trump to have his own Watergate scandal. This very much reminds us of Nixon firing Cox.... Anything that can upset the reflation trade, the infrastructure spending, the tax cut that Trump is trying to get through is not good for markets Having a big political scandal would be one thing that could disrupt that. The British pound is close to hitting $1.30 for the first time since last September. Bloomberg shows how sterling is leading the charge against the US dollar today: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Gapper mischievously tweets that the US president had warned that the dollar was too strong... Naeem Aslam of Think Markets is also concerned that Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking will seriously undermine Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get things done: For investors, this news matters, because President Trump needs to make alliance with both parties in order to have a swifter path for his tax reform bill to pass. Any unnecessary escalation of tension doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide much aid to bolster investor sentiment. The last thing they want to see is the tax bill to drag on its heel forever and the nightmare of repealing the Obamacare returns. This chart shows how the dollar reacted to Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal: Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock sacking is the main topic of conversation in the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading rooms, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much for investors to work with this morning, the main news being Donald Trump going all Apprentice on FBI director James Comey. While Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock dismissal doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t technically have any immediate consequences for the market, it is another reminder of the unpredictable and irresponsible nature of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governance. The news has weighed on the dollar, which fell by 0.4% against the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with cable continuing to tease 1.30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 0.2% against both the euro and the Japanese yen. The Dow futures are also down, shedding another 50 points as the index heads back towards 20900. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what New York traders will wake up to: James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden dismissal last night has stunned US politicians from across both parties, with some calling for a special prosecutor to investigate links between Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies and Russia. This means it is a serious issue for investors too, as UBS analyst Paul Donovan explains: Ordinarily the dismissal would not matter to markets, but the move might be regarded as further evidence of presidential unpredictability (which markets dislike). It may impact relations with Congress, and relations with Russia; both have market relevance. Without Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support, Trump will struggle to deliver his promised infrastructure spending boost, or push through his controversial tax reforms. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the US president has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thrown another spanner into the works\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This could impact approval of the stimulus policy markets are hankering after. Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo, says Asian traders were unnerved by the news: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Comey news is being treated as a risk-off event, and the headlines were sparking the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US dollar is coming under pressure this morning after Donald Trump shocked America, and beyond, by firing the director of the FBI. The sudden dismissal of James Comey has given the markets a jolt, with some analysts citing it as an example of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erratic approach. The dollar is down against the pound, sending sterling up to $1.298. The selloff has also sent the euro back towards $1.09. Emerging market currencies, such as the South African rand, are also benefitting. Trump told Comey yesterday that he was fired over his handling over Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails, and that the FBI needed new leadership. But as we reported last night, the move has also intensified the focus on Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities around the US election: The move came as CNN reported that a grand jury had begun issuing subpoenas to associates of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser at the centre of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. If confirmed, the report suggests that the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into the Trump camp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links with Moscow has entered a significant new phase. Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking, which was condemned by one Senate Democrat as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nixonian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, raised concerns over the independence of the investigation and prompted vociferous demands for a special prosecutor to be appointed. RBC Capital Market believes the move will weigh on Wall Street when trading begins later today. Donald Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terminated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd FBI Director James Comey, calling for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new beginning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US stock futures slipped as a result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are hovering around record highs today, as traders continue to take comfort from the French election result But what will Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory mean for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out what Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, thinks when he testifies to the Dutch parliament around noon today. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities believes Draghi could push the euro higher. In the past Mario Draghi has been overly optimistic about the growth prospects of the Euro area but today improvements in the data may support his view. From Sunday the European currency has dropped from its 1.1000 heights to trade as low as 1.0870, so his speech may be a trigger for some of these losses to be recovered. Investors are also wondering whether the market rally can keep going. Last night, tech giant Apple became the first company to ever be worth $800bn - putting it on track for a $1 trillion market cap before the year is out. And earlier today, the Hong Kong Hang Seng index broke through the 25,000-point mark on Wednesday for the first time in nearly two years. European markets are expected to be calm this morning: Market volatility has fallen to its lowest levels since 1993, a sign of optimism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and possibly complacency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seeping across the trading floors. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock sacking of FBI director James Comey has served as as reminder that shocks are always around the corner... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Economists have hailed Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic resilience after it grew by 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, twice as fast as the UK and France. Business investment, consumer spending and exports all helped Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expand at a faster pace, up from 0.4% in Q4 2016. Some experts say it confirms that Germany is still getting a competitive boost from the euro, which makes its exports more attractive to buyers outside the single currency. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to benefit from strong consumer confidence, with the University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer sentiment index rising again. But US retail sales grew less than expected last month, and core inflation dipped - leaving Wall Street traders wondering if US interest rates may rise more gently than expected this year. Britons woke up to fresh talk of falling real wages this year, and warnings that jobs and investment will be lost if a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmooth Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be achieved. But the country can also cheer its biggest ever investment in a private company, after virtual simulation firm Improbable nailed a $500m investment. Learn more here: Thanks for reading and commenting. Hope you have a great weekend. GW European stock markets have closed for the week, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index leading the way. The FTSE 100 finished 48 points higher at 7435, a gain of 0.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just 12 points shy of its record intraday high, set in mid-March, and a new all-time closing high. The French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.5%. But Chris Beauchamp of IG sounds nervous, and suggests that the rally could be petering out..... It cannot be said to have been the most exciting week in stock markets, despite the FTSE 100 touching its highest level in over seven weeks..... With US earnings season out of the way, it looks like investors are fast running out of reasons to buy stocks. The attempt at a rally from earlier in the week has fizzled out, and while the decline has yet to turn into a full-blown rout, the number of fallers continues to outnumber the gainers, a sign that all is not well beneath the surface of the S&amp;P 500. US consumer sentiment is still sky-high, says Michael Pearce of Capital Economics, thanks to the stock market rally and strong jobs market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the Michigan confidence report: The small increase in the University of Michigan measure of consumer confidence leaves it at a level consistent with consumption growth rebounding to over 5% annualised in the second quarter. Spending growth is unlikely to rise quite that sharply, but this still suggests that the weak 0.3% annualised gain in the first quarter was a one-off. The slight rise in the headline measure to 97.7 in May, from 97.0 was a little better than the consensus forecast for no change. The high level of consumer confidence is consistent with the strength of its underlying drivers; labour market conditions are healthy, the stock market is close to a record high, and gasoline prices have remained low. US consumer confidence has risen has people become more optimistic about economic prospects. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closely watched confidence index, which has jumped to 97.7 from 97.0 in April, beating forecasts of a smaller rise to 97.2. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tracker of current conditions was unchanged at 112.7, but the expectations gauge rose pretty sharply, to 88.1 from 87.0. There are a couple of sharp moves on the London stock market today. Pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca has surged 9% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after reporting that its immunotherapy drug, durvalumab, has been found to cut the risk of death in patients with advanced lung cancer. But Petrofac, which provides services to the oil industry, has slumped by 13% after telling shareholders that its chief executive and chief operating officer have been questioned by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO says the inquiry relates to an investigation into Monaco-based Unaoil, related to allegations of possible money-laundering and bribery. Wall Street has just opened, cautiously, for the final trading day of the week. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 both dipped a little, while the Nasdaq is creeping a little higher as the rally in tech stocks continues. The dollar is coming under pressure, too, following the drop in core inflation an hour ago. That shows that traders are reassessing their expectations for US interest rate hikes this year. The drop in US core inflation last month is a headache for the Federal Reserve, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He says: To some extent, this new weakness in price inflation is due to competitive pressures rather than weak demand, so the Fed can afford to discount it. But even under those circumstances, it increases the downside risks to our above-consensus view that the Fed will hike interest rates three more times this year. The US retail sales figures are a somewhat mixed bag. Retail spending rose by 0.4% in April, new figures show, missing forecasts of a 0.6% rise. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised to a 0.1% rise in spending, not the 0.2% fall previously estimated. Sales of furniture and home furnishings dipped by 0.5%, while spending on electrical goods and appliances rose by 1.3%. Associated Press has a good take: The increase suggests that consumers may spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and JC Penney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns rather than broader economic weakness. Sales at department stores fell 0.2 percent. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. Here comes the deluge of US economic data.... ....and consumer prices rose by 0.2% month-on-month in April, bang in line with forecasts. That follows a 0.3% drop in March. Housing, energy, tobacco, and food all contributed to the monthly increase in inflation, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The energy index gained 1.1% and the food index rose 0.2 percent, mostly due to a sharp increase in the index for fresh vegetables. The annual rate of CPI came in at 2.2%, down from 2.4% in March. But significantly, annual core inflation (stripping out food and energy) fell to 1.9%. A few more photos from the G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Bari have arrived. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan told reporters that Italy is pushing for more measures to fight inequality, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inclusive growth means first of all that growth has to be shared with all segment and regions of society,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christine Lagarde is also in Bari, and pushing European leaders to give more specific commitments to Greece on debt relief. Lagarde says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will carry on working on this debt relief package. There is not enough clarity yet but I hope that the European partners will continue to progress in that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde added that the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on Greece has not changed, effectively dismissing reports that the Fund had agreed to join the bailout. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is due in no small part to the euro, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the single currency gives German exporters an extra competitive they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have with the Deutsche Mark (which would surely trade at a higher exchange rate if it still existed). Kapadia says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The German economy is firing on all cylinders, delivering a robust economic performance across all sectors supported by a surge in business investments and higher consumer spending. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross domestic product grew at a quarterly clip of 0.6%, or 2.4% in annualized terms, outpacing the likes of Britain and France comfortably. The country may well be the top performer in the G7. The only other major competitor could be Canada. One of the most important factors to note here is that German trade is strong and helped by a undervalued Euro, consistently delivering a trade surplus. It is now one of the most steady markets in Europe and amongst developed economies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a great morning, as worries over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy linger. Sterling has lost 0.25% this morning to $1.2843, a one-week low. Yesterday, the Bank of England trimmed its growth forecasts and warned that wages will lag behind inflation this year (a message we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard again this morning). Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound was down against major peers today despite the strength seen over the past week, mainly due to the reduction of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts for 2017 which were cut from 2% to 1.9%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth in the last quarter is partly down to Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open-door policy on refugees, argues Timo Klein, principal German economist at IHS Markit. Klein writes: Private consumption continues to be underpinned by the ongoing improvement in labour market and income conditions and should thus overcome the recent setback related to the surge in headline inflation that has reduced real purchasing power. Government consumption is being supported by expenditures for refugees. Meanwhile, the construction sector may have received an extra boost in Q1 from a mild winter, which will trigger a recoil effect in Q2, but a combination of large demographic pressure for residential building (including pent-up demand), persistently favorable financing conditions, and government efforts to boost infrastructure investment will ensure strong growth impulses from this sector for many quarters to come. Klein also believes German businesses have shed their worries over Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, which is why they boosted capital spending. Investors seem to have come to the conclusion that the threat of US president Trump disrupting global trade patterns via protectionist measures has been overblown. Back in the UK, a software developer specialising in virtual simulation is celebrating after securing the biggest financing round for a private British company. Improbable, set up by a group of 2o-something Cambridge computer science graduates, has raised over $500bn from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Softbank. That values the company at over $1bn - putting it in Unicorn territory. Improbable uses distributed computing power, or cloud computing, to create virtual worlds and accurate simulations of the real world. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the deal: And with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunlimited vacation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, free meals, social events and flexible working, Improbable sounds like quite the model of a modern tech firm.... With strong growth figures in his pocket, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister is calling on America to deliver strong leadership to help the world economy. Arriving in Bari for a meeting of G7 finance ministers, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble told reporters that his message to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is: We need a strong United States to lead the global economy and global politics on a sustainable way. Mnuchin has also arrived in Bari, sporting a fine pair of shades and hailing the new trade agreement reached with China overnight. He told the press pack that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re excited about US trade policies and I think you probably saw last night we made an announcement of a100-day economic plan with the Chinese so I think we are very happy with how we are proceeding on trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As mentioned earlier, the new deal will open China up to US credit rating agencies and credit card companies, and also allow American farmers to export beef to Chinese consumers. Ho hum. The latest eurozone industrial production figures have just landed, and at first glance they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re weaker than expected. Industrial output across the euro area fell by 0.1% in March, dragged down by weak energy production, dashing hopes of a rise. Dig into the data, though, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more encouraging. Output of goods for consumers and businesses actually rose. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details, via Eurostat Energy production: Down by 3.2% month-on-month Capital goods: Up by 0.2% Intermediate goods: Up by 0.3% Durable consumer goods Up by 0.9% Non-durable consumer goods: Up by 2.1%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, agrees that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report has cheered the City. He writes: This morning has started in positive fashion for the Eurozone, in what is fast becoming the go-to growth driver of the western world. The outperformance of German Q1 GDP should have come as no surprise given the positive signs coming out of the industrial powerhouse over recent months. With the French hoping to strengthen their economy in the wake of Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory, there appears to be an end to the sight of the protracted downturn seen in the eurozone since the 2007 financial crisis. The pick-up in German growth should reassure global investors, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been throwing money into Europe in recent weeks. As this chart shows, investors have been buying European shares for several weeks now - with a record surge following the French presidential election: Following a fresh warning on living standards from the Bank of England on Thursday, two leading economists have warned this morning that Britons will all be poorer over the next five years as Brexit delivers a blow to the economy. Andrew Lilico, executive director of Europe Economics, said that Britain will probably lose out on a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of growth over the next few years, before expanding at a faster pace in the 2020s. Lilico told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Today programme: Few things in life involving major changes come cost free so I think we should expect to lose a couple of percentage points of GDP growth - the equivalent of one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth over the period of 2019/2020. Then in the 2020s I expect it to grow a little bit faster and by 2030 everything will have come out in the wash.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, agreed that UK households would be worse off over the next five years but was less optimistic about a swift turnaround in fortunes thereafter. The real effect of Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen until Brexit happens. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic that Britain can secure a free trade agreement with Europe, but it will take at least 10 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are no smooth arrangements we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see a sharp decrease in investment and therefore a sharp decrease in jobs and that will mean a much more serious reduction in household incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust growth has helped European stock markets to gain some ground in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has gained 24 points, or 0.2%, and the other main indices are also up a little: Only Canada can prevent Germany from claiming the title of becoming the fastest growing major economy in the first quarter of 2017. Nina Adam of the Wall Street Journal explains: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accelerated in the first quarter, driven by a revival in global trade and buoyant construction activity. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross domestic product grew at a quarterly clip of 0.6%, or 2.4% in annualized terms, the Destatis statistics office said Friday. This met economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts and meant Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy comfortably outpaced the U.S., which expanded by 0.7% annualized in the first quarter. The U.K., Japan, France and Italy also recorded lower growth rates than Germany. Canada is the only Group of Seven country that may record a stronger first-quarter result when it publishes its estimate in late May. We have further good news on the European economy, via France. The French employment total has hit its highest level since the financial crisis, after jumping by almost 50,000 in the last quarter to 16.228 million. The service sector drove the recovery, creating 56,200 net new jobs, while 4,800 jobs were lost in industry and 2,000 in construction. This is the seventh quarter of net job creation in a row, indicating that president-elect Emmanuel Macron will inherit a strengthening economy. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report also provides fresh ammunition to critics - such as the Trump administration - who claim Germany is getting an unfair advantage from a weak currency. Certainly, the jump in exports in Q1 indicates that German trade is humming. That means Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus (another cause of concern) will remain around record levels. Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger believes. the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme is clearly helping, saying: A boom without end in Germany... and despite all the risks. However, it should be noted that the economy would be humming less without the support of interest rates which are too low for Germany.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contain any sign that Brexit is hurting Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The surge in business investment shows that German business leaders are planning for future growth, while higher consumer spending suggests families aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried either. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, is also impressed with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy seems to be firing on all cylinders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Germany is on track for a decent year, according to Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover. Kramer says (via Bloomberg): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic momentum is extremely robust and very broadly based,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The steady increase in employment is fertile soil for domestic demand, and trade is providing impulses as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says Germany achieved broad-based growth in the last quarter - with decent weather helping to deliver that 0.6% growth. The FT points out that Germany outperformed its international rivals in the last quarter: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth rate was below 0.2% in Q1, while the UK and France both grew by 0.3%. Howard Archer of IHS Markit has tweeted the key points: Breaking: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew twice as fast as Britain at the start of 2017. German GDP expanded by 0.6% in the January-March quarter, up from 0.4% in the final three months of 2016. The growth was driven by higher business investment on new equipment and buildings, plus higher spending by consumers and the government. Strong exports also helped Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerhouse economy make a robust start to the year. The Federal Statistics Office says: Capital formation [business spending] increased substantially. Due to the mild weather, fixed capital formation especially in construction, but also in machinery and equipment was markedly up compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Households and general government increased their final consumption expenditure slightly at the beginning of the year. In addition, the development of foreign trade was more dynamic and contributed to growth as exports increased more than imports, according to provisional results. In contrast, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP only rose by 0.3% during the first quarter, as the UK service sector suffered a slowdown. But on an annual basis, the picture is different. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q1 growth was 1.7% higher than a year earlier (once you adjust for seasonal factors), while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was 2.1% higher, year-on-year. More details and reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking at Germany, as GDP figures for the first three months of this year are released at 7am BST. Economists predict growth of around 0.6%, after various soft data has suggested the German economy began strongly. At 10am, the latest eurozone industrial production report is expected to show growth of 0.3% for March. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is also in focus, with inflation and retail sales figures at 1.30pm BST. Headline inflation is expected to dip to 2.3%, from 2.4%, while retail sales are tipped to rise by 0.5% after falling in February and March. Traders are also digesting the news that America and China have signed a new trade agreement -- perhaps a sign of warming relations between the two powers. From Beijing, Tom Phillips reports: Relations between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies have hit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce secretary has claimed, announcing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153herculean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade deal between Washington and Beijing in the latest sign of warming ties. Under the agreement China will allow imports of US beef, while the US will allow the import of cooked poultry from China. Beijing will also permit foreign financial services companies to provide credit-rating services in China. European stock markets are expected to open calmly, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 called up a modest 1 point. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

A \u00c2\u00a325m arts centre to be built on a derelict plot that had not felt a cultural pulse since the closure, 15 years earlier, of the legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/02/how-we-made-hacienda-club\">Ha\u00c3\u00a7ienda nightclub</a>. It would be called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/home-in-manchester\">Home</a>, formed by the merger of two proud but financially imperilled institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the <a href=\"https://homemcr.org/about/history/cornerhouse/\">Cornerhouse</a> cinema and gallery, and the <a href=\"https://homemcr.org/about/history/library-theatre-company/\">Library Theatre Company</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and would, its backers hoped, revive a forgotten corner on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern edge.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was confidence from the city leadership that it would work, but a lot of my peers and colleagues in the arts were saying to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go there?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sheena Wrigley, executive director of Home, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and bar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a very unprepossessing area with a big car park and one large office block. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visible or on a main thoroughfare.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Programming would swim far from the mainstream, too. The centre opened in May 2015 with a challenging play about two thwarted lovers trying to survive a recession in a city like Manchester.

The free gallery includes an exhibition of vibrant art from post-Franco Spain and an exploration of the role of <a href=\"https://homemcr.org/exhibition/house-ghetto-black-pride/\">vogueing in gay black culture</a>.</p> <p>Wrigley admits to having been nervous when she and her team set an ambitious target of 550,000 visits for the first year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we smashed that in six months and did just shy of a million,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. And they kept coming: as Home approaches its second birthday, it is about to welcome its two-millionth visitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fascinating to me that you can open a venue of this kind and size and it can find its audience straight away in a difficult period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wrigley adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, I would like to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about good artistic choices, but something else is going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Wrigley is right. A series of studies is revealing strange things about our spending habits. They call it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which gives it the sense of a grand theory. And there is science behind it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very simple: regardless of political uncertainty, austerity and inflation, we are spending more on doing stuff, choosing instead to cut back on buying stuff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95fc37ab44d69fb0596a4c347c545d577cd7a148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95fc37ab44d69fb0596a4c347c545d577cd7a148/0_40_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"The restaurant at Home, a new arts centre in Manchester.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The restaurant at Home, a major new arts centre in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest figures come from Barclaycard, which processes about half of all Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit and debit card transactions.

In March, Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, blamed the clothing chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/next-price-rises-profits-fall-pound-brexit\">first fall in profits for eight years</a> on the move from buying things to doing things. More startlingly, Ikea, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest furniture retailer, told a Guardian conference last year that consumption of many goods had reached a limit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we look on a global basis, in the west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/weve-hit-peak-home-furnishings-says-ikea-boss-consumerism\">we have probably hit peak stuff</a>,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Steve Howard, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of sustainability.</p> <p>It would be easy to assume that contemporary influences are at work here. The world is a bit of a depressing place right now, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a nice evening out rather than buy a sixth pair of shoes. But theories abound of a much broader shift. And Ikea is arguably late in calling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peak stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2011, Chris Goodall, a British environment writer, used government data called the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsmaterialflowsaccountunitedkingdom\">Material Flows Account</a> to track consumption of stuff, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/31/consumption-of-goods-falling\">identified 2001 as a tipping point, long before the 2008 recession</a> and everything that followed. He believed we had <a href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/545e40d0e4b054a6f8622bc9/t/54720c6ae4b06f326a8502f9/1416760426697/Peak_Stuff_17.10.11.pdf\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153decoupled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic growth and material consumption</a>.</p> <p>And as we consume less, we are doing more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you think about the 20th century, the big dominant value system was materialism, the belief that if we had more stuff we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be happier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says James Wallman, a trend forecaster and the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/07/stuffocation-living-more-with-less-james-wallman-review\">Stuffocation: Living More with Less</a>, in which he charts the move from possessions to experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big change to what I call experientialism is more about finding happiness and status in experiences instead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The happiness bit perhaps stands to reason, but studies suggest the anticipation of an experience has a crucial, additional value. In a 2014 paper called <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614546556\">Waiting for Merlot</a>, psychologists Amit Kumar, Thomas Gilovich and Matthew Killingsworth showed how people report being mostly frustrated before the planned purchase of a thing, but mostly happy before they bought an experience. That feeling lingers longer, too, tied up as it is with memory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We call it hedonic adaptation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Colin Strong, the head of behavioural science at Ipsos, the market research group. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the hedonic payoff of experiences is much greater.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>We are also less likely to compare experiential purchases than we are products, in a way that means we are all happy with what we buy, regardless of what we can afford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So if you have a Nissan and your neighbour has a Porsche, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt who has the better car, and if you ask the Nissan driver to swap, they will,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wallman says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But if you ask people who went on holiday to the Seychelles or south Wales, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear who had the fancier holiday, but surveys show the person who went to Wales won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swap because they had an equally good time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>If the experience economy has a levelling effect, research also suggests that part of the reason for its rise is its greater potential as a status booster.<strong> </strong>This supports the idea, questioned by some (and not backed up by Barclaycard, which does not account for age), that younger people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely millennials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are driving the consumer shift. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It used to be that our car, or handbag or wallet showed our status. Now we post Facebook pictures from a chairlift in Chamonix or the latest music festival,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wallman says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social media is supporting this change. Posting pictures of what you just bought is gauche; posting pictures of something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing is fine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Strong also thinks the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly impoverished nature of millennials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is compelling them to get out more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c5e628b4e19fb8c0551a66f8989124da5300e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c5e628b4e19fb8c0551a66f8989124da5300e1/0_62_4900_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"couple on beach at sunset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt used to be that our car or handbag showed our status.

                "bodyText":"It was an audacious plan for an unloved bit of Manchester. A \u00c2\u00a325m arts centre to be built on a derelict plot that had not felt a cultural pulse since the closure, 15 years earlier, of the legendary Ha\u00c3\u00a7ienda nightclub. It would be called Home, formed by the merger of two proud but financially imperilled institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Cornerhouse cinema and gallery, and the Library Theatre Company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and would, its backers hoped, revive a forgotten corner on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern edge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was confidence from the city leadership that it would work, but a lot of my peers and colleagues in the arts were saying to me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go there?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sheena Wrigley, executive director of Home, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and bar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a very unprepossessing area with a big car park and one large office block. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visible or on a main thoroughfare.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Programming would swim far from the mainstream, too. The centre opened in May 2015 with a challenging play about two thwarted lovers trying to survive a recession in a city like Manchester. This week the cinema is showing Lady Macbeth, a subversive Shakespearean noir, and The Handmaiden, an erotic Korean period thriller. The free gallery includes an exhibition of vibrant art from post-Franco Spain and an exploration of the role of vogueing in gay black culture. Wrigley admits to having been nervous when she and her team set an ambitious target of 550,000 visits for the first year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we smashed that in six months and did just shy of a million,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. And they kept coming: as Home approaches its second birthday, it is about to welcome its two-millionth visitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fascinating to me that you can open a venue of this kind and size and it can find its audience straight away in a difficult period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wrigley adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, I would like to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about good artistic choices, but something else is going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wrigley is right. A series of studies is revealing strange things about our spending habits. They call it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which gives it the sense of a grand theory. And there is science behind it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very simple: regardless of political uncertainty, austerity and inflation, we are spending more on doing stuff, choosing instead to cut back on buying stuff. The latest figures come from Barclaycard, which processes about half of all Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit and debit card transactions. Figures for April show a 20% increase in spending in pubs compared with the same month last year. Spending in restaurants went up 16%, while theatres and cinemas enjoyed a 13% rise. Meanwhile, department stores suffered a 1% drop, vehicle sales were down 11% and spending on household appliances fell by 2.5%. Barclaycard says the trend began to emerge about a year ago. And retailers are feeling it. In March, Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, blamed the clothing chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first fall in profits for eight years on the move from buying things to doing things. More startlingly, Ikea, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest furniture retailer, told a Guardian conference last year that consumption of many goods had reached a limit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Steve Howard, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of sustainability. It would be easy to assume that contemporary influences are at work here.

At his wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prompting, he has just acquired a second pair of trousers, but is holding out with his one pair of shoes and five holey T-shirts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather do things,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I took the kids to the Natural History Museum on Sunday.

But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another day of records for the FTSE100 and the German DAX, as they both put in new record highs, however the glacially slow progress above these new highs is a little worrying, which might suggest some investor nervousness at embarking on aggressive buying at such elevated levels.</p> <p>The sectors receiving a boost included oil and mining, while computer security stocks were also in demand after the cyber attack. Sophos jumped more than 7% while cybersecurity exchange-traded fund ISE rose more than 3%. The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 18.98 points or 0.26% at 7454.37, having earlier reached a new all time peak of 7460</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.29% to a record close of 12,807.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.22% at 5417.40</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.6% to 21,704.46</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 10,957.8</strong></li> <li><strong>In Athens, the Greek market slipped 0.86% to 782.32</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.39% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new intra-day highs. </p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first point to make is that this has not radically altered the outlook for oil prices. An extension of up to six months had already been widely anticipated, so this is simply a little longer than expected. That may be why oil prices rose by only about 3% today, whereas they rose by around 15% when the cuts were originally agreed at the end of November 2016. Brent crude remains comfortably within the $45 to $60pb range in which it has been trading since last November.</p> <p>Further ahead, we think the agreement will help to lift Brent crude prices towards our forecast of $60pb by year-end. Even allowing for compliance slipping a bit and US shale production continuing to exceed expectations, these cuts should be enough to rebalance the oil market and bring oil stocks down.</p> <p> Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement also reinforces our view that oil prices will be far more stable in the coming years than they have been since 2014. Significant price rises would probably lead to weaker compliance by OPEC and Russia, as well as to higher shale production. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other big producers would probably extend their production cuts again if prices were to fall.</p> <p>As we have argued before, the current range for oil prices of around $45-60 per barrel is probably a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Goldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario for the world economy. This is high enough to keep major producers afloat and to justify the recent rebound in investment in the energy sector. However, as it is well below the $100-plus level which appeared to be normal a few years ago, it is also comfortable for consumers. All told, the outlook for oil prices remains consistent with our forecasts for steady global growth and low inflation. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5919bbf3e4b0f5ae171e24da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T14:34:20.026Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is still heading for a record closing high, although it is currently off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best levels, but with a raft of UK economic data due this week, the question is whether the index can maintain its good run. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, sayd:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The index hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite been able to climb back to the 7460 all-time intraday high it hit soon after the bell; however, it is still lurking around the 7450 mark, keeping it on track to close at a new record peak. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly thanks to its buoyant commodity sector; Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5% surge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Putin throwing his backing behind the continuation of an oil-output cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has obviously lifted the oil stocks, while the miners were pleased with the announcement of a $900 billion infrastructure spend in China.</p> <p>It is going to be interested to see if the FTSE can hold onto that growth tomorrow. The latest inflation figure is released on Tuesday morning and, with analysts expecting the reading to climb from 2.3% to 2.6% month-on-month, the pound could be in for a bit of a boost. Since Brexit that has tended to mean bad news for the UK index, though it is worth noting that cable has managed to keep its head above $1.29 without troubling the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-breaking rise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5919b355e4b0762dda0bb1af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T14:15:09.335Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More positive news from the US housing market.</p> <p>The National Association of Homebuilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has climbed to 70 in April, compared to the 68 level reached in March and expected to be repeated last month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/calculatedrisk/status/864122857797828610\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NAHB: Builder Confidence increased to 70 in May <a href=\"https://t.co/FqClWotZMs\">https://t.co/FqClWotZMs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/E38IAgsALs\">pic.twitter.com/E38IAgsALs</a></p>&mdash; Bill McBride (@calculatedrisk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/calculatedrisk/status/864122857797828610\">May 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T14:19:49.467Z\">at 3.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5919ae91e4b0f5ae171e249a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T13:38:15.865Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are also benefiting from the rise in oil prices, with investors shrugging off the worldwide cyber attack which began on Friday.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 62 points or 0.3% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened more than 0.1% better, with the latter at a new record high.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5919a86ce4b0f5ae171e2471\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-15T13:17:55.806Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Moody's keeps stable outlook on Greek banks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-maintains-stable-outlook-on-the-Greek-banking-system-amid--PR_366708\">credit rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has kept its stable outlook on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks,</a> citing the improved prospects for profitability.</p> <p>But it warned that problem loans remained high and were a severe challenge for Greek banks, although they should start declining from around 45% of gross loans at the end of 2016 over the next 12 to 18 months.</p> <p>Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added that it expected Greek banks to remain marginally profitable in 20179-2018, although the operating environment would remain challenging.

                "bodyText":"A surge in the oil price, a boost from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $900bn infrastructure plans and a victory for Angela Merkel in a key German state election combined to push markets higher, despite the worries caused by the global cyber attack. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another day of records for the FTSE100 and the German DAX, as they both put in new record highs, however the glacially slow progress above these new highs is a little worrying, which might suggest some investor nervousness at embarking on aggressive buying at such elevated levels. The sectors receiving a boost included oil and mining, while computer security stocks were also in demand after the cyber attack. Sophos jumped more than 7% while cybersecurity exchange-traded fund ISE rose more than 3%. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 18.98 points or 0.26% at 7454.37, having earlier reached a new all time peak of 7460 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.29% to a record close of 12,807.04 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.22% at 5417.40 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.6% to 21,704.46 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 10,957.8 In Athens, the Greek market slipped 0.86% to 782.32 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.39% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new intra-day highs. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. News from Saudi Arabia and Russia that they favour extending the current oil production cuts until March 2018 is not a game changer but should help stabilise crude prices, according to Capital Economics. Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: The first point to make is that this has not radically altered the outlook for oil prices. An extension of up to six months had already been widely anticipated, so this is simply a little longer than expected. That may be why oil prices rose by only about 3% today, whereas they rose by around 15% when the cuts were originally agreed at the end of November 2016. Brent crude remains comfortably within the $45 to $60pb range in which it has been trading since last November. Further ahead, we think the agreement will help to lift Brent crude prices towards our forecast of $60pb by year-end. Even allowing for compliance slipping a bit and US shale production continuing to exceed expectations, these cuts should be enough to rebalance the oil market and bring oil stocks down. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement also reinforces our view that oil prices will be far more stable in the coming years than they have been since 2014. Significant price rises would probably lead to weaker compliance by OPEC and Russia, as well as to higher shale production. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other big producers would probably extend their production cuts again if prices were to fall. As we have argued before, the current range for oil prices of around $45-60 per barrel is probably a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Goldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario for the world economy. This is high enough to keep major producers afloat and to justify the recent rebound in investment in the energy sector. However, as it is well below the $100-plus level which appeared to be normal a few years ago, it is also comfortable for consumers. All told, the outlook for oil prices remains consistent with our forecasts for steady global growth and low inflation. The FTSE 100 is still heading for a record closing high, although it is currently off the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best levels, but with a raft of UK economic data due this week, the question is whether the index can maintain its good run. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, sayd: The index hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite been able to climb back to the 7460 all-time intraday high it hit soon after the bell; however, it is still lurking around the 7450 mark, keeping it on track to close at a new record peak. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly thanks to its buoyant commodity sector; Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5% surge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Putin throwing his backing behind the continuation of an oil-output cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has obviously lifted the oil stocks, while the miners were pleased with the announcement of a $900 billion infrastructure spend in China. It is going to be interested to see if the FTSE can hold onto that growth tomorrow. The latest inflation figure is released on Tuesday morning and, with analysts expecting the reading to climb from 2.3% to 2.6% month-on-month, the pound could be in for a bit of a boost. Since Brexit that has tended to mean bad news for the UK index, though it is worth noting that cable has managed to keep its head above $1.29 without troubling the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-breaking rise. More positive news from the US housing market. The National Association of Homebuilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has climbed to 70 in April, compared to the 68 level reached in March and expected to be repeated last month. US markets are also benefiting from the rise in oil prices, with investors shrugging off the worldwide cyber attack which began on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 62 points or 0.3% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened more than 0.1% better, with the latter at a new record high. Back with Greece, and credit rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has kept its stable outlook on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, citing the improved prospects for profitability. But it warned that problem loans remained high and were a severe challenge for Greek banks, although they should start declining from around 45% of gross loans at the end of 2016 over the next 12 to 18 months. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added that it expected Greek banks to remain marginally profitable in 20179-2018, although the operating environment would remain challenging. Much depends on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get funding from its creditors in a timely manner, said the agency. Time for a recap... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is on track for a new record closing high, after hitting its highest ever level in early trading. Having romped up to 7460 points shortly after 8am, the FTSE 100 has dropped back a little. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently nine points higher at 7444, above last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close. The rally is being driven by mining companies, which dominate the leaderboard today. Investors are anticipating higher demand for commodities as China presses on with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Belt and Road\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategy to build new infrastructure and transport links in Asia and beyond. The oil price continues to climb too, after Russia and Saudi Arabia announced they both supported extending a current agreement to curb crude output. Brent crude is now up 3% today, at $52.41 per barrel, after Vladimir Putin said this would help to stabilise prices. Chris Beauchamp of IG says that bullish traders were in the driving seat this morning, but also warns that a correction could be coming.... A new record high for the FTSE 100 this morning was driven in no small part by oil firms, which have been boosted by further talk among oil ministers that more production cuts will be necessary. What should worry FTSE bulls is that the index is exhibiting similar characteristics to the S&amp;P 500 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely that the rally is being powered by smaller and smaller numbers of rising stocks each day; this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean a correction is around the corner, but it does raise the prospect of a reckoning that could be ugly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that only 40 members of the FTSE 100 have risen today, while 60 have fallen.... In Europe, optimism has been slightly dented by the news that Greece has been draged back into recession: And in the last few moments, Emmanuel Macron has named centre-right politician Eduard Philippe as his prime minister. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction from Guardian colleagues.... And other experts: Newsflash from America: The factory sector of New York state has weakened this month, adding to a recent run of disappointing US data. The Empire State manufacturing index has dropped to minus 1, from 5.2 in April, dashing hopes of a rise to 7.0. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first negative reading since last October, and therefore the weakest report since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Companies in and around New York reported a drop in new orders, and a decline in employment growth too. The US stock market is tipped to rise slightly when trading begins, in 80 minutes. Holiday firm TUI has bucked today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trend, by falling 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Traders dumped TUI stock after the company reported subdued demand for holidays to Turkey and North Africa. Instead, tourists are plumping for Spain and Canaries, Greece, Cyprus, Cape Verde and Caribbean, apparently. TUI insisted that summer trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in line with our expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with UK demand holding up despite the Brexit vote. But while revenues rose 4% in the last quarter, to nearly \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.1bn, pretax losses (on an EBITA basis) rose to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac182.4m, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac138.1m a year ago. TUI also warned that the fall in the pound is driving up its costs, even though it hedged itself against the worst of the damage: Sterling remaining at rates significantly lower than those seen prior to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Brexit referendum. In line with TUI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hedging policy, the UK Source Market had already hedged a significant proportion of its foreign currency requirements ahead of the Brexit referendum, however on the unhedged portion this results in higher costs which will impact the UK business in the second half of the year. JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of City workers needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pack their bags quite yet. But it does appear that the Wall Street bank is committed to moving jobs to Ireland, thanks to Brexit. JP Morgan announced this morning it has bought a new office block at Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Capital Dock development. The site will hold 1,000 workers, which is twice its current workforce in the Irish capital. The company has previously said it will move jobs out of London, if (as seems likely) the UK loses its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to within the EU. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Newsflash: Russian president Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Moscow is keen to extend the current deal to curb oil production by an extra nine months. Speaking in China, where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been learning about the Silk Road plan, Putin told reporter that a longer production freeze, to March 2018, would ensure stable prices. Putin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have met with the heads of the companies ... and we support the proposal. In a wide-ranging discussion, Putin also denied that Russia was behind the WannnaCry cybercrime attack, called for a return to dialogue with North Korea, and insisted that Russia was right to miss the Eurovision Song Contest. Ukraine, he claimed, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to the job of hosting it..... Via Fidelity, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has performed under every prime minister since Ted Heath: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that Margaret Thatcher delivered the biggest gains. Her sheer longevity (11 years) is one obvious factor. Stocks also rallied after the Big Bang of 1986 which revolutionised the City and shook up share trading. You might expect Tony Blair to be closer to Thatcher, given he governed for over a decade. However, the market fell sharply in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst, and took years to recover those losses. Jim Callaghan gave investors the best annualised returns, at over 23% per year from 1976-1979. But that was also a time of rollicking inflation.... Gordon Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure, from 2007-2010, was the worst time to own shares. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the financial crisis which brought down Northern Rock and HBOS, and forced Royal Bank of Scotland into a taxpayer rescue too. No wonder investors suffered. But we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blithely assume that the Tories have some magic touch for the stock market, as Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While on the face of it the Conservatives appear to have delivered more impressive stock market returns than Labour in recent years, the economic and market environment has a far more important bearing on the performance of the stock market than who the current occupant of Number 10 is. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For example, while UK stocks rose by over 500 per cent under Margaret Thatcher (which some have credited to her decision to deregulate the financial markets), stocks across the globe enjoyed similar returns. Similarly, while the markets produced a negative return under Gordon Brown, this was a reflection of the financial crisis rather than Labour party policy. The oil price is continuing to climb, helping to keep the FTSE 100 at record highs. The prospect of Opec extending its production curbs, combined with optimism over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Silk Road plans, have pushed Brent crude up by 2.5% to $52.10 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for BP, whose shares are now up 1.3%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potentially bad news for companies and individuals, as it implies that petrol prices on the forecourt will go up. This would intensify the looming wage squeeze in the UK, with inflation already expected to rise faster than earnings this year... Bad news from Greece... the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has suffered another contraction. Greek GDP shrank by 0.1% in the first three months of this year, following a 1.2% plunge in October-December. That puts Greece back into recession, in a reminder of its fragile economic state after years of austerity and political upheaval. Later this week, MPs will vote on further spending cuts and tax reforms in return for another tranche of loans. Chinese president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious infrastructure plans are driving shares higher around the globe, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. As mentioned earlier, China has been proudly outlining its plans for new land and sea connections with the rest of the world. It aims to spend hundreds of billions of dollars improving ports, roads and rail links in Europe and Africa, to spruce up old trade routes and create new ones. Brooks says: The big news over the weekend was a Chinese government summit that announced the new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silk Road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd project, which aims to forge peace, inclusiveness and free trade across the world. China has pledged $124bn in infrastructure spending to bring this into action, and markets are cheering Chinese largesse, with Brent crude rising $1 on the back of this news at the start of the week. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending pledge has underpinned risk sentiment more generally this morning, with European equities opening higher and US futures pointing to a stronger open on Wall Street. More details here: The FTSE 100 is being boosted by Saudi Arabia and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to extending their current deal on oil output curbs, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: The FTSE is (oil) barrelling towards a fresh all-time high this Monday, ignoring both the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWannaCry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ransomware attack of last Friday, and a selection of weak Chinese data that saw industrial production drop from 7.6% to 6.5% month-on-month. Rising 25 points to lurk just above 7450, the UK index is already at a new peak \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now it just needs to stay there. The main thrust of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the commodity sector, itself led by Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The black stuff surged 2% after the bell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now sits just under $52 per barrel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having been lifted by reports that both Saudi Arabia and Russia are willing to support an extension of the current output-capping agreement. Traders have been rushing to buy shares in cybersecurity companies following the WannaCry ransomware outbreak that struck Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NHS on Friday, and companies and users across the globe. Shares in Sophos, which sells antivirus, encryption and network security products, have jumped 7% to an all-time high. Other security firms are also in demand, as Reuters reports: Cybersecurity stocks and tracker products rose at the European open on Monday after a global \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ransomware\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attack disrupted car factories, hospitals, shops and schools around the world. A London-listed cybersecurity exchange-traded fund ISE whose holdings include software provider Cisco Systems and cybersecurity firms Fireeye and Symantec rose 0.9 percent at the open. Our liveblog is tracking the latest developments: Update: The FTSE 100 has nudged a new all-time intraday high of 7460 points. That puts the index of top UK -listed companies firmly on track for a new closing high at 4.30pm as well. Smaller companies are also in demand this morning; The FTSE small cap index has also hit an all-time high this morning. Anyone who bought British shares the day after the EU referendum is sitting on a very large profit. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means the FTSE 100 has now gained 20% since the close of play on June 24th, when closed at 6138 points. Anyone who had the nerve to buy shares then, after a day of wild losses, has done pretty well. This chart from the FT shows how the Footsie rapidly shook off its initial panic over the Brexit vote, and has risen steadily since. However... the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise is partly due to the slump in sterling after the referendum. This has pumped up the value of money earned abroad by multinationals listed in London, and also made UK companies more attractive to foreign predators. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also on a tear this morning, hitting its own all-time high. The DAX index of top German companies has gained almost 0.5% this morning, extending its recent rally. German shares have been in demand in recent weeks, as fears of a populist surge in Europe have faded. The amount of money flowing into European equities hit a record high last week, on relief that Emmanuel Macron had won the French presidency. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious economic plans appear to be driving the London stock market to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Over the weekend, Chinese president Xi Jinping launched a summit to promote the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBelt and Road\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- a $900bn infrastructure mega-project. Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision is a global construction spree covering 65 countries, from Asia to the Americas via Africa and Europe. And that is likely to drive up consumption of iron ore, copper, nickel -- which is why mining stocks are in demand this morning. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Metals prices are advancing, helped by optimism about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one Belt, one Road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd program. Boom! The FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time record high at the start of trading in London. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index has gained 23 points to 7458, as energy producers and natural resource stocks rally. The rally pushes the FTSE 100 over its previous all-time intraday high of 7447, which it hit on the 17th March this year. Mining giants like Glencore, BHP Billiton, and Antofagasta are all dominating the risers. Royal Dutch Shell is also in demand, following the rise in the oil price. Reaction to follow! This chart from Bloomberg shows how the oil price jumped this morning, following the Saudi-Russia announcement: The oil price has jumped this morning, after Saudi Arabia and Russia signalled their support for a new deal to cut production levels. Brent crude - oil sourced from the North Sea - has jumped by 1.5% to $51.62 per barrel. US crude oil is also gaining. The move came after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Russian energy minister Alexander Novak announced that they believe a current deal to cut crude supplies should be extended until the end of March 2018. In a statement, they said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to conclusion that the agreement needs to be extended. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The two ministers agreed to do whatever it takes to achieve the desired goal of stabilizing the market and reducing commercial oil inventories to their 5-year average level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This raises the chances that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current supply cut deal, which runs out in June, should be extended. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After hitting a record closing high on Friday, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 may hit a new all-time peak when trading begins today. Markets in Asia have already rallied, as traders shake off the shock of the WannaCry malware attack and a smaller-than-expected rise in US retail sales on Friday. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has hit its highest level since June 2015, up 0.3%. Emerging markets have also posted gains. Reuters reports that: Resilient Asian stocks edged up to a two-year high on Monday, shaking off threats from by a ransomware attack that locked some 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries at the weekend, a missile test by North Korea, and weak U.S. data. European financial markets are expected to open higher, helped by optimism over Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Speculation that oil producers might extend their supply curbs could also push the market higher. So the FTSE 100, which close at 7435 on Friday night, could make a run at the all-time intraday high of 7447 set in March. The news that Angela Merkel has won a key state election overnight could also please investors. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU party beat the Social Democrats in North Rhine-Westphalia by a comfortable margin, suggesting she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on track to win another term as German chancellor this autumn. CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson says: The German Chancellor who only decided to run again for a historic fourth term quite late on in the German elections later this year will be feeling quite happy having seen off her rivals at the SPD, and the challenge of their new leader Martin Schulz in state elections at the weekend, in North Rhine-Westphalia. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic diary, apart from Greek GDP for the first quarter of 2017 at 10am BST. In the City, holiday firm TUI is reporting its half-year results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the news through the day...",

While changes to IR since the early 1990s have arguably led to improved productivity growth, that same IR system has not led to a similar improvements in workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 income. As in other nations, our more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd IR system has seen a break between the previously linked productivity growth and worker income: The gap between productivity growth and worker compensation since 1995 is actually worse in Australia than in the USA: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty damning indictment of our IR system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our workers are getting less reward for productivity benefits than the USA. And the OECD also notes a major issue of work that is occurring in Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153higher employment rates but lower average hours per worker, which points to more part-time working, often in low productivity jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In April, while the unemployment rate stayed steady at 5.8% and total employment rose, the hours worked fell. Over the past two years, the growth of hours worked has lagged well behind employment, and after a small pickup, it now looks to have plateaued again: It means that the hours worked per capita (ie the average hours worked by all people aged over 15) fell to its lowest level since 1994. In April, the per capita weekly hours worked was just 21: This fall is just part of a long running disjoint since the global financial crisis between hours worked and the percentage of adults who are employed: The current IR system in place since the early 1990s has certainly led to more people in the workforce, but it has also seen a big shift towards part-time work. In 1994, when the average hours worked by all adults was at the level it is now, the unemployment rate was 10.1% and just 56.4% of adults were employed compared to 61% now. It means to get the same hours worked per capita as in 1994, we now have the equivalent of 908,000 more people employed. That is good for those who want to only work part-time, but as has been noted previously, it is also a reason why underemployment is now so high. And that goes to the issue of our IR system. It is no surprise that we have more part-time workers and more underemployed workers now than in the past. The framework of the current system that has been amended and adjusted since the early 1990s explicitly leads to such a situation. The flexibility that allows situations where employers are able to reduce hours rather than dismiss workers is a benefit during downturns, but has also led to employers preferring part-time work more than in the past \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even during good times. It has meant Australia has produced comparatively good productivity growth since the GFC, but as we have seen, workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wages have continually grown by less during that period, and real wages have now been flat for over four years. The report by the OECD also shows that Australian workers have received less benefit from their productivity growth than almost any workers in advanced economies: Such a situation might be enough to shake up the IR debate. Workers may be less willing than in the past to swallow the line that greater flexibility will lead to greater productivity and then better pay.",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market became more subdued as Tuesday went on, with little to engender any significant movement. </p> <p>As it was earlier in the day, the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main data-focus was on the latest set of PMIs, this time from the US. They ended up cancelling each other out, however; the manufacturing reading unexpectedly dropped from 53.2 to 52.5 month-on-month, but with the services figure jumping to a higher than forecast 54.0. This did little for the Dow Jones, which started the session up 10 or so points, roughly a quarter of what was promised by the futures.</p> <p>The Eurozone lost some of its lustre after lunch, the DAX and CAC seeing their growth shrink back to 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Even the previously dominant euro slowed down; the currency now sits flat against the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having been up as much as 0.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and actually down 0.1% against the dollar.</p> <p>As for the UK, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds were understandably elsewhere. The FTSE nudged 0.1% higher, maintaining a 7500-plus performance, while the pound fared a bit worse, clawing back its losses against the euro but dipping 0.2% against the greenback.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-592442f9e4b0366955f557a6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-23T14:18:12.324Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US new home sales disappoint</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still with the US, and a poor set of housing figures, albeit after a strong performance in the previous month.</p> <p>New single family home sales dropped 11.4% in April to a seasonally adjusted rate of 569,000 units, down from a nine and a half year high in March.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth of US business activity gained a little momentum for a second successive month in May, but the upturn still looks somewhat underwhelming. </p> <p>Historical comparisons of the PMI against GDP indicates that the PMI is running at a level broadly consistent with the economy growing at a 0.4% quarterly rate (1.5% annualized).

The survey is indicative of non-farm payroll growth of approximately 160,000. </p> <p>Average prices charged for goods and services meanwhile showed one of the largest rises in the past two years.

So business was rather subdued throughout the day, with the FTSE 100 managing to stay in positive territory for most of the day, only to slip back after a late bounce in the pound. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 edged to a new closing high, while European markets also ended higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 11.05 points or 0.15% at 7485.29 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.31% to 12,659.15 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.47% at 5348.16 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 0.46% to 21,415.74 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.14% at 10,916.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.7% to 783.03 following the overnight failure of the country to win a debt deal with creditors On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently Here are some new figures from the ONS showing a regional breakdown of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. Larry Elliott writes: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thriving economy generates a \u00c2\u00a326.5bn surplus that is recycled by the government to provide financial help to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less well-off regions, according to an official breakdown of the public finances. The first attempt by the Office for National Statistics to break down the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit by region has demonstrated the importance of the capital and highlighted how taxes and public spending are used to narrow the north-south divide. Experimental data from the ONS showed that only three regions of the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c London, the south-east and the east of England \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ran a budget surplus in the 2015-16 financial year, the latest year for which figures are available. The full story is here: The markets are looking a little lacklustre at the moment. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The market became more subdued as Tuesday went on, with little to engender any significant movement. As it was earlier in the day, the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main data-focus was on the latest set of PMIs, this time from the US. They ended up cancelling each other out, however; the manufacturing reading unexpectedly dropped from 53.2 to 52.5 month-on-month, but with the services figure jumping to a higher than forecast 54.0. This did little for the Dow Jones, which started the session up 10 or so points, roughly a quarter of what was promised by the futures. The Eurozone lost some of its lustre after lunch, the DAX and CAC seeing their growth shrink back to 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. Even the previously dominant euro slowed down; the currency now sits flat against the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having been up as much as 0.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and actually down 0.1% against the dollar. As for the UK, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds were understandably elsewhere. The FTSE nudged 0.1% higher, maintaining a 7500-plus performance, while the pound fared a bit worse, clawing back its losses against the euro but dipping 0.2% against the greenback. Still with the US, and a poor set of housing figures, albeit after a strong performance in the previous month. New single family home sales dropped 11.4% in April to a seasonally adjusted rate of 569,000 units, down from a nine and a half year high in March. Analysts had been expecting a much smaller decline of 1.5%. And away again from the levity, and some data from the US showing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to head in the right direction, helped by the service sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial composite purchasing manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index climbed from 53.2 in April to 53.9 in May. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion). Within that, manufacturing fell from 52.8 in April to 52.5 in May, below expectations of a figure of 53. But the services PMI rose from 53.1 to 54 in May, above forecasts of a flat reading at 53.1. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Growth of US business activity gained a little momentum for a second successive month in May, but the upturn still looks somewhat underwhelming. Historical comparisons of the PMI against GDP indicates that the PMI is running at a level broadly consistent with the economy growing at a 0.4% quarterly rate (1.5% annualized). Actual second quarter GDP numbers are likely to be considerably stronger, in part reflecting seasonality in the official data and the weak first quarter. May saw an encouraging upturn in service sector growth to the fastest so far this year, buoyed by rising domestic demand. Manufacturers, on the other hand, reported the smallest rise in production since last September amid lacklustre export sales. There were mixed signals for the outlook. Optimism about the year ahead fell slightly, but hiring remained reassuringly solid, thanks to a step- up in service sector recruitment. The survey is indicative of non-farm payroll growth of approximately 160,000. Average prices charged for goods and services meanwhile showed one of the largest rises in the past two years. The strengthening of business activity growth and rise in prices will add to expectations of the Fed hiking interest rates again in June. It really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good day for levity, but Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has fallen for an email prankster. The governor was deceived by a hoaxer pretending to be Anthony Habgood, chair of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court. In the exchange, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Habgood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd starts by tweeting about claims that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a310 note has an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153airbrushed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd picture of Jane Austen, before inviting the governor to a drinks party. Carney appears to be initially taken in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joking about former deputy governor Eddie George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appetite for drink. But he then slaps \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Habgood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down, after the conversation took a sleazy turn with talk of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dashing bar ladies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Does it matter? Yes, as it shows that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email security isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tight enough. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not terribly forgivable, as Barclays CEO Jes Staley fell to the same hoaxster last week. Following in the steps of Europe, US markets have moved higher in early trading, ahead of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first full budget plan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 29 points or 0.14%, while both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened around 0.2% higher. Over in Athens the government spokesman has challenged the German finance minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, and suggested Berlin is responsible for the failure to reach a comprehensive deal that would also include debt relief. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Without singling out Germany by name, Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some cannot say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to reforms...but no to the restructuring of the debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The solution presented yesterday corresponded neither to the targets that had recently been set nor the sacrifices of the Greek people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reference to the extra creditor-mandated pension cuts and tax hikes the Greek government pushed through parliament last week. Tzanakopoulos repeated that both the IMF and Berlin remained locked in disagreement over growth projections - regarded as vital to calculating debt relief - and its ability to achieve a high 3.5 % primary budget surplus in the years ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main difference between the IMF and the German finance ministry has to do with the growth projections and primary surpluses after 2023.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has just told reporters in Brussels that the IMF \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproved to be difficult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 during last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Speaking after a meeting with EU finance ministers, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble insisted that Germany wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blocking a deal to release fresh aid to Greece, and just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsticking to the rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If everything goes well, he added, a deal could be reached in three weeks (at the next Eurogroup meeting). Via Reuters. Guardian Business is launching a daily email.

To receive the email every morning at 8am, sign up here: Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakolotos has tried to put a positive spin on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abortive attempt to find a solution to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemingly unstoppable debt saga. In statements released by the finance ministry he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quite confident that if all sides are in a mood of compromise, it should not be beyond the wit of man to find that compromise within three weeks. It does mean that all sides will need to compromise a bit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos said progress had been made on the policy package Greece must adopt and on the fiscal front, with creditors agreeing that Athens should achieve a primary fiscal surplus of 3.5% for four years once the current bailout ends in late 2018. But the main opposition party, the centre right New Democracy, slammed prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his lelftist-led government saying both were subjecting Greeks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairytales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ND spokesman Vasillis Kikillas told Skai channel: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many fairytales will Greeks be subjected to? Six Eurogroups have elapsed and Mr Tsipras keeps telling us that the second review and agreement has been concluded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of getting the loan disbursement and closing the deal, he has got nothing and burdened Greeks with measures worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14bn. Neither has the review closed, neither has he got the loan disbursement and of course there is not a word about the debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Athens stock market has fallen amid disappointment that the eurogroup didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unlock Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next bailout payment last night. The benchmark ATG index is down 1% at 780 points, with bank shares leading the selloff. Shares had rallied recently, hitting an 21-month high this month, on hopes that Greece would receive vital bailout loans. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious anxiety that ministers are returning home from Brussels empty handed, with the bailout review still incomplete. Greek bonds are also suffering, with yields (interest rates) jumping as investors sell the debt, pushing down prices. Other European stock markets are having a better morning, with gains in France and Germany following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong PMI reports. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rather subdued day in the City, though, with workers preoccupied by the awful attack in Manchester. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2963, which helped to nudge the FTSE 100 a bit higher. But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart is really in it today. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services sums up the mood on the trading floors. Another barbaric terrorist attack UK will cast a very long shadow over the UK general election (for which campaigning has been understandably suspended), the public and financial markets, and renders all else rather moot. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers became more anxious about trading conditions this month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report on the sector, which found that sentiment fell at the fastest rate since 2012. John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finances paint a mixed picture: On the positive side, the estimate budget deficit for 2016/17 as a whole was revised down by more than \u00c2\u00a33 billion due to higher tax receipts and lower spending than initially estimated last month. The deficit last year was only around 2.5% of GDP, similar to pre-crisis levels and moving closer to levels that would be sustainable in the long run. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the other hand, public borrowing in April 2017 was \u00c2\u00a310.4 billion, around \u00c2\u00a31.2 billion higher than the same month last year. We should not read too much into a preliminary estimate for a single month, but it is consistent with the broader picture painted by the OBR in March when they predicted that the budget deficit could widen again this financial year as some favourable timing effects on both tax and spending in 2016/17 were reversed in 2017/18. Hawksworth adds: Whoever forms the next government will still need to make some tough choices on tax and spending in the longer term, as the recent debate on social care shows.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance report also shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt has swelled since the financial crisis struck, both in cash terms (in blue) and as a share of national output (the red line) Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics has tweeted an interesting chart from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finances. It shows how growth in UK tax receipts has slowed in the last couple of months (one reason the deficit went up in April). The jump in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit last month highlights the challenge facing the next government. So warns Ross Campbell, public sector director at ICAEW (which represents chartered accountants), who calls April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precariously high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Campbell adds: The amount of interest Government pays because of its growing debt, projected to be \u00c2\u00a346 billion annually in 2017/2018, is \u00c2\u00a37 billion more than in the previous financial year. Instead of loading up the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit card with no comprehensive strategy to pay off these financial obligations, this money could be used to tackle key issues across all party manifestos, such as social care, education, and intelligent infrastructure plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd PUBLIC FINANCES: Britain borrowed more than expected to balance the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books last month. The UK budget deficit jumped to \u00c2\u00a310.4bn in April, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show, some \u00c2\u00a31.2bn more than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the most pessimistic City forecasts (the consensus was for a deficit of around \u00c2\u00a38.9bn). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unimpressive start to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017-18 financial year. VAT receipts stalled in April, compared with a year ago, while stamp duty income fell. But Britain brought in more money through income tax (up 1%), corporation tax (up 7%) and fuel duty. In better news, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit in the previous financial year (2016-2017) has been revised down by \u00c2\u00a33.3bn, to \u00c2\u00a348.7bn. But this still leaves Britain with a national debt of \u00c2\u00a31.7224 trillion, of 82.6% of GDP. Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, says this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong PMI report shows that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to impress. Momentum for the single currency has been obvious with the euro peaking at 8-month highs against the US dollar at a time where political threats are quickly diminishing. Populist voting has been quashed in both the Netherlands and France, with the main conundrum for [ECB president] Mario Draghi, low inflation, seemingly also disappearing as levels are very close to the 2% target. At a time where Trump is continually sending shockwaves across US markets, and the UK in the midst of an election, things in the eurozone appear somewhat settled. Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan, believes the European Central Bank will resist pressure to start tightening monetary policy. The Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth trajectory remains very supportive, fuelling expectations that the European Central Bank will have to adjust its stance soon, maybe as early as June. However, despite some green shoots, inflation dynamics remain relatively subdued and the recent appreciation of the Euro was cited by some survey respondents as a drag on new business. A tightening of monetary policy would only reinforce that trend and as such, the ECB may have to wait before signalling that the end of its extremely accommodative policy is in sight. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to rattle along at its fastest rate since the debt crisis began. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone PMI, which tracks company growth across the eurozone, has just come in at 56.8 in May, matching April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, which was a six-year high. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this report suggests that the European economy is enjoying its sunniest patch since 2011. Markit reports that manufacturing firms led the way, while overall business optimism has hit a joint five-year high. And job creation is now running close to a 10-year high, boosting hopes that Europe is finally fixing its unemployment crisis. This is only a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reading, so we only have details for Germany (here) and France (here)-- which both posted the best readings since 2011, of course. Markit reports that growth eased across the rest of the single currency area but remained close to a ten-year high. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI data suggests eurozone growth is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpressively strong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Business activity is expanding at its fastest rate for six years so far in the second quarter, consistent with 0.6- 0.7% GDP growth. The consensus forecast of 0.4% second quarter growth could well prove overly pessimistic if the PMI holds its elevated level in June. Capacity is being strained by the strength of demand, with backlogs of work showing one of the largest increases in the past six years. Job creation has surged to the second-highest rate in nearly a decade as firms seek to expand capacity and meet rising demand. The German PMI figures have also impressed economists. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski.... ...Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets... ...and Pepijn Bergsen of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is also powering ahead, in another encouraging sign for the eurozone. The German manufacturing PMI has jumped to 59.4 this month, up from 58.2 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seriously solid number -- the highest in 73 months -- indicating that the sector grew at a faster rate. Service sector growth dipped a little (the PMI slipped to 55.2 from 55.4), but the overall composite PMI jumped to its highest since 2011. German companies reported that output and new business rose this month, with goods producers seeing the biggest rise in new export orders in seven years. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The flash PMI data for May signalled no let-up in German economic growth, with the headline output index reaching its highest level in over six years. The index has trended at 57.0 over April-May, pointing to the strongest quarterly expansion since Q2 2011. Manufacturing continued its impressive performance with output, new orders and backlogs all growing at the sharpest rates in over six years, and export expansion hitting a seven-year record. Cost pressures at manufacturers also eased noticeably in May, but remained strong overall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only blot on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s copybook in May was a further solid but unspectacular rise in service sector new business, reflected in another decline in the volume of outstanding work in the sector. Economists are impressed by France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong private sector growth this month. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maxime Sbaihi says it shows the economy strengthened this quarter (after growing by only 0.3% in Q1). This is from Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: We have encouraging news from France this morning. French companies are growing at their fastest pace in six years right now, according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has jumped to 58.0, from 56.7 in April. That shows that growth accelerated during the month. Companies took on more staff this month, at the fastest rate in 69 months, to help tackle a steady increase in new business. Factory growth dipped slightly, but the overall \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 still rose to its highest level since the eurozone debt crisis began in 2011. It suggests that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is continuing; a welcome boost to Emmanuel Macron as he gets to grips with the presidency. Alex Gill, Economist at IHS Markit says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong growth momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the French private sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The acceleration was driven by the dominant service sector, buoyed by strong client demand and the sharpest round of job creation since August 2011. Meanwhile, the rate of output growth in the manufacturing sector remained marked but eased from April amid a weaker rise in new business, linked, in part, to a strengthened euro. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The numbers continue to paint a positive picture of the French private sector economy. Furthermore, with May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion to the presidential elections, the road looks set fair for future growth. However, eyes will now turn to June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative elections as a next potential stumbling block.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks failed partly because the eurogroup and the IMF can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree how large a budget surplus Greece should run. From Brussels, my colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: At the heart of the dispute is a demand that Greece run a budget surplus equivalent to 3.5% of GDP. The European side thinks Greece can hit this target in 2018, but the IMF has long argued that any country with high unemployment, (currently 23% in Greece) would struggle to meet such demanding fiscal targets. In a sign of a possible concession from both sides, Dijsselbloem said there had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full agreement that the 3.5% primary surplus should remain for five years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and eventually fall, although he did not specify a figure. Speaking about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability, Dijsselbloem said there was a gap in expectations between the eurozone and the IMF. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to close that [gap] by looking at additional options or adjusting our expectations. Both are possible and both should be done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her report: Greek bonds are weakening in early trading as the City react to the lack of progress at yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting. The yield, or interest rate, on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark 10-year bonds has jumped to 5.73%, up from 5.6% last night. That means traders are demanding an extra premium to hold the debt. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly modest move -- and still below the 7% \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdanger zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that shows a country is in peril. Also, as Greece is still in a bailout, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually need to borrow from the markets at these rates today. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running debt drama is heating up again after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors failed to reach a deal to unlock the next instalment of its bailout loans. Despite talking until almost midnight in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on debt relief measures for Athens. The deadlock means Greece still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received the fresh loans it needs before July, when it faces large loan repayments. Instead, the can has been kicked a little way down the road to June 15th, when the eurogroup meets again. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that, while Greece had made \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, it still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken enough actions to qualify for its next aid tranche. Striking an optimistic note, Dijsselbloem declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure we can be successful if we take a little more time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there is concern that the International Monetary Fund still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed to support the bailout -- which was originally agreed in summer 2015. Also coming up today 8am to 9am BST: Data firm Markit are releasing their latest PMI surveys, showing how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and service sector companies are faring this morning. 9.30am: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances for April are published, showing how much Britain borrowed last month. Economists expect a deficit of between \u00c2\u00a37bn and \u00c2\u00a310bn RBC Capital Markets say: It will be difficult to make inferences about the state of the public finances from the first month of data in the new fiscal year. In the context of a full year target for the deficit of \u00c2\u00a358.3bn in 2017-18, we would expect the April borrowing requirement to have been around \u00c2\u00a310bn. The general election is scheduled for 8 June, so this of course presents scope for subsequent changes to existing plans, even if they are modest ones in the event of a Conservative victory, as we explored in a recent publication. In any case, it will be more appropriate to make a more thorough assessment of the fiscal situation once the election is out of the way and we know the extent of any changes in economic strategy. 11am: The CBI releases its UK retail sales report for May",

                "bodyText":"China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating has been downgraded by Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the first time in almost 30 years over fears that slowing growth and rising debts will weaken the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. The agency lowered China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3, putting it in the same category as countries such as Japan and Israel. The outlook was raised to stable from negative. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said the downgrade reflected its expectations that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The last time Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating was 1989, the same year as the Tiananmen Square protests. The new move frustrated Beijing, where the finance ministry accused Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of overestimating the risks facing the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-financial debt will rise rapidly and the government would continue to maintain growth via stimulus measures are exaggerating difficulties facing the Chinese economy, and underestimating the Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to deepen supply-side structural reform and appropriately expand aggregate demand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ministry said in a statement. The downgrade is likely to increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if only modestly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the cost of borrowing for Beijing and Chinese state-owned organisations, and it remains within the investment grade rating range. The negative view initially weighed on Asian markets, commodities and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency on Wednesday. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned economic reforms would not avert a significant rise in debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Government stimulus has been a key driver of growth in recent years, but it has also led to a sharp rise in credit and debt levels. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects growth to slow to about 5% over the next five years. Last year the Chinese economy grew by 6.7% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the weakest since 1990. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also cut the rating of 26 state-owned enterprises by one notch, shortly after the main sovereign downgrade. The list included China National Petroleum Corporation, China Three Gorges Corporation, Guangzhou Metro Group, and Dongfeng Motor Corporation. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry insisted the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP would continue to grow at medium to high levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and that will provide fundamental support to fend off local government debt risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ministry added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government debt risks will not change dramatically in the period of 2018-20 from 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects government debt to rise to 40% of GDP by the end of 2018, and to 45% by 2020. Luc Froehlich, head of investment directing for Asian fixed income at Fidelity International, said China was facing a number of issues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The downgrade is yet another sign of the challenges faced by China, which is juggling rising leverage, declining economic growth rates and ongoing structural reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite these mounting pressures, we are confident that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank and its regulators are firmly in control of the situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics, said activity in the country was likely to slow further in the forthcoming quarters as officials continue their efforts to rein in credit risks.

The forecasting group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Christen and Mark Williams said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was no particular trigger for the move, other than ongoing concerns about the lack of reform momentum in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets...</p> <p>Ultimately, as is often the case with such downgrades, the announcement contained little, if any, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggles to bring down leverage, while maintaining rapid economic growth are well-documented, and Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had lowered its outlook for China in March 2016.</p> <p>Bond prices barely moved. Most are purchased overwhelmingly by domestic, state-owned banks, and held to maturity. There was therefore little chance of a spike in yields. And in any case, an A1 rating still puts China well within \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investment grade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status.</p> <p>Admittedly, excessive credit growth raises the risks of a government bailout out of the financial sector in the event of a severe downturn, which could plausibly add around 35%-pts to the debt ratio. But with only a tiny fraction of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt denominated in dollars, there is little chance of an outright default: the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBOC) can theoretically inflate away the debt. Moreover, while we expect a slowdown in GDP growth, we do not expect a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard-landing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Equity markets dropped initially \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Shanghai Composite fell by about 1% on the news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but had recouped their losses by the end of trading. We have long argued that Chinese equities might face a downward correction once the economy starts to slow, and as the crackdown on leverage begins to bite. But there is little chance of a slump, as P/E ratios are nowhere near the levels reached just during the bubble in the first half of 2015 and not particularly high relative to levels seen at other times in the past.</p> <p>Finally, there appears to have been little pressure on the renminbi. While it might weaken a little this year, we then see it rising again to \u00c2\u00a56.8/$ in 2018, and \u00c2\u00a56.5/$ in 2019, as the dollar starts to come under pressure against the other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd currencies, and as the authorities in China permit some appreciation of their currency in trade-weighted terms.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconMarkets/status/867399394194333696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chinese markets barely reacted to Moody&#39;s downgrade.

In this regard, the [monitoring committee] should continue monitoring conformity levels as well as market conditions and immediate prospects, and recommend further adjustment actions, if deemed necessary. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-24T14:08:29.235Z\">at 3.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59258ff7e4b00411834011b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-24T13:53:36.945Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from the European Central Bank, and governing council member and head of the Bank of Slovenia Bostjan Jazbec:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/867376498164060162\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jazbec: Too Early To Conclude That Inflation Has Been Revived, ECB Should Maintain Stimulus For Now</p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/867376498164060162\">May 24, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59258c14e4b03e3ca245f370\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-24T13:43:16.664Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street edges higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have opened marginally higher, helped by a positive start for technology stocks.</p> <p>Ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 6 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite opened around 0.1% and 0.2% higher respectively.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-592585f8e4b0e76a8f20659e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-24T13:14:06.848Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Anglo Irish's Sean Fitzpatrick acquitted as trial collapses</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ad2e05865d46c83505a5b3d9d04ffa95372caac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad2e05865d46c83505a5b3d9d04ffa95372caac/0_0_3500_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean Fitzpatrick leaving the Dublin Criminal Court today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean Fitzpatrick leaving the Dublin Criminal Court today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>He was one of the masters of the Irish financial universe whose bank almost bankrupted Ireland.</strong><br></p> <p>But on Wednesday the former chairman of the Anglo Irish Bank Sean Fitzpatrick walked free from a Dublin court after being acquitted of misleading the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditors about multi-million euro loans.<br></p> <p>After the longest trial in Irish criminal history Fitzpatrick stood on the steps of the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Criminal Courts of Justice to declare:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb26f4d98480d19987a6ebe00b2021cb75f1987\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb26f4d98480d19987a6ebe00b2021cb75f1987/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean Fitzpatrick leaves the Dublin Criminal Court after a judge told him he is a free man after directing a jury to find him not guilty of fraud.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Twenty four hours earlier Mr Justice John Aylmer had told jurors he was going to direct them to acquit Fitzpatrick.

                "bodyText":"UK shares managed to end the day in positive territory, as investors shrugged off Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. The FTSE 100 edged higher while the FTSE 250 recorded yet another closing high. But with the euro holding steady, European markets were more subdued, dipping lower by the close. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.61 points or 0.4% higher at 7514.90 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.13% to 12,642.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.13% at 5341.34 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.21% to 21,369.73 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.08% lower at 10.907.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.17% to 766.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points or 0.13%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, and Capital Economics says it is not surprised the market reaction has been limited. The forecasting group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Christen and Mark Williams said: There was no particular trigger for the move, other than ongoing concerns about the lack of reform momentum in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets... Ultimately, as is often the case with such downgrades, the announcement contained little, if any, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggles to bring down leverage, while maintaining rapid economic growth are well-documented, and Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had lowered its outlook for China in March 2016. Bond prices barely moved. Most are purchased overwhelmingly by domestic, state-owned banks, and held to maturity. There was therefore little chance of a spike in yields. And in any case, an A1 rating still puts China well within \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investment grade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status. Admittedly, excessive credit growth raises the risks of a government bailout out of the financial sector in the event of a severe downturn, which could plausibly add around 35%-pts to the debt ratio. But with only a tiny fraction of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt denominated in dollars, there is little chance of an outright default: the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBOC) can theoretically inflate away the debt. Moreover, while we expect a slowdown in GDP growth, we do not expect a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard-landing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Equity markets dropped initially \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Shanghai Composite fell by about 1% on the news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but had recouped their losses by the end of trading. We have long argued that Chinese equities might face a downward correction once the economy starts to slow, and as the crackdown on leverage begins to bite. But there is little chance of a slump, as P/E ratios are nowhere near the levels reached just during the bubble in the first half of 2015 and not particularly high relative to levels seen at other times in the past. Finally, there appears to have been little pressure on the renminbi. While it might weaken a little this year, we then see it rising again to \u00c2\u00a56.8/$ in 2018, and \u00c2\u00a56.5/$ in 2019, as the dollar starts to come under pressure against the other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd currencies, and as the authorities in China permit some appreciation of their currency in trade-weighted terms. The jump in the oil price has not lasted long. With the key Opec meeting on Thursday, some caution has returned to the market after the positive price move after the bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks. Brent is now down 0.15% at $54.07 a barrel. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: US crude stockpiles dropped by an impressive 4.4 million barrels last week, according to data released this afternoon. While the news did cause a spike in the price of crude, traders then remembered that the Opec meeting is tomorrow and reversed course. Now we all wait for Opec, although tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schedule suggests that we have a whole day ahead of us before Opec announces its decision to the world. On the stock market he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOff the lows\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is about the best that can be said of a very dull session in London... For the time being, we are still stuck with a market that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go down, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go up, either. Ahead of the Opec meeting on Thursday, which could well see production cuts extended for nine months, comes data showing a bigger than forecast decline in US crude stocks. They fell by 4.43m barrels last week to 516.34m, compared to expectations of a 2.4m barrel drop. Byt gasoline stocks fell by a smaller than expected 787,000 barrels. The news has pushed oil prices higher, with Brent crude now up 0.7% at $54.53 a barrel. Before the US figures, it was sitting at $54.33, up 0.33%. The earlier speech by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has given some support to the euro. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: There was little in Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to indicate when the European Central Bank might start to reduce its policies of quantitative easing and low interest rates, but there was enough to boost investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances can remain stable. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that it will be business as usual for the ECB has seen the euro strengthen initially, with the financial stimulus provided by the bank looking set to continue for the foreseeable future. However, Draghi should be wary that the low inflationary pressure, caused by muted wage growth across the continent, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stamp out the green shoots of recovery that he has helped to sow. Over to the US, and some disappointing housing figures. Existing home sales fell by a higher than expected 2.3% in April, due to a shortage of houses on the market. They fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, compared to expectations of a 1.1% decline. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said: Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip in closings was somewhat expected given that there was such a strong sales increase in March at 4.2 percent, and new and existing inventory is not keeping up with the fast pace homes are coming off the marke. Demand is easily outstripping supply in most of the country and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stymieing many prospective buyers from finding a home to purchase. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting in Vienna - where there are hopes of an agreement to extend the production restrictions agreed in November - comes a recommendation from Opec and non-Opec monitoring committee. The committee said it believed the cutbacks should be extended by nine months: The [monitoring committee] took note of the current market conditions, including the level of global inventories, and concluded that it is necessary to extend the production adjustments. The Committee also took note of the fact that the duration of the anticipated extension should be longer than the originally stated period in the Declaration of Cooperation of six months. The [monitoring committee] then considered several scenarios presented by the [technical committee] regarding the extension of the Declaration of Cooperation and decided to recommend that the production adjustments of the participating countries be extended for nine months commencing 1 July 2017. In this regard, the [monitoring committee] should continue monitoring conformity levels as well as market conditions and immediate prospects, and recommend further adjustment actions, if deemed necessary. More from the European Central Bank, and governing council member and head of the Bank of Slovenia Bostjan Jazbec: US markets have opened marginally higher, helped by a positive start for technology stocks. Ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 6 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite opened around 0.1% and 0.2% higher respectively. He was one of the masters of the Irish financial universe whose bank almost bankrupted Ireland. But on Wednesday the former chairman of the Anglo Irish Bank Sean Fitzpatrick walked free from a Dublin court after being acquitted of misleading the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditors about multi-million euro loans. After the longest trial in Irish criminal history Fitzpatrick stood on the steps of the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Criminal Courts of Justice to declare: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Twenty four hours earlier Mr Justice John Aylmer had told jurors he was going to direct them to acquit Fitzpatrick. The former Anglo Irish Bank executive had pleaded not guilty to misleading the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditors about loans to him and people connected with him. Today, the 126th day of at bewildering and complex trial, Fitzpatrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence had argued that the case should not go before the jury because of flaws in the investigation process and in the prosecution case.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details shortly.... Investors searching for clues as to when the European Central Bank might start gradually reducing its stimulus measures will find little in president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments. In a speech in Madrid on financial stability, Draghi said there was no need to change its current guidance, saying the euro area was seeing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an increasingly solid recovery driven largely by a virtuous circle of employment and consumption, although underlying inflation pressures remain subdued.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: The macroeconomic environment is improving. The monetary policy measures put in place in recent years have proven to be effective at sustaining a resilient recovery that is increasingly broad-based across countries and sectors. This recovery in turn contributes to greater financial sector resilience...Nonetheless, we remain vigilant. Negative rates may also have unwarranted side-effects, but those have so far remained limited. Our current assessment of the side effects suggest therefore that there is no reason to deviate from the indications we have been consistently providing in the introductory statement to our press conferences. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tough few months for Tiffany &amp; co, with regular protests close to its flagship store in New York (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right next to Trump Tower...). And the upmarket jewellery chain has just delivered more bad news, with quarterly sales missing expectations in the last quarter. Shares in Tiffany have dropped almost 5% in pre-market trading, after it posted a 2% drop in comparable sales across the globe. Like-for-like sales in the America shrank by 4%, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower spending by both foreign tourists and local customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They fell by 3% in the Asia-Pacific region, and also in Europe, and by 1% in Japan. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade has made a small dent in the copper price. Copper traded on the London Metal Exchange has fallen 0.6% to $5,678 a tonne. Back in February it was trading at $6,200. Why hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy and rising debts caused more alarm? I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because canny investors (who have the same information as Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) already understood the challenges facing Beijing. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already priced its debt accordingly. Secondly: institutional investors are often forced, by their own rules, to sell sovereign debt after a downgrade because it is officially riskier. But Chinese debt is mainly held by Chinese investors, who wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the same compulsion. Alan Siow of BlueBay Asset Management explains: Downgrade largely expected and priced in, with China IG [investment grade] spreads trading wider to equivalently rated developed market and emerging market peers prior to the announcement. China IG issuance is largely owned by Chinese end investors (some estimates are as high as 80%), and foreign investors are underweight, so limited forced selling. Downgrade rational is uncontroversial and highlights well understood vulnerabilities (i.e. not new news) After being rattled by Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market managed to recover its losses by the close of trading. The Shanghai Composite Index closed up 1 point, or 0.06%, as investors digested the news that China had been downgraded by one notch to A1 (the fifth-highest rating). Vishnu Varathan, Asia head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, believes the one-notch downgrade will cause some angst, as Beijing deals with some of the bad debt incurred by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be quite negative in terms of sentiment,particularly at a time when China is looking to de-risk the banking system (and) when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be some potential restructuring of SOEs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Cheetham, chief market analyst at brokerage XTB, says China has now been bumped back up the list of worries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After being very much at the front and centre of global risk sentiment at the beginning of last year, the Chinese slowdown story has been almost forgotten, with politics throughout Europe and the U.S. taking the limelight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The price of iron ore traded in the Chinese city of Dalian slumped by 7% today, partly thanks to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade. Local reports also blamed signs that stockpiles are building up (suggesting a dip in demand). The wider iron ore prices also fell, but less steeply, adding to recent losses in the last few months. Fred Goodwin might still get his day in court, whether he likes it or not. A high court judge has agreed to adjourn the case brought by thousands of Royal Bank of Scotland customers who say they were misled into supporting its rights issue in 2008, before the financial crisis. The case was due to begin on Monday, with Goodwin (RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former CEO) expected to face questions over the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. But RBS then made a last-ditch offer to settle, which has split the investors. Both sides have now asked for a formal adjournment until June 7th, to allow talks to continue. From the high court, Jill Treanor explains: Jonathan Nash QC, representing the shareholders, told the judge on Wednesday that while prospects of a settlement remained good more time was needed. Asked by Hildyard what the impediments to a deal were, Nash said the shareholder group was not able to contact all its members. There were a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small number of shareholders whose current address does not appear to be correct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he added. The judge set a court hearing for 4pm on Thursday for an update and will require written updates next Tuesday and Thursday when the court is not sitting. This is from the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack: UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Donovan has a refreshingly blunt take on the Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade: One of the credit rating agencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no one cares which one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lowered China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from something to something else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no one cares what. There was a flicker of interest in Asian markets (an unusual reaction to a credit rating agency move), but there is no real new information. Karishma Vaswani, the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asia business correspondent, has explained why Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade will have irked the Chinese leadership: Remember - this is a critical year for President Xi Jinping, who faces a key political congress towards the end of the year. A strong economy gives him credibility and legitimacy - China observers tell me that the perception of stable growth is crucial for him at this time. This is why negative assessments from international financial institutions like Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Chinese debt are unlikely to go down well in Beijing. Currently, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt stands at something like 260% to GDP. Higher debt levels usually mean a higher level of risk. But it is worth noting that most of this debt is held by Chinese state-owned enterprises or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quasi-state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like entities - not international investors - so it is less likely to have a spillover effect into other economies. All the same, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy, what happens in China matters to the rest of the world. More here. Over in Sofia, European Central Bank policymaker Peter Praet has warned that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery could falter if the ECB tightens policy too quickly. Praet told his audience that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was recovering, thanks to domestic demand (thanks to the actions taken by the ECB!). But wage growth is still muted, meaning inflationary pressure is low. Praet struck a cautionary note, saying: While we are certainly seeing a firming, broadening and more resilient economic recovery, we still need to create a sufficiently broad and solid information basis to build confidence that the projected path of inflation is robust, durable and self-sustained. First, underlying inflation pressures still give scant indications of a convincing upward trend as domestic cost pressures, notably wage growth, remain subdued. And, second, the economic recovery and the outlook for price stability remain conditional on the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation, including our forward guidance. Without this support, the progress towards a sustained adjustment that we see in our projections will likely be slower or even stall. That might disappoint those who are pushing the ECB to start normalising monetary policy, and raise interest rates from their record lows. Mining shares in London have been hit by the Chinese downgrade. Rio Tinto has shed 1.2% while Anglo American is down 0.8%, following the drop in commodity prices (as China is a huge consumer of iron, nickel, copper, etc). Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group explains: The heavy sell-off in commodities following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt rating downgrade has taken its toll on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining stocks (-1.10%). Copper futures cheapened by 1.29%, as iron ore future slid more than 5%. The wider FTSE 100 has gained 13 points, back to 7499 points. Guardian Business is launching a daily email.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little surprising, as the retailer reported a 10% fall in underlying profits (and a 65% slump on a pre-tax basis) this morning, and another fall in clothing sales. But investors are hoping that CEO Steve Rowe is turning the business around;. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been talking up M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales of full-price clothing, after removing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excessive discounting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But DIY chain Kingfisher is having a rough morning. Shares are down 6% after reported a small fall in like-for-like sales, mainly due to a 5.5% slump in France in the last three months (was everyone too busy voting to put any shelves up?) Newsflash: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has just downgraded 26 Chinese organisations, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating downgrade. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all classed as GRIs, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-financial corporate and infrastructure government-related issuers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: The 26 issuers comprise 1) 17 GRIs and rated subsidiaries that are ultimately owned by the central government (central GRIs), and 2) nine GRIs and rated subsidiaries that are ultimately owned by regional and local governments (local GRIs). The list includes China National Petroleum Corporation, China Three Gorges Corporation, Guangzhou Metro Group, and Dongfeng Motor Group Company. Luc Froehlich, head of investment directing for Asian fixed income at Fidelity International, believes China has got a grip on its economic problems. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade is yet another sign of the challenges faced by China, which is juggling rising leverage issues, declining economic growth rates and ongoing structural reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite these mounting pressures, we are confident that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank and its regulators are firmly in control of the situation. In particular, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent regulatory tightening should help deflate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit markets and lead to long-term market stabilization. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade has hit the price of commodities in China. Iron ore shed 6%, with steel and coke prices also suffering, as traders anticipated weaker demand for metals and energy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to be dismissive of credit rating firms, given their shortcomings in the run-up to the financial crisis. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us anything massively new; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that China is facing rising debts, slowing growth, and a tricky tightrope from an industrial economy to a service sector one. But Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade will matter to Chinese firms; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably end up paying higher borrowing charges, now that Beijing itself is seen as riskier. The Wall Street Journal explains how Chinese banks already piggy-back on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating (which is higher than their own). Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gives the broader sector a baseline credit assessment of Baa3 based on indicators like loan-to-deposit ratios and counterparty risk. But because the government owns much of the banking system and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is assumed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwould provide it with support in a crisis, banks are in practice able to issue debt at higher ratings. Bank of China , one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big four banks, has a base rating of Baa2, but any debt it issues is rated at A1, four notches higher. By this logic, a notch down in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating should push down those of issuers that rely on government backing. In July 2007, when Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upgraded China, it simultaneously upgraded seven Chinese banks. Currently, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deems about half of the state-owned entities it rates as being in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate credit risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bucket. Thirteen of those companies would fall into junk territory if their ratings were lowered a notch. More here: Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen, believes Beijing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy about Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move: Balding told Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a psychological blow that China will not take kindly to and absolutely speaks to the rising financial pressures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter much in the grand scheme of things because so much of Chinese debt is held by state or quasi-state actors and minimal amounts are international investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says that investors won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be badly alarmed. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating overnight, to A1 with a stable outlook, from Aa3. There was an initial risk-averse reaction but this has been mostly reversed in the last few hours. The stable outcome and the fact that rating agencies are more market-following than market-leading, not to mention recent Chinese equity market under-performance, all argue that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no new news in this move. And so, the market reaction is to buy the dip, yet again. Analysts at Macquarie Group point out that Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade brings them into line with Fitch; so will Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be the next to downgrade China? S&amp;P has had China on outlook negative since February 2016, indicating there is a potential downgrade brewing. But S&amp;P currently rates China one notch above Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch, so a cut would not break new ground.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The last time Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded China was November 1989, a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests were crushed. The Chinese government has tried to dismiss Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade. It claims the move is based on an inappropriate, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pro-cyclical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach, that is too gloomy about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current situation and future potential. In a statement, the Minister of Finance says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These viewpoints overestimate the difficulties facing the Chinese economy and underestimate the capabilities of China to deepen supply-side structural reform and expand overall demand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Big news from China this morning. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has downgraded the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating for the first time in almost three decades. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength is likely to deteriorate in the coming years, as its economy slows and its national debt keeps rising. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-notch downgrade, from Aa3 (the fourth-highest rating) to A1. In a statement, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explains that Beijing is likely to drive borrowing levels higher as it tries to transform China into a consumer-driven economy. And it fears that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reforms will not fully offset the rise in economic and financial risk, As Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s put it: The downgrade reflects Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The agency added that debt levels across the Chinese economy are likely to keep climbing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects that economy-wide leverage will increase further over the coming years. The planned reform program is likely to slow, but not prevent, the rise in leverage. The importance the authorities attach to maintaining robust growth will result in sustained policy stimulus, given the growing structural impediments to achieving current growth targets. Such stimulus will contribute to rising debt across the economy as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move hit shares in China, sending the Shanghai Composite Index down to its lowest level since last October. More reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the US dollar. After being buffeted by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travails, the greenback is clawing back some ground as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates again in June. The minutes of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting are due out tonight (7pm BST), and could give some new clues about its next step. CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson explains: The US dollar appears to have caught itself a bit of a break yesterday ahead of the release of the latest Fed minutes. In the last week or so market odds of a June rate rise have fluctuated quite sharply, though the consensus still remains that it remains more or less a done deal. I still have doubts about that but the Fed do appear to have boxed themselves into a corner for a move in June, and one that they may find difficult to extricate themselves from if things do go a bit pear shaped in the next few weeks. Another central bank will also be in focus; European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving a speech on Financial Stability in Madrid this lunchtime. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Peter Praet is also on duty, and speaking at an event on \u00e2\u20ac\u015325 Years of the Association of Banks in Bulgaria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Sofia, Bulgaria. There may be developments in Greece, where the government has returned empty-handed from Monday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting. Pressure to unlock its next bailout payment in time for debt repayments in June is intensifying. In London, the court battle between Royal Bank of Scotland and irate shareholders who supported its 2008 rights issue continues. Will the investors accept RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last-minute compensation offer, or will they insist on seeing ex-CEO Fred Goodwin in court? The City of London remain subdued in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, with the FTSE 100 not expected to move much. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for retail news, with Marks &amp; Spencer, Kingfisher and Dixons Carphone all reporting results (more on that shortly).",

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have lagged behind their US counterparts. While New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 hit another record high, most continental bourses ended the day in the red. The FTSE 100 finished a little higher, though, partly due the pound weakening after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor GDP figures. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: UK and European markets have essentially traded in a sideways fashion for most of the week, and today is no exception. While US markets clock up new highs Europe remains becalmed, despite the fact that European data has been much stronger of late than its US counterpart. Across the Atlantic, Amazon and Google find themselves locked in a race for $1000; tech firms continue to leave the old economy far behind, with momentum continuing to drive the sector higher. In a bull market, you buy the strongest performing assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the Nasdaq 100 nearly a fifth higher year-to-date, it is clear that momentum lies here, leaving the staid S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 far behind. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Another former Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, has rushed to visit Lucas Papademos in hospital. Eurocrisis followers may remember that Papandreou was succeeded by Papademos, when his administration was replaced by a government of national unity in late 2011 after seeking its second bailout. The current governor of the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, is visiting his predecessor in hospital now. Stournaras told reporters that the letter bomb attack on Lucas Papademos was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cowardly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Kathimerini newspaper reports. The 4% plunge in the oil price tonight shows that Opec hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to curb crude stockpiles. Nizam Hamid, ETF Strategist in Europe at wealth manager WisdomTree, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited meeting has disappointed investors, with oil prices giving up recent gains after members dashed expectations of deeper cuts to production and merely reiterated the status quo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The falls may provide a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the long-term story for oil, but they also highlight the environment of heightened volatility which the commodity is facing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With supply side dynamics undergoing a fundamental shift thanks to the impact of US shale, only decisive action from Opec will boost prices from current levels, and so far investors have not been satisfied that Opec is tackling the issue aggressively enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for countries who import oil, of course. Car drivers might not see such sharp price rises at the forecourt.... Greek TV are reporting that Lucas Papademos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s injuries are not life-threatening, following this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explosion. The ex-PM has been taken to a hospital in Athens. The oil selloff is accelerating -- Brent crude is now down almost 4.5% at $51.60 per barrel. That shows that the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the plan to extend existing output cuts for another nine months. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says investors are disappointed that Opec didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree deeper production cuts: OPEC members had a chance today but bottled it. A nine-month extension just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to really lift oil prices as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to see US shale fill the gap. Having said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do whatever it takes, OPEC is looking a bit toothless now. Instead of deepening cuts they are continuing to tinker at the margins by curbing production by around 1.8m barrels/day along with several non-OPEC members. It also looks like no new non-OPEC members are joining the curbs, which would have helped. Newsflash from Athens: There are reports that a bomb has gone off inside the car of former Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos. Greek police say that Papademos and his driver have both been injured, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any more details. One report says it was a letter bomb. Papademos, who was also Greek central bank chief and a ECB vice-president, was installed as interim PM in 2011 after Greece signed up for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac130bn bailout. Letter bombs have been sent to several senior figures from the eurozone crisis in recent months, including German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. One exploded at the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Paris in March, injuring a member of staff. Oil prices are on the slide, following the news that Opec and non-Opec members have agreed to extend their production cuts until March 2018. Brent crude is down 2% at $52.82, while New York crude has dropped by 2.7%, below $50 per barrel. Traders may be concluding that the deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t succeed in propping prices up, as US shale producers can boost their own output. Delegates are briefing reporters in Vienna that a nine-month extension has been agreed, by Opec and non-Opec members. That means oil producers will continue to cut 1.8 million barrels per day off their combined output. Energy reporters are racing around the Opec headquarter again, as the official announcement from oil cartel is imminent. Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The technology-focused Nasdaq is also hitting all-time record levels Traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried by the prospect that US interest rates will rise next month. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Traders arrived at their desks this morning having seen the Fed minutes warn of overvaluations in asset prices, and hint at further policy tightening later in the year, and yet were confronted with new record highs in the S&amp;P 500 and the MSCI world index, while the US dollar is under pressure again. What an odd world we live in. Reuters are also reporting that Opec has agreed to curb supply levels for another months: OPEC decided on Thursday to extend cuts in oil output by nine months to March 2018, OPEC delegates said, as the producer group battles a global glut of crude after seeing prices halve and revenues drop sharply in the past three years. The cuts are likely to be shared again by a dozen non-members led by top oil producer Russia, which reduced output in tandem with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries from January. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cuts have helped to push oil back above $50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers, many of which rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets. Newsflash from Vienna: The Opec meeting has finished. The cartel are now being joined by non-Opec countries, to discuss whether they would also support today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rumoured deal to cut supplies for another nine months. Dutch bank ING don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply cuts will work, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry (which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be part of the deal) can boost its own production levels. The latest US trade data is a little disappointing. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has widened, to $67.5bn in April from $65.0bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because exports shrank by 0.9%, with US firms selling fewer cars and consumer goods overseas. Imports rose by 0.7%. That suggests that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may not be rebounding as strongly as hoped from its weak first quarter. But...the latest jobs data is more encouraging. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose by 1,000 last week, to 234,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than the 237,000 which Wall Street had expected, and close to its lowest levels in decades. Back over in Vienna, Opec ministers have been hammering out an agreement to extend their existing production cuts. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official yet, but the word on the ground is that the cartel will keep its current supply cuts for another nine months, through to March 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what investors had largely expected.... ...so the markets have shown their contrary nature, by sending the oil price down a bit. Brent crude is now down 1% at $53.43 per barrel, a whole dollar per barrel less than this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to our old friend \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the news, sell the rumour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some disappointment that Opec didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree deeper cuts. Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sticking to the 1.8m barrel a day deal first agreed in late November extended to March 2018. George Buckley, UK economist at Nomura, is concerned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate is now lagging behind European rivals. He writes: This is the first time in a year that UK growth failed to outpace that of the euro area (on average over the past 3-4 years the UK has grown a couple of tenths per quarter more strongly than the euro area). While UK real GDP is broadly the same as that of Germany relative to where it was at the start of 2008, Germany has produced its 8.5% increase in aggregate output over that period with no change in its population, compared a 6% rise in UK headcount (though the UK has experienced a more sizable rise in its dependency ratio). On a per capita basis, UK GDP did not expand at all in the first quarter of this year (in separate figures also published today official net migration fell to its lowest in three years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 248k in 2016). Housebuilding was a bright spot amidst the gloom spread by the unexpected downward revision to UK GDP today. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 43,170 new houses were started in England between January and March, up 3% on the previous quarter and up 21% on a year earlier. The number of completed houses rose to 39,520, 9% higher than the previous quarter and 21% higher than a year ago. Housing starts totalled 162,880 in the year to March, up 15% on the previous year, while completions rose 6% to 147,960. Andy Frankish of Mortgage Advice Bureau says more is needed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, the latest figures do indicate a marginal increase and we can see the signs of recovery starting in 2013, demonstrating the impact of the introduction of Help To Buy, which could suggest an element of cautious optimism that the industry has perhaps \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcturned the corner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 following the trough of 2009. But if we are to reach the 200,000+ new build homes needed each year in England, there is still more momentum required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even less chance of UK interest rates rising soon, despite inflation surging over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Hill reckons borrowing costs will remain at record lows until early next year. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbackcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has 0.4% q/q in for Q1, so this revised outturn of 0.2% q/q is marginal downside news for policymakers. In our view, this GDP report reinforces the existing case for not responding to above-target inflation. Indeed, we continue to see the risk that the slowdown in activity becomes more entrenched and ultimately results in monetary policy being loosened in Q1 2018. The next government needs to boost investment and drive up wages, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her take on the slowdown in UK growth in the last quarter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very worrying sign of the squeeze that families are feeling. Prices are rising faster than earnings, and households are getting deeper into debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next government will inherit an economy that needs serious attention. An urgent priority must be to reverse the current fall in living standards. The minimum wage must go up faster, and the pay restrictions on public servants like nurses, firefighters and midwives must be ended. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also vital for Britain to increase investment in communities where good jobs are in short supply. More investment is needed in skills, transport links, broadband, decent homes and high quality public services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The TUC has published analysis this morning (Thursday) showing that unsecured debt per UK household will reach a record high this year of \u00c2\u00a313,900. This exceeds the pre-crisis peak of \u00c2\u00a313,300 in 2007. Uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming exit from the European Union may have hit the economy, says ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Knightley: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth downgrade means that Britain was one of the worst-performing advanced economies in the first three months of this year. Only Italy and America did as badly as the UK; they also grew by around 0.2% in Q1 2017. France expanded by 0.3%, Japan managed 0.5%, while Germany posted healthy growth of 0.6% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP surged by 0.8%. The Eurozone and the EU both grew by 0.5%. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data, and discovered that things are even worse than we thought. The UK actually grew by just 0.18% during Q1 (which was rounded up to 0.2%), which is the worst performance in over four years. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, is concerned by the sharp slowdown in UK growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data indicate that the economy slowed even more than previously estimated in the first quarter of 2017, as consumer spending power was squeezed by rising prices. Excluding population growth, real GDP per head - the broadest measure of living standards in the economy - flatlined in the first quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Estimated GDP growth in Q1 2017 was revised down from 0.3% to 0.2% and further detail was released confirming that the slowdown was focused on consumer spending and related industry sectors such as retailing, hotels and restaurants, transport and communications. But he does spot some reasons for optimism- including the rise in business investment, and higher government spending too. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation confirms that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was ZERO in the last quarter, once you adjust for population increases. He also shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth since the financial crisis is rather less impressive on a per-capita basis (ie, growth per person). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report also shows that public sector workers are suffering the biggest impact from rising inflation (which hit 2.7% in April), as their wages are lagging behind the private sector. The ONS says: Compensation of employees, which includes wages and salaries and employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 social contributions, showed positive growth of 0.6% seasonally adjusted in Quarter 1 2017. Non-seasonally adjusted, growth was chiefly driven by strong positive growth in private sector wages and salaries, in turn driven by bonus payments typically made at Quarter 1 and a smaller fall in growth in private sector jobs than seen in previous Quarter 1s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This was partially offset by a small fall in public sector wages and salaries. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how net trade (red) had a negative impact on growth in January-to-March: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from the squeeze on real wages, as inflation overtakes earnings, says Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation. She explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the downward revision may have been unexpected, the reasons behind the weakness surely aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Sluggish household spending growth, a consequence of the squeeze on real incomes starting to kick in, and some pull back on export growth after an impressive end to last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the consumer weakness to persist as wage growth falls further behind rising prices, but there should be some turnaround on the trade front, driven by a brighter outlook in the rest of the world. For those on the hunt for some good news in the data it was to be found in the investment numbers. Business investment picked up at the start of this year and some big revisions to investment at the end of last year mean the investment picture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as dire as first thought. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to see this rebound continue and strengthen if for longer-term productivity prospects to improve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, also blames the rising cost of living: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just as expected higher inflation is squeezing incomes and spending. High inflation is hitting consumers, but a weak pound and a recovering global economy are helping businesses. UK growth is likely to tilt away from the consumer towards exports, manufacturing and investment this year. This should keep the UK economy growing at a similar rate to last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Only one City economist expected Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate to be revised down to 0.2% today, says Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ross Finlay. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, is disappointed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade was so weak last quarter, despite the weak pound: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor flags up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity crisis is even worse than we thought (figures last week showed a fall of 0.5%, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures suggest an even darker picture). But economist Rupert Seggins is encouraged that business investment rose (by 1.2%), despite the Brexit uncertainty. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow at all in the last quarter, if you account for the increase in population. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new figures show that GDP on a per-capita basis was flat in Q1 2017, compared to the final three months of 2016. So while the economy got a bit bigger, individuals didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually feel the benefit. The bad news is that net trade took a big bite out of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate. Net trade wiped 1.4 percentage points off the growth rate, dashing hopes that the weaker pound would be a massive boost to exporters. The ONS says. Within net trade, there has been a rise in total imports, which have contributed negatively to UK GDP, with a notable contribution from transport equipment, machinery and chemicals. And adjusting for inflation, household spending in the first quarter of 2017 rose by just 0.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest amount since the final three months of 2014 -- underlining how inflation is hurting. The good news is that businesses invested more in new plants and machinery at the start of this year. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) increased by 1.2% compared with Quarter 4 2016, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures confirm that UK households were hit by the impact of higher inflation, due to the weak pound. The Office for National Statistics explains: UK GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in Quarter 1 2017 as consumer facing industries such as retail and accommodation fell and household spending slowed. This was partly due to rising prices. Construction and manufacturing also showed little growth, while business services &amp; finance continued to grow strongly. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth in the first quarter of this year was even weake than we thought. Growth has been revised down to just 0.2% for January to March, down from the first estimate of 0.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest growth since the first three month of 2016, and shows that the economy is less robust then we thought. The ONS now believes that the UK service sector grew by just 0.2%, not the 0.3% first expected. Industrial output has been revised down too, from +0.3% to +0.1%. More details and reaction to follow! As expected, Iraq is also backing a nine-month extension: Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister says that a nine-month cuts extension is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly likely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to be agreed today. Khalid al-Falih adds that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any deeper cuts, though. That implies that the current agreement to shave 1.8m barrels-per-day off global outlook would be extended And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! A flurry of comments are hitting the wires as Opec ministers speak to reports. Kuwait\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister says he expects a nine-month extensions to the current output cut deal, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any deeper cuts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snap from inside the Opec meeting, via Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa. No pushing at the back, please. The journalists sent to Vienna to cover today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting are getting hot under the collar, literally. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been queuing, more-or-less patiently, in a stairwell for around an hour - waiting to be allowed into the opening session. These Opec meetings can get quite frenzied, as reporters compete to hear from oil ministers. Last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gathering was particularly heated - several ornaments were broken amid media scrums, and one reporter briefly lost her shoe. Some City analysts are sceptical about whether Opec can really influence the oil price, as many producers - such as America - aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the cartel. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd expect a nine-month extension to the current deal. Many are wondering if the group has any rabbits to pull of its hat to mitigate the risk of a buy the rumour, sell the fact reaction. It is not actually certain that the extension will be 9 months rather than six, even if the noises have been in that direction, or if any other Non-OPEC countries do sign up, they are at best likely to be very marginal producers such as Tajikistan, and per se more an optical addition than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgame changers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Oil ministers are arriving at the Opec HQ now. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live webcast from the hotel here. Three Opec delegates have told Reuters that a nine-month output extension is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most likely scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One says that a one-year extension (to June 2018) is an option. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amanda Cooper has the details: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full agenda of the Opec meeting (timings are in CEST, so knock off an hour for BST). Some background. Last November, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to cut their combined output by around 1.8 million barrels per day through the first six months of this year. That deal did drive the oil price over $50 per barrel, but any hopes (or fears) that prices would push higher have been dashed (or allayed). As this chart shows, the oil price actually dipped back in recent weeks, before rallying on hopes that the deal will be extended today. Queues are forming outside Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in the Austrian capital, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: The oil price is jumping this morning, on predictions that Opec will extend its existing output cuts today. Brent crude has gained almost 1% to $54.45 per barrel, and New York crude is up 0.75% at $51.75 per barrel. That underlines how the markets expect the oil cartel to agree to pump less oil at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has bolstered hopes of a nine-month extension -- and possibly even longer: Barclays analysts have argued that a mere six-month extension would be a blunder, as it would expire at the end of this year - when oil demand is weak. Extending the deal into 2018 would mean that Opec members would ramp up output when demand is strengthening. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Vienna this morning as energy ministers from the Opec oil cartel meet. On the agenda: whether or not to extend the oil production cuts deal which was agreed six months ago. Oil analysts broadly expect an extension to be hammered out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the alternative would spook the markets and send prices spiralling down. But the big issue is how long for. Saudi Arabia (Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest member) is pushing for a nine-month extension, and Iraq backed this plan earlier this week. But there have been whispers that Opec might only extend oil output cuts by a mere six months, or could go the whole hog with a 12 month deal. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all to play for in Vienna today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts that the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will get their way: The oil cartel meets today, and the market is expecting it to extend the period of production cuts by an extra nine months, through to March 2018. This has been widely signalled after Russia (a non-Opec member) and Saudi Arabia said that they would support an extension of the cuts last week. There is a very small chance that some of the smaller, struggling members of Opec, including Venezuela and Nigeria, may resist the prospect of further cuts, overall we think that Saudi Arabia will ultimately get what it wants from this meeting. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Opec should be wary of disappointing the markets: Also coming up today: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to get fresh information on how the British economy performed in the first three months of this year. The second estimate of UK GDP will reveal how business investment, net trade, personal spending and government spending changed over the quarter. The City predict that consumer spending took a dive, as rising inflation hits shoppers. Royal Bank of Canada say: It is expected that a much more modest contribution from the consumer will be behind the lower growth figure, as real household disposable incomes have been hit by rising prices. The Office for National Statistics is also expected to confirm that GDP only rose by a modest 0.3% in January-to-March, down from 0.7% in October-December. 9am BST: Opec opening session begins in Vienna 9.30am BST: Second estimate of UK GDP released 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 4pm BST: Opec press conference We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

In April when the election was called, a Conservative victory appeared all but secured, providing the government with a strong mandate to move forward with Brexit plans for negotiations, while also providing analysts more certainty as divorce proceedings with the EU got underway. Now, the very real possibility of a Labour victory with two weeks before polling day, however unlikely, raises the prospect of further disruption for analysts and a return to volatility in the pound as a new government determines the Brexit process.</p> <p>Whilst the pound has been able to remain steady in face of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tragic events and disappointing data, it is clear that the election is the most powerful driver behind the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency.

The pound is also wallowing at a two-month low against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.145. City traders are now rethinking the prospects of Theresa May securing a big majority in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even talk about a possible hung parliament, that might make the Brexit process even messier. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Markets says this has hurt the pound: The pound has been looking toppy as election odds narrowed since the release of the manifestos. The latest polls from YouGov showed the Tories with only a five-point lead over Labour. A five point gap looks to have been the breaking point. Polls are indicating a real chance of another hung parliament in the UK Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, adds: The precipitate fall in the pound is undoubtedly helping, with the currency taking a rather dramatic tumble below $1.28 as the script for the general election is torn up. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the moment that the script hit the floor.... The pound also suffered from an upgrade to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, which boosted the US dollar. That was a sharp contrast with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures yesterday, which showed growth was even weaker than first thought (at just 0.2%). Capital Economics say: Our view that the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent rally can continue as the economy remains resilient and Brexit worries gradually ease has been dealt something of a double blow by the downward revision to Q1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP figures and the YouGov poll for The Times showing a dramatic narrowing in the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lead over Labour to just 5 points. A warning that neither of the main parties are being honest about their manifesto commitments also dampened the mood in the City. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to stop this blog. Best wishes for the bank holiday weekend, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a rout! The pound has now fallen below $1.28 for the first time in a month, and has lost around 1.5 cents since the YouGov poll came out. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another depressing chart from the WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into pensions: Whoever wins next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, many younger Britons face working into the 70s thanks to the pensions crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the World Economic Forum today, which warns that rising longevity will drive pension deficits to staggering large levels without big changes. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The retirement age in Britain and other leading developed countries will need to rise to 70 by the middle of the century to head off the biggest pension crisis in history, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos said deficits in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six largest pension systems would more than quadruple to $224tn by 2050 unless people worked longer and saved more. With people born today having a life expectancy of more than 100, the WEF said the cost of providing security in retirement for a rapidly ageing population was the financial equivalent of climate change. It warned the huge and spiralling cost would imperil the incomes of future generations and set the industrial world up for the biggest pension crisis in history. The WEF said it had examined the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six biggest pension saving systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US, the UK, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and found that all were coming under strain from an expected global increase in the numbers over-65s rising from 600 million to 2.1 billion in 2050. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The anticipated increase in longevity and resulting ageing populations is the financial equivalent of climate change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michael Drexler, head of financial and infrastructure systems at the WEF. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must address it now or accept that its adverse consequences will haunt future generations, putting an impossible strain on our children and grandchildren.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Newsflash: American consumer confidence was a little weaker than expected this month, but still pretty high. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck of consumer morale has come in at 97.1 for May, down from the preliminary reading of 97.7. That up on April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 97.0, and close to its highest levels since the US election last November. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Richard Curtin, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer sentiment has continued to move along the high plateau established following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the pound drops further, the FTSE 100 hits fresh record highs. The blue-chip index is now up 30 points at 7552, a gain of 0.4%. The final trading day of the week is underway in New York. Shares have dipped a little, as investors get ready for the long weekend (markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day). The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 23 points, or 0.1%, to 21,060. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, reckons the Federal Reserve is now very likely to raise American interest rates next month: Upward revisions to 1.2% for first quarter growth have confirmed the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy to be in rude health, strengthening the case for a Fed rate hike on June 14th. [Fed chair Janet] Yellen will find the 0.60% quarterly uptick in consumer spending to be particularly pleasing ahead of what is being enthusiastically priced in by fixed income markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the implied probability of policy action was above 80% at the last count. Unless Donald Trump repeats his NATO tactics and shoulders his way into the headlines and barring any shock disappointments in the data calendar, no market event appears capable of preventing a mid-June US interest rate hike. James Knightley of iNG isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the first quarter of the year, even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been revised up to 1.2% (annualised) He points out that it still lags behind other developed countries (not Britain, alas): US 1Q 2017 GDP growth has been revised up to 1.2% annualised from the 0.7% figure initially reported. There were slight improvements in all of the key components, but it is still a very disappointing outcome, mainly caused by a clear slowdown in consumer spending and a run down in inventories. The US dollar has rallied after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first-quarter growth was revised up. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for the pound, which has now spiralled to a one-month low of $1.2811, down more than a cent today. Breaking! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the first three months of this year has been revised up. US GDP increased at an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannualised rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 1.2% in January-March, the Commerce Department says, up from an initial estimate of 0.7%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.3%, the same as France, and faster than Britain after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade to 0.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the weakest expansion since the first three months of 2016. Economists, though, think growth is probably rebounding quite sharply in the current quarter. The Commerce Department has revised up its estimate for consumer spending, from +0.3% to +0.6%. Business investment was also strong, rising by 11.4%. Insurance group Legal &amp; General has given Ireland a boost in its bid to attract City jobs after Brexit. L&amp;G has picked Dublin as the new European hub for its investment management arm. And while it may not create many new jobs, the Irish government will be cheered that its efforts to woo major financial firms is paying off. Earlier this month, JP Morgan bought an office block in Dublin, seemingly in preparation for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. The Irish Independent has more details: The move remains subject to regulatory approval, he said, stressing that the relocation would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have no foreseeable impact on operations and staff in other LGIM locations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The total number of new jobs may be fewer than 50, but the move represents a significant win for the Government given L&amp;G\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a household name within the industry. The investment manager is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest with more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 trillion in assets. It is known to be seeking a full EU base for after Brexit. Ouch! The pound just hit a three-week low of $1.2843 against the US dollar, as election nerves intensify. Chris Saint, senior analyst at HL Currency Service, says the decline in the Conservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader over Labour is causing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heavy losses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This adds an extra strand to political risks currently weighing on the pound, with markets previously taking it almost for granted that a larger parliamentary majority would hand Mrs May a stronger negotiating position in upcoming Brexit talks. Several of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks are the worst-performing stocks on the FTSE 100 so far today. Royal Bank of Scotland has shed 2.5%, with Barclays and Lloyds close behind. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of a wider selloff; bank shares across Europe have dropped, amid new worries about two Italian banks. Reuters has the details: Traders cited worries over the political situation in Italy and concerns surrounding ailing regional banks Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, even though the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister sought to reassure investors on Thursday that they will not be hit in any rescue of the two banks. Sterling is likely to remain volatile until the general election is concluded, suggests Paresh Davdraof of RationalFX. With the pound sliding below $1.29 against the dollar and at a two-month low against the euro, uncertainty over the outcome of the election is beginning to trouble the markets. In April when the election was called, a Conservative victory appeared all but secured, providing the government with a strong mandate to move forward with Brexit plans for negotiations, while also providing analysts more certainty as divorce proceedings with the EU got underway. Now, the very real possibility of a Labour victory with two weeks before polling day, however unlikely, raises the prospect of further disruption for analysts and a return to volatility in the pound as a new government determines the Brexit process. Whilst the pound has been able to remain steady in face of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tragic events and disappointing data, it is clear that the election is the most powerful driver behind the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency. The next two weeks could see more volatility for sterling as polling figures in the run up to the election become more frequent. Analysts will be looking for any definitive signs that the Conservatives can win the election before the pound can consistently return to the levels seen recently.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, Chris Beauchamp of IG suspects that the pound might claw back some of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, once traders have digested the latest polling data. Cable has spent the week trying vainly to break $1.30, but the most recent YouGov poll has empowered the bears. Such a polling bounce for Labour was also eminently predictable (a similar occurrence took place for the Conservatives in the 1997 election, and we know how that turned out), so we should see some cable buying as the session goes on. [Explainer: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is City slang for the pound-dollar exchange rate, dating back to the days when traders in London and New York used a cable on the Atlantic Sea bed to track it. Some bright sparks occasionally call it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBetty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 instead (rhyming slang from WW2 pin-up Betty Grable...)] The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness is good news for European tourists planning a trip to this Sceptred Isle this summer. One euro now buys 87.1p on the foreign exchanges, up from just 83.1p in mid-April. The other side of the coin is that Brits face paying more to holiday in Europe this summer. Bloomberg have created a neat graphic, highlighting how the pound is sensitive to next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory. A big Conservative victory is likely to drive sterling up, but a narrow win (or even a hung parliament) would spark a selloff. So YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll could potentially put sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the trouble zone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Neil Jones, head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling correlates well with anything that shows a Tory majority and vice versa, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got this situation where the majority closes right down, it may come to a critical level where it may not have a sufficient number of seats in the house. The market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased nervousness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the City over the Brexit negotiations, which should begin shortly after the election. None of the parties appears to have either a coherent plan for a post Brexit Britain, or any vision of a coherent leadership. While mid-campaign polling wobbles are nothing new, take the rogue Scottish referendum poll in 2014, neither of the main parties appears to have manifestoes which appear to add up with the Institute of Fiscal Studies criticising both. We also have a fresh record high on the FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK-focused companies. The FTSE 250 has romped over the 20,000 point mark for the first time ever this morning, extending its recent rally. Restaurant Group (owner of Frankie &amp; Benny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) has jumped 9% after reporting better sales figures than the City feared (like-for-like takings only fell by 1.8%) The Tory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrinking poll lead is raising concerns that no party might win an overall majority in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, says Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester. Rochester explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is likely to continue to be under pressure now until the election is out of the way, if polling continues to indicate it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tighter race.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the market the worst outcome is if we have further uncertainty with the chances of a hung parliament.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That uncertainty is keeping the pound pinned at a two-month low against the euro: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the YouGocv poll that has sent the pound dropping: In other election news, an influential economic thinktank has warned that neither of the two major parties are being totally honest with the public over the state of the UK economy. After analysing the election manifestos, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has given both Labour and the Conservatives a poor score. As IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The shame of the two big parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 manifestos is that neither sets out an honest set of choices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Conservatives are simply offering the public \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the cuts already promised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says the IFS: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compared with Labour, they are offering a relatively smaller state and consequently lower taxes. With that offer come unacknowledged risks to the quality of public services, and tough choices over spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the IFS are also critical of Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans; saying they would inevitably lead to higher taxes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For Labour we can have pretty much everything - free higher education, free childcare, more spending on pay, health, infrastructure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the pretence is that can all be funded by faceless corporations and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe rich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Our Politics liveblog has more details: Newsflash! The FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has just nudged 7534 for the first time ever, thanks to the weak pound. Ironically, the drop in sterling is helping Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market outperform the rest of Europe. Most European markets are in the red, dragged down by energy companies (who have fallen following the drop in the oil price). But the FTSE 100 has gained a handful of points, thanks to multinational firms who benefit from a weak pound. The Conservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shrinking election lead is the main story in the City this morning, reports Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: The most notable move came from sterling, which plunged half a percent against both the dollar, taking cable to a near 2 week low, and the euro, where the pound now sits at its worst price in around 2 months. The reason for this fall? Well, the latest election poll, conducted by YouGov for The Times, has seen the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lead slashed to just 5 points, with Labour continuing to mount a post-manifesto release comeback. Any growth managed by sterling since April has largely been predicated on the assumption that the Conservatives would secure a landslide victory. That this presently doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case has helped further erode confidence in the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current position. Sterling has also hit a two-month low against the euro, down 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.148. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A bout of general election jitters have sent sterling down to a two-week low this morning. The pound has lost almost a cent against the US dollar, after an opinion poll suggested that Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead over Labour has narrowed to just five points. The latest survey, from YouGov, has knocked the pound down by over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2858, a two week low, and the biggest one-day fall since early May. The poll is shaking the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence that Theresa May will win a large majority, possibly a landslide, on June 8th. That fuels concerns that Brexit could be even messier than feared, if May doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the substantial \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmandate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 she is demanding. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the poll could be signalling a shock Labour victory: Sterling fell again overnight after a poll showed the gap between Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour party has narrowed again. The lead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which only a few weeks ago stood at around 20 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has fallen dramatically to just five according to this YouGov poll. With this kind of momentum and almost two weeks to go until the vote, not only is this not going to be the breeze that May anticipated when she called the snap election last month, it could yet turn into a humiliating defeat for the Conservative leader and her party. However, Royal Bank of Canada don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the situation is quite that bad for the Tories. We note that the YouGov polls have tended to show a smaller Conservative lead than most of the other polls in recent weeks and also that YouGov says the swing in the latest poll is probably due to Conservative manifesto commitments, some of which have changed subsequently. Campaigning for the June 8 general election recommences today and there will likely be a large number of opinion polls over the weekend, so this picture could change either way in the next few days. Our Politics Live blog will be tracking all the action from the campaign trail, here: Also coming up Disappointment continues to ripple through the oil markets, after Opec and non-Opec members agreed to cut production for another nine months. Crude prices are down this morning, after tumbling around 4% yesterday, seemingly on disappointment that a more radical deal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day, as City workers prepare for the bank holiday weekend.

                "bodyText":"In an era where fake news is like a virus, media organisations need to be very careful that they are not adding fuel to the bonfire of fantasies. Even with the best of intentions journalists should be wary of arguing that government data is dishonest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as recent suggestions that the real unemployment rate is much higher than what the ABS would have us believe. Last week, the Australian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Creighton wrote two articles suggesting the unemployment rate is a basically a crock. One of the articles was titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Be honest about unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s above 15 per cent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the other had the headline, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real jobless rate well above 20pc\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (pick the number you think sounds most scary, I guess). Creighton argued that because the unemployment rate only counts people who have actively looked for work in the past four weeks it excludes people who would work but were not looking. He also added into the mix everyone who is underemployed and thus arrived at a total \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well above 20%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is not. Creighton has form on unemployment trutherism. In 2014 he suggested \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is now just shy of 51%. That is not a misprint.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He came to that number by counting everyone not working \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including children, stay-at-home parents and those who are retired. Little wonder last week he was writing glowingly of Donald Trump, noting that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least has had the courage to slam the US unemployment rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What Trump has done is suggest there are 94 million unemployed Americans rather than 7.9 million. He arrived at this figure by including everyone over 16 without a job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including students, retirees, stay-at-home parents (you see the pattern here). Trump has also suggested the unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is phoney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is the problem with Creighton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s article \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not that he is wrong to suggest that the unemployment rate may not tell the whole story (it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t), but once you start suggesting the number is dishonest, then you are very quickly down the rabbit hole of making up your own facts. And unfortunately many people will read such articles and be suckered into going down that rabbit role \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and before you know it politicians are dismissing official data because it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suit their agenda. Heck, in Senate estimates on Monday, One Nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Malcolm Roberts referred to the article in a question to the Treasury secretary. So let me say it clearly and plainly: the unemployment rate is not fake and it is not tricked up. The unemployment rate definition used in Australia and around the world is one set by the International Labour Organisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not an organisation all that disposed to hiding levels of unemployment. Aside from being able compare across nations, the common definition also helps stop governments changing it to make things look better. Creighton argues that the people who were available to work but weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking account for around 22% of all people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not in the labour force\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If we included them, it would increase unemployment by around 1.5 million and raise the unemployment rate from 5.8% to 15.9%. That might be nice if you want to come up with a big headline number to shock people, but would it really be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look at the reasons why these people were not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actively looking for work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In September 2013 (the last time the ABS looked at the makeup of people not in the labour force) only 13% of those who wanted to work but were not actively looking were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discouraged job seekers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They stopped looking because they felt their age, or lack of skills/education meant there were no jobs, or that the jobs weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in their region, or at suitable hours. They had given up, and they certainly deserve attention. The US Bureau of Labour Statistics includes such people in its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U-4\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unemployment rate (it has six types of unemployment rate, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U-3\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the standard one) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d happily agree the ABS should be funded to measure these people every month. If we included them, the unemployment rate would be raised from 5.8% to around 7.3%. Higher, yes, but hardly headline-blaring higher. What about the rest of the people who are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153willing to work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but not looking? Most are not in the labour force for family reasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either looking after children or an ill relative. The next most common reason is health \u00e2\u20ac\u201c short-term illness or injury, or long-term condition or disability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and being pregnant. And the third most common category (two-thirds more than discouraged workers) are those attending an educational institution. Does it really make any sense to include such people as unemployed? Sure they might work if an attractive enough job came along, but they are happy enough if one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t: The other common complaint about the unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Creighton raises it as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anyone working more than one hour a week is considered employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I get told this one almost every time I write on unemployment. For the love of God, please stop! It is not an issue. And what is more, you know it is not an issue. Ask yourself how many people you know who work only one hour a week? You might know someone, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bet you know a heck of a lot more who work more hours than that. We know this is the case because the ABS counts the number of hours worked by all employed.

In March, just 4.9% of all workers worked fewer than nine hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest amount on record. But the total is skewed by youth workers. If we count only workers aged 25-64, the percentage falls to a mere 2.6% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again the lowest on record: But even youth workers, although more likely to work short hours, are not doing so more now than in the past. The share of youth working fewer than nine hours has fallen since 2014 to 14.5%, and is now just above where it was in 2004: But let us assume we counted such workers as unemployed. This would raise the unemployment rate, but rather than give a more accurate view, it might actually distort the picture. Right now, the unemployment rate of 5.8% is the same as it was in April 2004, and yet an unemployment rate which counted one-to-nine hour workers as unemployed would be 10.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rate actually lower than such a rate was in April 2004: So excluding short-hour workers from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153employed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd actually makes things look better now. As I have written previously, the issue with underemployment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a boom of one-hour workers, but part-time work replacing full-time work. And this is another problem with coming up with broader rates of unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to stop discounting people, you end up exaggerating others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether it be people working short hours, or students not working, or stay-at-home parents.

Somehow I suspect not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially when Creighton also complains about people on Newstart who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actively look for work and blithely writes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153about 55% of 770,000 disability support pensioners claim psychological problems or muscle and joint pain; a portion of these might not be genuine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big issue of the labour force at the moment is underemployment. I have written on it often \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and have even argued that the unemployment rate is no longer the best indicator of economic health. But that is a long way from seeking to suggest the official figure unemployment is fake. And as anyone who has been out of work knows, there is a very great difference between having a job but wanting more hours and not having a job at all. We already measure both underemployment and underutilisation (unemployment and underemployment combined): My two favourite measures (as readers would know) are the employment to population ratio: And the per capita hours worked per week measure: But there is no one measure that tells the whole story. We should ensure our coverage reflects that. There is nothing wrong with creating new labour force measures, but we should be very wary of dismissing the official rates as dishonest. Doing so only serves to reduce people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in the impartiality of the ABS. And we should discourage anything that would give succour to politicians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who seek to undermine institutions by suggesting any data inconvenient to their policies is fake.",

Consumer spending, which has been a strong driver of growth since mid-2016, is slowing as a rise in inflation squeezes real wages.</p> <p>We expect that the UK economy will grow around 1.5% this year, slowing further to 1% in 2018 owing to a slowdown in investment amid Brexit-related uncertainty.</p> <p>The upward revision to our 2017 forecast from 1% previously recognises that the speed of the slowdown so far has turned out to be more moderate than we had previously estimated.

                "bodyText":"The recovery in the pound has left the FTSE 100 in the red after the index earlier hit a new all time peak, and it was a fairly mixed picture elsewhere. With Wall Street falling back, European markets had an uncertain feel about them, with concerns about the forthcoming elections, not just in the UK but in Germany and perhaps Italy too. But despite this, they did manage to record their fourth straight month of gains, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up 0.9% in May. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.56 points or 0.09% at 7519.95 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.13% to 12,615.06 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.42% lower at 5283.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.4% to 20,731.68 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.03% at 10,880.0 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.10% to 775.24 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 40 points or 0.19%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the correction to the earlier Chicago purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report: The initially reported headline figure for the Chicago PMI was apparently incorrect and Market News International has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it to 59.4 from 55.2 first reported. The update changed the entire complexion of the original report and renders earlier market analysis largely inoperative. It took the headline index from an initial report of a 4-month low to being a 30-month high. MNI removed the original May release from the ISM-Chicago website but did not explain its error. More on the UK election opinion polls: A recovery in the pound on the latest opinion poll news has taken the shine off the FTSE 100. Sterling is currently up 0.34% against the dollar at $1.2903, up from its low of $1.2767. The late positive run for the currency has seen the FTSE 100, which hit an intra-day high of 7586, slip into the red at the close, down 0.09% at 7519.95. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling is flying at month end. Some month-end positioning and new polls showing a renewed Tory lead helped lift the pound over the $1.29 handle, amid signs that trading in sterling will be fairly choppy in the coming days. It looks like the foreign exchange market has decided to shrug off that YouGov survey which indicated a hung parliament is the most likely outcome from the June 8th poll. Instead the pound was buoyed by a PanelBase poll that gives the Tories a very healthy 15-point lead over Labour. Following on from this a Kantar poll added to the positive sentiment after it revealed the Conservative share of the vote had ticked up one percentage point in the last week, to 43%. Meanwhile there are reports that the Chicago data from earlier has been corrected. The purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index was initially said to have fallen from 58.3 to 55.2, but now it has apparently been revised to show a rise to 59.4. Connor Campbell, marketing analyst at Spreadex, said: You can tell the election is just over a week away, as the market has been abuzz with volatility this Wednesday afternoon. In the UK polls have continued to be the main driver of trading, with the UK markets remarkably sensitive to each individual survey. The latest report came from PanelBase, which gave Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tories a 15-point lead over Labour, news that not only helped the pound erase its losses against the dollar, but sent the FTSE to a fresh all-time high. The fact that the pair moved in the same direction is notable, suggesting that the FTSE wants a Tory win just as badly as sterling, even if the weakened pound has been the main driver behind the UK index travelling to its current record levels. Things have calmed down since then, however. The FTSE has reverted to the 20 point rise it saw this morning, leaving it 40 or so points away from its intraday peak. As for the pound, while it has held onto its growth against the greenback, it still finds itself in the red against the euro, though sterling has lifted away from its 2 and a half week lows. Sterling has now recovered all its lost ground against the dollar, as a new poll from Kantar shows the Conservatives increasing their lead over Labour from 8 points to 10 points. Sterling is now 0.2% better at $1.2882 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2767. Against the euro the pound has recovered to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1476, down 0.16% after being as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1432. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen back from its record highs and is now up just 20 points or 0.27%. Back with the UK, and ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has raised its forecast for economic growth this year but warns Brexit related uncertainty will have an effect eventually. It said: The British economy grew at a quarterly annualised rate of only 0.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Consumer spending, which has been a strong driver of growth since mid-2016, is slowing as a rise in inflation squeezes real wages. We expect that the UK economy will grow around 1.5% this year, slowing further to 1% in 2018 owing to a slowdown in investment amid Brexit-related uncertainty. The upward revision to our 2017 forecast from 1% previously recognises that the speed of the slowdown so far has turned out to be more moderate than we had previously estimated. Otherwise, we have not fundamentally changed our view that post-Brexit uncertainty will eventually weigh on economic activity. The agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key points in its latest global assessment include: The improving outlook for global growth in 2017 appears to be sustainable as some of the biggest risks to advanced economies have subsided and emerging markets maintain their expansion. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects G20 economies, which account for 78% of the global economy, to collectively grow at an annual rate of 3.1% in 2017 and 2018, compared with growth of 2.6% in 2016. The potential damage to global trade and economic growth from a pursuit of protectionist policies in the US, and consequent retaliation, seems to have diminished for now. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects the ongoing recovery to continue in 2017 and 2018, supported by accommodative monetary conditions, a strengthening global economy and rising employment. The outcome of the French presidential election should also support recovery because it significantly reduces the risk of a European Union exit by a major economy. Another set of US data has missed expectations. Sales of previously owned US homes fell by 1.3% in April, compared to forecasts of a 0.5% rise. This is the second straightly monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors. The year on year fall was 3.3%, the first decline since December and the largest since June 2014. The association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market. Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously not translating to more sales. Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 9.0 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much faster than any rise they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve likely seen in their income. Despite Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive economic growth in the first quarter, the International Monetary Fund points to possible problems ahead: In the wake of the poor Chicago data, US markets have gone into reverse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 34 points or 0.17%, while the Nasdaq composite - have earlier hit a new high - has now slipped around 0.1%. The S&amp;P 500 is also down a similar amount. Over in the US, and a disappointing outcome from the latest Chicago purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index: This is the slowest rate of growth since January. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the UK was the joint-slowest G7 economy in the first three months of this year: Over in New York, the Nasdaq has just hit another record high at the start of trading. City traders are catching their breath after a busy morning of sterling volatility, and another record high on the FTSE 100. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, sums up the morning: What a comedy show this is turning out to be. Last night saw sterling tumble after research by the Times newspaper and YouGov suggested that there could be a hung parliament. Today, it retraced all of those losses after a Panelbase Poll showed that the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lead was not only intact but that it had risen to 48% from 47% previously, while the Labour party remained unchanged at 33%. Razaqzada adds that we should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get used\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the volatility. Sterling is currently reacting negatively to any narrowing in the polls between the two major parties mainly because of the threat of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of corporation tax increases, which is deemed by the market as growth-chocking and not so business-friendly. If new polls show support for Theresa May is falling then the pound could fall once again, and vice versa. It is as simple as that. Thus, UK data should continue to play second fiddle to politics until the elections are over. Meanwhile, the stock market is enjoying its best month of 2017. Selling in May and going away wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have paid off this year, yet anyway...... Newsflash: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by an impressive 0.9% in the first three months of this year, outpacing other advanced economies. Household spending and business investment helped to drive growth across the country in January to March, new figures show. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little weaker than expected; some economists forecast growth of above 4%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still means the Canadian economy is expanding at a healthy pace. Canada is the final member of the G7 to report its growth figures. And we can now see that the United Kingdom is officially the joint-worst performing member of the G7 so far this year. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP only expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017, as rising inflation and weak net trade dragged the economy back. That was a much sharper slowdown than feared. Figures released last week showed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer facing industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suffered a slowdown, exports fell, and the dominant service sector struggled as the weaker pound pushed up import prices. Here are the growth rates for the G7 members in the first quarter of this year: Canadian GDP: +0.9% growth German GDP: +0.6% growth Japanese GDP: +0.5% growth French GDP: +0.4% growth US GDP: +0.3% growth UK GDP: +0.2% growth Italian GDP: +0.2% growth Newsflash: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew slower than expected in the first three months of this year. Indian GDP expanded by 6.1% over the year, weaker than expected. Economists had forecast annual growth of between 6.5% and 7.8%. The FTSE 100 is continuing to hit new record highs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now reached 7576 points for the first time ever, up 49 points (or 0.66%). Banks are leading the way, with Standard Chartered up 3.3% and Barclays gaining 2.4%. Fashion chain Burberry is in demand too, with shares up 3.1%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index has just hit a new alltime high, as general election action continue to grip the City. The FTSE 100 index has hit 7563, up 37 points today, and breaking through last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak of 7554 points. Shares pushed higher after PanelBase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new poll gave the Conservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 15 point lead was released, calming fears over a hung parliament. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets seem to be saying that a strong Tory majority is better for the pound and better for equities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Neil Wilson of ETX. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensitivity to these opinion polls is a little concerning. This chart shows how sterling hit a six-week low after YouGov predicted a hung parliament, but bounced back as Panelbase reported a solid Conservative lead of 15 points. Newsflash: The pound is pushing higher after a new opinion poll gave Theresa May a 15 percentage point lead ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Panelbase report that the Conservative Party have 48% support, compared to Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 33%. That has sent sterling back up to $1.284, clawing back most of the losses since the YouGov poll released last night. James Andrews, head of investment management at Redmayne-Bentle, predicts that the pound is entering choppy waters. He fears that further losses against the euro and the dollar are likely, as the European economy recovers. We are likely to continue to see volatility in the Pound in the run-up to the election, and indeed for the foreseeable future, as Brexit negotiations step-up post the outcome of the election. Given the prolonged uncertainty ahead of us, not to mention this short-term election-driven uncertainty, it seems any relief rallies will be just that, and the Pound will find it difficult to sustain any upward momentum. In addition, further rate rises in the US and stronger fundamentals from the European economy will likely see strengthening of the Euro and the Dollar, providing further headwinds for Sterling going forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking particularly strong and stable. Instead, the worst-performing major currency so far today. Sterling has now sunk to a six-week low against the US dollar as the selloff picks up pace. The pound has fallen to $1.278, its lowest level since Theresa May called a general election on April 18th. The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage approvals hit a seven-month low in April pushed the pound lower: YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction that Theresa May could fail to win a majority in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election is also weighing on the pound, despite some scepticism over its accuracy. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management suggests the pound may bounce back, as other polls show the Conservatives winning a working majority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest poll suggesting a hung parliament is likely has shaken markets. Were this to be the outcome of the General Election on 8 June, we can expect a repeat of this behaviour, with significant volatility in sterling. Yet today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll distracts from the many others showing that a Conservative majority remains the most likely outcome, as is our base case. With no further indications of a hung parliament, the recent fall in sterling may be seen as a buying opportunity for investors. Unemployment across the eurozone has hits its lowest level since the financial crisis, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is gathering pace. The eurozone jobless rate dipped to 9.3% in April, reports Eurostat, the lowest in over eight year. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised down from 9.5% to 9.4%. Across the whole European Union, the jobless rate fell to 7.8%, from 7.9%. Eurostat estimates that 19.121 million men and women in the EU were unemployed last month, including 15.040 million in the euro area. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (3.2%), Germany (3.9%) and Malta (4.1%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (23.2% in February 2017) and Spain (17.8%). The eurozone youth unemployment remains disappointingly high, though, at 18.7%. There are now 2.617 million under-25s out of work, a drop of 419,000 compared with a year ago. Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has fallen to 1.4% this month, down from 1.9% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sharp drop, as prices returned to more normal levels following Easter. It should encourage the European Central Bank not to risk tightening monetary policy too quickly. Eurostat reports that energy prices rose by 4.6% compared with a year ago, due to the pickup in the oil price. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose by 1.5%, service sector prices gained 1.3%m, while industrial goods only inched up by 0.3%. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market cooled off in April, with mortgage approvals falling to a seven month low. Just 64,645 mortgages were approved by banks and building societies last month, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest increase since September 2016. Net mortgage lending also cooled off, with the smallest increase in a year, in another sign that potential housebuyers are being more cautious. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure follow signs that house price growth has been slowing, particularly in London. British households have become more upbeat about their personal finances and the economy despite the political uncertainty and rising prices in the shops, according to a new survey. UK consumer confidence defied economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for a dip and instead edged higher in May as measured in a monthly barometer from market researchers GfK. Its main index rose to -5 from -7 in April. Despite a rise in inflation and stalling wage growth, households were more upbeat about the state of their finances, the outlook for their finances and the state of the economy when compared with April. But on all three measures they were less confident than a year ago, when the UK had yet to vote for Brexit. The poll of 2,000 people on behalf of the European Commission also showed people were more confident this month that now was a good time to make a major purchase such as furniture. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have an unexpected uptick in the barometer this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said GfK spokesman Joe Staton. Newsflash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate since the country was reunified 27 years ago. The jobless rate across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy fell to 5.7% in May, new figures from the German Labour Office show, down from 5.8% in April. The number of people out of work fell by 9,000 this month, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to 2.536 million. This should cause some relief in Berlin, following some weaker-than-expected German retail sales figures this morning. Takings surprisingly fell by 0.2% in April, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline has helped to push up the value of multinational firms listed in London. Consumer goods giant Unilever, international packaging firm Monti and information group RELX (formerly Reed Elsevier) have all gained around 1%. This has pushing the FTSE 100 up by 20 points to 7545, only 10 points away from breaking last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alltime high. Edward Hardy of currency exchange firm World First reckons YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll should come with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major health warning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pollsters don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually project constituencies seat-by-seat and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason why; the margin of error leaves the likelihood of this poll coming true particularly small. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very fair point; City strategist Ioan Smith has also pointed to the large margin of error: But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the pound shedding half a cent against the dollar since the poll came out. Sterling has also lost ground against the euro this morning, losing 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.145. That means one euro is now worth 87.33p (compared to 76p before last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum). Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale believes the euro will keep climbing against the pound: The importance of politics as a market driver currently can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be overstated. Perhaps that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise anyone when the economic backdrop is relatively dull. This morning, the pound is the main victim again as a YouGov poll points to a possible hung parliament as the Conservatives risk losing seats in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to treat polls with suspicion but needless to say, we remain bullish of EUR/GBP even if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost my bet that it would trade above 0.90 by the start of this week Kathleen Brooks of City Index is sceptical about YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction, arguing that the pollster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s methodology is too untested to make such sweeping claims. She thinks it most likely that the Conservatives will win a small majority, but fears that even this could hit the pound. We think there is a chance of a deeper sell off back towards $1.20 if it looks like Theresa May won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a big enough mandate to agree a trade deal with the UK. The prospect of no deal from the Brexit negotiations has spooked investors and may continue to do so after this election. This could weigh on sterling and the broader FTSE 350 index. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcslim chance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a hung parliament, she reckons -- but it would certainly hurt sterling and share prices if it happened. We would expect the political uncertainty that could arise from a hung parliament and a potential change in leadership would weigh heavily on the pound and the FTSE 100. YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock forecast that the Conservative Party could lose 20 seats in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election is the talk of City this morning. The suggestion that Britain could be left with a hung parliament next week has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the financial markets, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He says: A hung parliament is the nightmare scenario for May. It would constitute a massive personal failure and undoubtedly make for great domestic political uncertainty at the worst possible moment for Britain. If Mrs May fails to get the thumping majority she hopes for, her position will be a lot less secure than before she called the snap election. Mrs May has made this campaign particularly personal and a failure to secure a large swathe of new Tory MPs would be seen a failure of hers. This risks throwing open a Tory leadership contest and the prospect of a hard-line Brexiteer in charge. Boris Johnson is waiting in the wings. A hung parliament could easily see Jeremy Corbyn become prime minister \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors simply wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where they stood. And that means the pound is now saddled with an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153added political premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd until the result is known. A new forecast that Britain could be left with a hung parliament next week has knocked the pound. Sterling fell below $1.28 after YouGov analysis , published in The Times, suggested that Theresa May could be left 16 seats short of an overall majority. This prediction has caused some alarm in the foreign exchange markets, where traders had been expecting that the Conservatives would secure a large majority. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, explains: In the currency market, it is the British Pound which has attracted the most attention as the latest polls from YouGov shows that the big gamble by Theresa May could cost her majority lead in parliament. This is not something which she has pictured but again, the same story goes for David Cameron when he took the gamble for the Brexit vote. The YouGov poll shows that her party could lose as much as 20 seats and Labour could gain nearly 30 additional seats. So much for all the rhetoric \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making her hand strong in the parliament\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This has taken a toll on the British pound, and it has lost ground against a basket of currencies. Aslam believes the pound is vulnerable to further losses too: Investors are worried about a hung parliament, and if we get more polling data which confirms that the possibility of a hung parliament is more real, we could see the British pound losing ground against the dollar and the Euro. We do think that the sterling-dollar pair could drop all the way to 1.26 mark if we break the support of 1.2752. YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts is controversial, though, as polling companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually produce these kind of seat-by-seat projections. And The Times itself admits that the estimates has plenty of wiggle room, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The poll allows for big variations, however, and suggests that the Tories could get as many as 345 seats on a good night, 15 more than at present, and as few as 274 seats on a bad night,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to get traders jittery..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the pound closely, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election campaign enters the final stretch ahead of the June 8 dash to the polls. The latest opinion polls are painting a mixed pictures; some suggest a solid Tory majority, others reckon Theresa May could even lose seats, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a testing time to be a currency trader. New economic data from the eurozone will hit the wires this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show that Europe kept creating jobs last month, as the recovery from the debt crisis continues. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate probably also fell sharply this month; taking some of the heat off the European Central Bank to consider tightening its stimulus programme. Canada will also be in focus later, when its first quarter growth figures are released. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to have been one of the best-performing advanced economies in Q1, outpacing the UK. The agenda: 8.55am BST: German unemployment figures for May; the jobless total is expected to fall by around 15,000 9.30am: UK consumer credit figures for April 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for April; the jobless rate is expected to drop to 9.4% from 9.5% 10am BST: Eurozone inflation figures for May; CPI rate is expected to drop to 1.5% from 1.9% 1.30pm BST: Canadian GDP for the first quarter of 2017; economists predict annualised growth of around 4%",

                "body":"<p>As the election on 8 June nears, the debate has intensified over how much Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frothy cappuccino-drinking economy can cope without endless dollops of interest-free credit.</p> <p>Financial regulators are worried about it. So are the debt charity workers who pick up the pieces when the debt merry-go-round grinds to a halt. And they should be worried. Many of the biggest, shiniest new cars zipping round UK streets would still be sitting on the garage forecourt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/08/credit-car-crash-sub-prime-crisis-cause-next-financial-collapse\">without ultra cheap credit deals</a> that rival mortgages for their rock-bottom rates.</p> <p>On the high street, shops have in recent years relied more heavily on consumers using their credit cards for big purchases. Back in 2014 these shoppers could avoid paying the 18.9% interest commonly applied to credit card balances and use the two, even three-year interest-free period many card operators allow.</p> <p>As we know from recent experience, when debt bubbles burst, they hit everyone and drag the economy down into recession. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/aldi-lidl-sales-growth-uk-market-share-supermarket-raise-prices\">The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent data for April</a> shows that the mania for borrowing last year and the year before has paused somewhat since January. That should be seen as good news. Net mortgage lending is down at levels seen a year ago while unsecured borrowing on credit cards and loans has stabilised at a growth rate of of just over 10% a year.</p> <p>But not everybody at the Bank of England will be content to see consumers putting their credit cards in a drawer. The economists attached to the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate-setting committee know the economy runs on debt. To adapt a well-known first world war poster, they know Britain needs borrowers. </p> <p>If a reminder of this basic economic rule was needed, it was made clear earlier this month when the latest UK GDP figures appeared. The relative lack of borrowing in the first three months of the year coincided with a dive in GDP growth from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016 to 0.2% in the first quarter of this year.<br></p> <p>The BoE has busted a gut to keep the mortgage market afloat with one scheme after another to subsidise everything from deposits to the lenders themselves. It must have been upsetting to see a fall in approvals for house purchases in April for the third month in a row.</p> <p>Now there are signs that the credit habit is returning as almost zero interest rates work their magic again, Easter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending is out of the way and wage rises are being outpaced by inflation. Analysts say GDP growth in the second quarter will be higher for this very reason. Is that a return of consumer confidence with shoppers shrugging off the election, they ask? Or is it, as the debt charities suspect, cash-strapped consumers rolling over their debts and taking out a bit more credit just to get by?</p> <p>The latest consumer surveys back up the debt charities. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household survey revealed Britons are the gloomiest they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been since 2014 about their personal finances. The GfK consumer confidence survey was down in May, according to the seasonally adjusted version. So it could be that extra borrowing is born of distress rather than confidence.

                "bodyText":"As the election on 8 June nears, the debate has intensified over how much Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frothy cappuccino-drinking economy can cope without endless dollops of interest-free credit. Financial regulators are worried about it. So are the debt charity workers who pick up the pieces when the debt merry-go-round grinds to a halt. And they should be worried. Many of the biggest, shiniest new cars zipping round UK streets would still be sitting on the garage forecourt without ultra cheap credit deals that rival mortgages for their rock-bottom rates. On the high street, shops have in recent years relied more heavily on consumers using their credit cards for big purchases. Back in 2014 these shoppers could avoid paying the 18.9% interest commonly applied to credit card balances and use the two, even three-year interest-free period many card operators allow. As we know from recent experience, when debt bubbles burst, they hit everyone and drag the economy down into recession. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent data for April shows that the mania for borrowing last year and the year before has paused somewhat since January. That should be seen as good news. Net mortgage lending is down at levels seen a year ago while unsecured borrowing on credit cards and loans has stabilised at a growth rate of of just over 10% a year. But not everybody at the Bank of England will be content to see consumers putting their credit cards in a drawer. The economists attached to the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate-setting committee know the economy runs on debt. To adapt a well-known first world war poster, they know Britain needs borrowers. If a reminder of this basic economic rule was needed, it was made clear earlier this month when the latest UK GDP figures appeared. The relative lack of borrowing in the first three months of the year coincided with a dive in GDP growth from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016 to 0.2% in the first quarter of this year. The BoE has busted a gut to keep the mortgage market afloat with one scheme after another to subsidise everything from deposits to the lenders themselves. It must have been upsetting to see a fall in approvals for house purchases in April for the third month in a row. Now there are signs that the credit habit is returning as almost zero interest rates work their magic again, Easter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending is out of the way and wage rises are being outpaced by inflation. Analysts say GDP growth in the second quarter will be higher for this very reason. Is that a return of consumer confidence with shoppers shrugging off the election, they ask? Or is it, as the debt charities suspect, cash-strapped consumers rolling over their debts and taking out a bit more credit just to get by? The latest consumer surveys back up the debt charities. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household survey revealed Britons are the gloomiest they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been since 2014 about their personal finances. The GfK consumer confidence survey was down in May, according to the seasonally adjusted version. So it could be that extra borrowing is born of distress rather than confidence. And the starting point for extra borrowing on credit cards and loans is already 10% more each year. Of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spenders, the Financial Conduct Authority estimates that 3.3 million are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistent credit card debt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which means they are paying 18.9% interest or more and suffering the consequences. That leaves Britain with a choice between accepting the assurances of regulators that they can manage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tottering personal debt mountain or clamping down and risking lacklustre, sluggish growth. If only Melrose was in it for the long haul It is Bonus Bingo time again. The four top directors at Melrose Industries, an engineering group and turnaround specialist, are to share share a bonus pot of \u00c2\u00a3160m, paid in shares. Each will be handed \u00c2\u00a340m. The quartet run a business, just admitted to the FTSE 250, which turns around struggling manufacturers and sells them on at a premium price. They pay lots of tax due on those bonus shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this case \u00c2\u00a370m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which they will cover by selling a few of those shares.
