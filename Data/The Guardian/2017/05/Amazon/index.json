The US digital giant is using live gigs, which industry body UK Music says are worth about \u00c2\u00a31bn a year to the economy, as the latest sweetener to attract customers to its Amazon Prime subscription service.

The international backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this environment, the role for monetary policy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. Therefore, as labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary accommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC. </p> </blockquote> <p>And that does not just mean rate rises:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Removing policy accommodation goes beyond increasing the level of the federal funds rate. The Federal Open Markets Committee also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities holdings. The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion, or almost 25 percent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago. ...My own view is that the process should begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and long-term Treasury securities. </p> <p>Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio should be on autopilot and not reconsidered at each subsequent FOMC meeting. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5911df16e4b0a8ea08b6ca45\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-09T15:26:02.045Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Those expecting a market sell-off from the current highs could be disappointed, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite a lacklustre open, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 have already notched up record highs, while European markets have put in healthy gains.</p> <p>We have a market with no news, and no volatility, and this leaves us wondering what the next move will be.

This is not a buying frenzy, but more a case of a careful pick-and-choose market.

Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax reached a new closing high, while the FTSE 100 ended at its best level since the middle of April. In the US, both the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 hit new intra-day highs.

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\\ll be back tomorrow. Many analysts believe another US interest rate rise is on the cards when the Federal Reserve gets together for its regular meeting in June. And in a speech in California, Kansas City Fed president Esther George has added to that impression. Indicating she believed the US economy was strong enough for further hikes, she said: The economy continues to expand as sustained job growth and solid gains in household spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the weak first quarter notwithstanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are mutually reinforcing. The international backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this environment, the role for monetary policy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. Therefore, as labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary accommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC. And that does not just mean rate rises: Removing policy accommodation goes beyond increasing the level of the federal funds rate. The Federal Open Markets Committee also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities holdings. The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion, or almost 25 percent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago. ...My own view is that the process should begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and long-term Treasury securities. Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio should be on autopilot and not reconsidered at each subsequent FOMC meeting. Those expecting a market sell-off from the current highs could be disappointed, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Despite a lacklustre open, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 have already notched up record highs, while European markets have put in healthy gains. We have a market with no news, and no volatility, and this leaves us wondering what the next move will be. Everyone is looking for the next selloff, or at least the reason for the next selloff, so we will probably go without one throughout the summer. This market has the look of an express train, refusing to stop to let anyone on board. At least in London the rally has a broad-based look about it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are seeing bargain hunters lifting the mining sector, but banks, retailers and housebuilders are also on the up. This is not a buying frenzy, but more a case of a careful pick-and-choose market. The tone is cautiously bullish, but with one eye on potential bumps in the road. And on the falling gold price, he says: It is possible to imagine a world where gold prices keep falling right to June and the next Fed rate hike. Dollar strength continues to wreak havoc in commodity prices, but for gold all hope of a bounce appears to have gone. Instead of slowing down, the slump seems to be picking up speed once again. With stock markets moving higher after the French election and the volatility index on the slide, investors are shunning assets traditionally seen as havens in difficult times. In particular, gold has fallen to an eight week low, down around $8 an ounce to $1217. UBS analyst Joni Teves said: Gold is currently facing pressure amid diminished political risks out of Europe and market participants anticipating the Fed to hike rates in June... With one of the largest political risk events [the French election] now cleared, some consolidation is warranted, albeit political uncertainty lingers in Italy and is likely to remain for some time. For now, the focus is likely to shift to monetary policy at the Fed and the ECB, which implies economic data will need to be closely watched. Further pressure cannot be ruled out for now, but we expect bargain hunting to emerge and physical buying to strengthen should the market test $1200, paving the way for a recovery. More signs of confidence in the US jobs market. Job openings were steady at 3.8% in March compared to February, according to the Labor Department, as was the quits rate at 2.1%. The latter is a key measure for Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, since it indicates workers are confident enough about the jobs market to move on. The actual numbers showed an increase from 3.03m to 3.1m. And Apple is not the only one: With US markets moving higher, Apple has hit another peak, adding 1% to more than $154 a share and valuing the iPhone company at more than $800bn. The company has crossed that barrier despite falling iPhone sales, which has been put down to consumers waiting for the next model to be launched later this year. And analysts at US broker Drexel Hamilton believe the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares could climb even further, putting a target value on the business of $1trn. A strong US company results season and the outcome of the French election have pushed American markets higher again. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have both edged higher at the open to touch yet new highs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 8 points or 0.04%. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Dax hitting new peaks: After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muted response to Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend victory in the French elections, European markets have belatedly picked up the pace. In Germany, the strong trade data and a weaker euro have helped the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to a fresh intra-day high. The Dax is currently up 0.65% or 82 points at 12,776 having earlier hit a record of 12,783. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.34% and the FTSE 100 is ahead 0.75%, with the UK index helped by a recovery in mining stocks and shrugging off the falls in energy company shares after the Conservative price cap proposals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another chart showing how market volatility has fallen sharply in recent weeks to the lowest level since 1993, and MUCH lower than in the financial crisis. As explained earlier, the fall in the VIX means people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buying as many S&amp;P 500 options as usual (to hedge themselves against hefty swings in the markets). That suggests investors are more confident about market conditions. That could be justified, as economic conditions may be picking up as European political risk fade. Or it could be dangerous complacency. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know, either way, in a few month time.... Over in Australia, the major banks are reeling after being hit with a new tax. The Australian government announced the levy in its 2017 budget today. It will raise over six billion Australian dollars from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big five banks over the next few years. Each will pay upwards of A$300m per year based on their liabilities. Treasurer Scott Morrison claimed that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair contribution from our major banks, similar to measures imposed in other advanced countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More pertinently, it allows the Australian government to target a small surplus by 2021. But the banking industry is predictably irate. Australian Bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association chief executive Anna Bligh claimed it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political tax grab to cover a budget black hole,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and hinting that the public would pay the price. The banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a secret stash of money ... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only three places they can get this from \u00e2\u20ac\u201c borrowings, deposits or shareholders or a combination of all three and every Australian has an interest in one of more of those parts of a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations. Curiously, Australian bank shares slid before the policy was even announced, as rumours of a new tax swirled. Perhaps someone should impose a tax on leaks.... And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our liveblog on the Australian budget: The job vacancies total in Germany has hit a record high, in (yet) another sign that its economy is robust. The number of unfilled positions jumped by 9,000 in the first quarter of 2017, according to new research from the IAB institute. That means there were 75,000 more vacancies than a year earlier. Rising vacancies often suggests that an economy is growing faster than its labour force, which ought to give workers leverage for higher pay. Global stock markets have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153found their mojo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. He cites five reasons: Optimistic is derived from hopes that OPEC will extend [oil] production cuts at month end; Macron can form a working parliamentary majority; the Fed will hike because the US economy warrants it; the ECB will keep the QE taps open a little longer, and base metals prices have found a bottom after their recent sell-off. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has risen to its highest level since Theresa May triggered next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. The FTSE 100 has now gained 42 points today, or 0.6%, to 7343. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 100 points away from its all-time high set in March. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid German trade data is helping to support shares across Europe, as it suggests global economic demand is holding up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for mining companies, who continue to dominate the risers. Energy firms, though, are falling after the May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party outlined plans to cap standard variable bills. Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, are down 1.6% while rival SSE has lost 1%. Chris Beauchamp of financial trading site IG says a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bullish sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has returned to the City, although the energy cap plan is causing some angst. In London the embattled mining sector is finally seeing some support, despite little sign of a real turnaround in the ongoing fall in commodity prices. At the other end of the spectrum, Centrica leads the utility sector lower as the Conservatives bang on about their energy capping policies. Such a move is emblematic of the Conservative party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more interventionist stance. It will start with energy companies, but some will be wondering whether other sectors will come under pressure as well. So much for the Macron bounce! The euro has just dropped below $1.09 against the US dollar for the first time since last Thursday, having hit a six-month high on Sunday night. John Wyn-Evans, Head of Investment Strategy at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, has issued a research note on European politics following the French election. He flags up that the next potential pitfall comes next month: There are France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative elections to the National Assembly on June 11th, when we will see whether or not M.Macron can consolidate his position with a parliamentary majority. In truth, this looks like a tall order for his En Marche! Party which now has to find 577 candidates to field. Even so, there is a fighting chance that a working coalition can be formed with other parties to push through a reformist agenda. Matters can hardly be much worse than under Francois Hollande\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lame duck regime. The next crisis could come from Italy, Wyn-Evans continues, where the Five Star movement is challenging mainstream pro-EU parties: Looming larger is Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forthcoming general election, which has to take place by May 2018. For Marine Le Pen, read Beppe Grillo; for the National Front, read the Five Star Party (5*). Although 5* is not, perhaps, as ideologically extreme as the National Front, it is definitely anti-establishment and not a fan of a more integrated Europe. But the threat is tempered by the fact that it is only polling around 30% of the vote (neck and neck with the Democrats) so would need to form a coalition to pursue its aims. Furthermore, a referendum on membership of the euro would require constitutional change, and former Prime Minister Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to do just that failed last year, suggesting an underlying resistance to big changes within the country. In any event, you can expect a sharp increase in the volume of commentary on Italian politics once a firm date is set, and markets to enter another period of uncertainty. One of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most senior left-leaning politicians has thrown his support behind Emmanuel Macron. Manuel Valls told French radio that he wants to run for Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En Marche! campaign in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary elections. This may fuel speculation that Valls could potentially serve as PM under Macron - a position he has held before. Reuters has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will be a candidate for the presidential majority and I wish to join his (Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) movement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Valls, who was prime minister in Francois Hollande\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration between 2014 and 2016, told RTL radio. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Socialist party is dead. It is behind us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The essential thing today is to give a broad and coherent majority ... to Emmanuel Macron to allow him to govern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in January, Valls failed to win the nomination for the Socialist party to succeed Hollande. Instead, the party chose Beno\u00c3\u00aet Hamon, who trailed in 5th in the first round of voting as voters deserted France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional parties. At first glance, the news that Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear gauge had hit its lowest level since 1993 sounds reassuring. The VIX index (officially the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CBOE Volatility Index\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) measures market volatility by tracking a number of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoption calls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- contracts to buy or sell securities at a certain price in the future. It goes up when investors are scrambling for protection, and goes down when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not. So recent moves show that the markets are calmer. But, this situation rarely lasts long - as volatility has a nasty habit of rearing up again. One problem with low VIX is that investors can be tempted to add too much risk to their portfolios in a mad dash for a higher return on their investment. Anothe danger is that investors might lack protection for a stormy day, if they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken up options contracts to hedge their exposure to the markets. Johan Javeus, chief strategist at SEB Group, has tweeted a graph showing how the VIX fell to a 24-year low last night: FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed fears that the low VIX could lure some investors could be tempted into risky trading: While this could be interpreted to mean that good times lie ahead, it also indicates that the party may be over soon. Volatility does not stay at low levels for prolonged periods of time, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to see the index reverting to its 200-days moving average around 15. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the extremely quiet market conditions trap you into taking huge risks. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says the fundamental problem is that central banks have distorted the markets by through their stimulus programme: Super-easy monetary policy is creating artificially low volatility and driving money into trades and investments that are mispriced as a result. After dropping yesterday, European stock markets are all rising this morning. Mining companies are leading the FTSE 100, with Glencore up 3% and Antofagasta gaining 2.5%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures show that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy continues to power ahead, says the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan: Year on year exports were up an impressive 10.8 per cent in March while imports climbed 14.7 per cent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a sign of healthy foreign demand for German wares and buoyant consumer appetite within the country which boasted its best level of growth in six years last year. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall trade surplus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which hit a record in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is now at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25.8bn. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant trade position is under the microscope again today, with new figures showing that it is importing and exporting more than ever before. German exports jumped by 0.4% in March, to a record-breaking \u00e2\u201a\u00ac118.2bn. The rest of the world mopped up goods from major German companies, and the smaller firms that make up the Mittelstadt. But it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a one-way trip; German imports jumped by 2.4% in March to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac92.9bn. So the overall surplus actually dipped during the month, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25.4bn, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25.8bn a year earlier. That probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assuage critics who claim Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus is destabilising the world economy. Destatis, the statistics body, says: These are the highest monthly figures ever reported for both exports and imports..... In March 2017, Germany exported goods to the value of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac68bn to the Member States of the European Union (EU), while it imported goods to the value of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac61.1bn from those countries. Compared with March 2016, exports to the EU countries increased by 8.7%, and imports from those countries by 13.5%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has been As Associated Press put it: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export imbalance is widely criticized by other countries, which accuse Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy of not doing enough to spur domestic demand for foreign goods. Berlin counters that products made in Germany are simply better than the competition. Separately, German industrial output in March was better than expected. Output fell by 0.4% during the month, compared to forecasts of a 0.7% decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following the excitement of the French presidential election, the markets are rather subdued this morning. After being relieved that Emmanuel Macron beat Marine Le Pen on Sunday, the City is are now pondering whether the En Marche! founder can actually deliver on his pledges. Some investors are now looking ahead to this autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German elections, and also to Italy, where the anti-EU Five Star Movement are topping the polls. As London Capital Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jasper Lawler puts it: There are more political risks on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horizon. Legislative elections in France in two months, German elections and perhaps a snap Italian election could yet see the European project derailed. Italians have already demonstrated a willingness to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvote with their feet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when they blocked a government referendum late last year. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no drama yet. Shares are creeping higher in early trading, after volatility in the markets hit its lowest since 1993. That shows that investors are pretty confident right now. Too confident? Maybe, given the looming Brexit battle and the fact the world economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in top gear. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: The reason is that the Macron victory does not mean that we are out of the woods, there are still massive challenges ahead of him and the issue of soft and hard Brexit is still very much in play. US Earnings for the Q1 were a little soft and the US GDP growth is nowhere close enough to its previous level- let alone what Trump wants. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic or corporate diary to spook investors today, apart from new German trade and industrial output figures. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said that was one reason for the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current surge:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE left its international peers in the dust this Tuesday, the UK index rocketing more than 1% higher to hit a record peak of 7530.

However, the Bank of England appears reluctant to combat rising prices with a rate hike; combine that with the alarming squeeze on real wages and the pound has little reason for cheer, something that only works in the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. </p> </blockquote> <p>A weaker sterling boosts business at the exporters and overseas earners which dominate the FTSE 100, and although the relationship between sterling and the leading index has been rocky recently, it seems to be in place today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591b08c0e4b0762dda0bb708\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-16T14:15:29.678Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the higher than expected UK inflation figures, and economists at Barclays believe this will not necessarily put any more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/864481033122709505\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Barclays on UK inflation: Strengthens our view that the BoE will keep its monetary policy stance unch. over our forecast horizon (1/2)</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/864481033122709505\">May 16, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/864481063367737344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">...

His victory in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election solidifies the euro and eradicates the threat to the West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organisational structure from nationalist parties who wanted to break up the Eurozone. This is a powerful tonic for markets, especially when Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is starting to pick up and the ECB is toying with the idea of tapering at some stage later this year. Markets may continue to bask in Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, but it could be cut short in mid-June when we get the National Assembly elections. If Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly formed En Marche! Party cannot get enough members into parliament to push through Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical agenda, then the Macron rally could lose some of its lustre. However, the next month could be strong for European equities, as political risk recedes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Secondly, central banks are still driving the markets:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Central banks are also driving the markets, with the Fed expected to raise interest rates next month, and the ECB continuing with its enormous stimulus package. The soft patch of economic data for the US in Q1 this year means that the Fed could put the brakes on its rate hiking efforts for a few months after the expected June hike. A little bit of tightening isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to hurt this stock market rally, but too much of it will, thus, a hike from the Fed in June and then a pause would probably be the best outcome for global stock markets. In contrast, a strengthening European economy is giving rise to expectations that the ECB will have to announce some form of taper perhaps as early as this summer. But that is good for stocks also, as it would suggest a confidence in the Eurozone economy that would also be welcomed by investors. Thus, this rally may still have further to go.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591ac869e4b0f5ae171e28d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-16T12:12:23.337Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">House price inflation slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Although UK inflation is rising sharply, UK house prices are cooling as the London property boom falters.</strong></p> <p>The average British house price rose by 4.1% in the 12 months to March, the weakest growth since October 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2a3cd7bc0dbd696e7e1a6b9f749133e38665983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a3cd7bc0dbd696e7e1a6b9f749133e38665983/0_0_849_554/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK house price growth\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Prices rose fastest in the East of England and the East Midlands, at 6.7% per year, followed by the West Midlands at 6.5%.</p> <p>Prices shrank by 0.4% in the North East, while in the capital they only rose by 1.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"588e753d4c657ee84aeaa9e72e9cc4bdd637d820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/588e753d4c657ee84aeaa9e72e9cc4bdd637d820/0_0_844_553/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK house prices by region\" width=\"500\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>London house prices are still more than twice the national average, though, at \u00c2\u00a3472,000, followed by the South East at \u00c2\u00a3312,000 and the East of England at \u00c2\u00a3277,000.

                "bodyText":"In a volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, the UK stock market has outpaced its peers, with the FTSE 100 closing above 7,500 for the first time. Investors have been buoyed by hopes of further infrastructure spending in China, which has boosted commodity company shares, a strengthening oil price on the back of suggestions an output cut would be extended and a dip in the pound against the euro after higher than expected inflation figures. But after hitting new highs earlier in the week, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped back, with a mixed performance from other European markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished at a new closing high of 7522.03, up 67.66 points or 0.91% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.02% to 12,804.53 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.21% lower at 5406.10 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.38% to 21,787.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 10,982.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.83% to 788.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 11 points or 0.05%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated Lloyds Banking Group story with the latest developments: The UK government has reportedly sold off the final part of its stake in Lloyds Banking Group, the legacy of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout following the financial crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story from the weekend: On the FTSE 100 reaching 7,500, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: An improving global economy, a weaker pound and higher commodity prices are behind the surge in share prices. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite amazing to think the footsie has gained 2000 points in the last fifteen months against a background of weak investor confidence. In the short term the market can of course move in either direction but investors will be thinking that the 8,000 mark is hovering into view. After hitting yet new highs earlier, the S&amp;P 500 has edged lower although the Nasdaq Composite is managing to just about keep in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is around 200 points shy of its peak, has also slipped back. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: While the FTSE 100 has continued to clock up record highs this afternoon, the same cannot be said of the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones. Both indices seem stuck in limbo, unable to move higher. Perhaps some of this is down to nervousness following the latest Trump news, as the president takes to Twitter to defend something that his aides last night said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do (are we all keeping up?). But aside from that, US markets are bereft of reasons to move. Still, the old adage \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnever short a quiet market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 applies here; while Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going up, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going down yet either, and if the past few months have taught us nothing else it is that a grind higher is more likely than a big correction. It took17 years for the FTSE 100 to go from 6000 to 7000 - from April 1998 to March 2015 - although it came close on the last day of 1999 before the dotcom bubble burst. But it has taken just over two years for the leading index to climb from 7000 to 7500, showing how the pace has accelerated in recent times with the 8000 barrier now in the sights of investors. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The UK stock market reached a new milestone today when the FTSE 100 hit 7500 for the first time. Investors seem to be feeling confident about the outlook for Britain under what is expected to be the biggest Conservative party majority since Margaret Thatcher... Data from the ONS showed price inflation in the UK at its strongest since 2013. Rising inflation tends to make stocks relatively more attractive to bonds, which could make the next big hurdle for the FTSE of 8000 more achievable. The pound may be holding up against a weak dollar but it has fallen back against the euro following the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figure, currently down 0.86% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1647. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said that was one reason for the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current surge: The FTSE left its international peers in the dust this Tuesday, the UK index rocketing more than 1% higher to hit a record peak of 7530. The continued recovery of its key commodity stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of BP, Rio Tinto and Anglo American all rose between 1.5% and 3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was joined by the pleasing sight of a sterling slide, the currency dropping 0.8% against a souped-up euro. In months previous the kind of inflation figure produced this morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the CPI reading hitting its highest level since autumn 2013 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would have caused a bit of a headache for the UK index. However, the Bank of England appears reluctant to combat rising prices with a rate hike; combine that with the alarming squeeze on real wages and the pound has little reason for cheer, something that only works in the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. A weaker sterling boosts business at the exporters and overseas earners which dominate the FTSE 100, and although the relationship between sterling and the leading index has been rocky recently, it seems to be in place today. Back with the higher than expected UK inflation figures, and economists at Barclays believe this will not necessarily put any more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates: (QIR is the Quarterly Inflation Report issued last week) And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the US stocks at new peaks: With global markets hitting new peaks, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story looking at five reasons for the rise: DING DING goes the opening bell on Wall Street, opening a new trading day in New York. And shares are rallying, sending the S&amp;P 500 and the technology-focused Nasdaq to fresh record highs. In better news, US factory output jumped by 1% in April \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fastest rate in three years. Ouch! The US dollar has just hit a new six-month low, after new disappointing economic data from America. The number of new house-building projects (or housing starts) fell by 2.6% in April, the Commerce Department reports, following a 6.6% slide in March. That send the dollar down against a basket of currencies, and the euro up to a six-month high of $1.1085. A weak US housing market may well mean less pressure to raise America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rates.... Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, suggests that the Footsie could now make a run at 8,000 points. She says: Considering it took five months for the FTSE 100 to jump 500 points, if momentum is maintained over the summer months then we could see 8,000 in this index by October. She agrees that there are several reasons to be cautions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from global cyber-attacks, and North Korea missile to the political tensions in America. But there are two reasons why shares can push higher, she argues. First, the political developments in Europe, where the threat of populism has receded in recent weeks: Looking at politics first, the markets reacted with glee to the election of Donald Trump last November, European indices are now doing the same with Emmanuel Macron in France. His victory in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election solidifies the euro and eradicates the threat to the West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organisational structure from nationalist parties who wanted to break up the Eurozone. This is a powerful tonic for markets, especially when Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is starting to pick up and the ECB is toying with the idea of tapering at some stage later this year. Markets may continue to bask in Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, but it could be cut short in mid-June when we get the National Assembly elections. If Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly formed En Marche! Party cannot get enough members into parliament to push through Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical agenda, then the Macron rally could lose some of its lustre. However, the next month could be strong for European equities, as political risk recedes. Secondly, central banks are still driving the markets: Central banks are also driving the markets, with the Fed expected to raise interest rates next month, and the ECB continuing with its enormous stimulus package. The soft patch of economic data for the US in Q1 this year means that the Fed could put the brakes on its rate hiking efforts for a few months after the expected June hike. A little bit of tightening isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to hurt this stock market rally, but too much of it will, thus, a hike from the Fed in June and then a pause would probably be the best outcome for global stock markets. In contrast, a strengthening European economy is giving rise to expectations that the ECB will have to announce some form of taper perhaps as early as this summer. But that is good for stocks also, as it would suggest a confidence in the Eurozone economy that would also be welcomed by investors. Thus, this rally may still have further to go. Although UK inflation is rising sharply, UK house prices are cooling as the London property boom falters. The average British house price rose by 4.1% in the 12 months to March, the weakest growth since October 2013. Prices rose fastest in the East of England and the East Midlands, at 6.7% per year, followed by the West Midlands at 6.5%. Prices shrank by 0.4% in the North East, while in the capital they only rose by 1.5%. London house prices are still more than twice the national average, though, at \u00c2\u00a3472,000, followed by the South East at \u00c2\u00a3312,000 and the East of England at \u00c2\u00a3277,000. Houses in the North East are cheapest, on average, at \u00c2\u00a3122,000. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, suspects that the jump in inflation is weighing on the housing market. Higher inflation is contributing to buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nervousness about prospects for the property market and making them more determined to achieve the best possible deals. There are concerns about affordability and possibly jobs being compromised mainly because changes in exchange rates are pushing prices up and making goods more expensive. It underlines once again the importance of realism from buyers and vendors, particularly the latter, if they want to transact. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122The house-price figures are a little concerning bearing in mind 12 months ago how active the market was as buyers struggled to beat the stamp duty surcharge deadline. But they are not really surprising when you appreciate how the market has changed in that time and a new sense of balance between supply and demand is prevailing which has contributed to where we are now - a more subdued market with fewer transactions, softening prices and more realistic buyers and sellers.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This chart from Danske Bank shows neatly how inflation (the blue line) is now rising faster than earnings (the red line): That means real wages are falling -- as people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay packets can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep up. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (which campaigns against poverty) explains how poorest households are suffering from rising prices: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show the cost of living is creeping ever higher for families, including the cost of essentials such as food, clothing and electricity bills, at a time when wages are stagnant and working-age benefits are frozen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings figures are expected to show that pay fell at the start of 2017, while inflation is set to continue increasing over the year. We know people in the poorest households spend roughly \u00c2\u00a31 in every 6 on food and \u00c2\u00a31 in \u00c2\u00a313 on energy bills, meaning they feel the squeeze more when costs go up. Boom! The FTSE 100 index of the biggest companies listed in London has just hit another record high. The FTSE has rattled through the 7,500 point mark for the first time ever, up almost 50 points today. Mobile network giant Vodafone continues to be the best-performing company today, after reporting financial results at 7am. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 analyst Michael Hewson says: Vodafone are in demand this morning despite reregistering a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.1bn annual loss. The telecoms company wrote-off a large loss in its Indian operation but traders focused on the increased dividend and rosy outlook for next year. After an early spike, the pound has fallen back to $1.288 as the City digests today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures. Traders may be concluding that the Bank of England is likely to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (ie, ignore) rising inflation, on the grounds that raising rates now would cause more harm than good. Michael Baxter, economics commentator for the Share Centre, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although one member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy (MPC), Kristin Forbes, voted for a hike in interest rates in the last meeting, the minutes made it clear that other members will only join Ms Forbes in voting for a rise, if inflation starts surprising on the upside. So far, this has not happened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is nothing in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data to suggest that the MPC will deviate from its current course. The odds of an increase in UK interest rates later this year are diminishing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fund manager Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management fears that rising oil prices will drive inflation up this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as Opec producers are poised to extend their current production cuts. He argues that small investors should be looking to buy shares, rather than invest in bonds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The news that UK inflation rose to 2.7 per cent in April - tracking well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two per cent target for the next few years - undermines the appeal of gilts and bonds. With yields below the rate of inflation, capital is effectively being eroded. These are ideal conditions for a potential return of the cult of equity, which although riskier, looks favourable in current market conditions. The rate of inflation could be forced even higher by the price of oil, as this may nudge upwards due to OPEC action this month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c resulting in an even more compelling argument for equities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, warn that inflation is likely to keep climbing this year, hitting the UK public in the pocket. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has risen to its highest level since the autumn of 2013, and this is adding to the squeeze on consumer spending shown in the latest retail sales figures. We should expect this rise in inflation to continue as the impact of the weakness if the pound feeds through into higher prices for imported goods and services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is set to rise to around 3pc or higher in the months ahead - with prices likely to be rising faster than wages. The resulting squeeze on consumer spending will reinforce the slowdown in economic growth we are now seeing. Last week, the Bank of England warned that real wages would fall this year as rising prices erode households incomes. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures show that they were right. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, blames the slump in the pound on the EU referendum result: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now starting to feel the real impact of Brexit on our wallets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escaping the fact that the luxury of low inflation is well and truly over with prices of goods and services rising left right and centre and the shiny new pounds in our pockets will unfortunately buy you less. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your household budget will be stretched as the cost of fuel, energy and anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made overseas is creeping up. The cost of your supermarket shop is rising too so you must act now to protect yourself from future struggles.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So what can people do to protect themselves? Maundrell has four suggestions: check you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a fixed rate energy tariff (one that guarantees the price you pay per unit) and if not switch make sure your savings are earning an interest rate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than the rate of inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll lose buying power over time shop around for food and fuel so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying any more than you need to check whether you could cut your mortgage repayments by switching to a fixed rate deal if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SVR TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is urging politicians to heed the living standard squeeze and come up with policies to boost job creation and pay. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing Britain needs is another real wage slump. But rising prices are hammering pay packets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Working people are still \u00c2\u00a320 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why living standards must be a key battleground at this election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the parties need to explain how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll create better paid jobs, especially in the parts of the UK that need them most. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And there needs to be a recognition across the political spectrum of the damage pay restrictions in the public sector are doing. Nurses shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to use food banks to get by.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, says workers are suffering as pay rises fail to keep pace with inflation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As expected, CPI rose in April to 2.7% , with rising air fares a major contributor thanks to the later date of Easter this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of rising air fares was partially offset by a fall in fuel prices, but at just above the 2% target, this rate of inflation is not high by UK standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However with wages still sluggish, despite the sharp fall in unemployment, growth in real wages is being squeezed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elliott Silk, commercial director at wealth manager Sanlam, points out that rising inflation is bad news for savers and pensioners. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in inflation for the third month in a row is likely to damage retirees buying power and is set to take out a serious chunk of peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nest eggs. Many don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate the true cost of inflation. For those who retired before 2010 and took out a fixed annuity, the cost can be staggering. As bills rise across the board, retirees on a fixed income begin to feel the inflation pinch. As we enter this period of increased inflation, one of the ways people can consider avoiding inflation eating away at their hard earned cash is to seek out alternative investment vehicles.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shilen Shah, bond strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, is concerned that core inflation is rising. Higher electricity and clothing prices were somewhat offset by lower motor fuel prices, however the underlying inflation figure does indicate some inflationary pressures in the economy with the core CPI print increasing to 2.4%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that UK real wage packets are now falling, with inflation rising faster than pay rises: This chart shows how inflation is now rising at the fastest rate in almost four years, having jumped to 2.7% in April. Airfares jumped by 11% in April compared to March, while clothing prices jumped by 1% month-on-month. The chart shows how these were the main factors pushing inflation up: The inflationary pressures are broad-based, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c prices in every category of goods and services were higher in April 2017 than in 2016. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like food and energy, has also jumped. Core CPI has leaped to 2.4%, from 1.9% in March, suggesting that underlying inflation pressures are building fast.... Higher air fares drove inflation up in April, says the Office for National Statistics, due to Easter falling later in 2017 Rising prices for clothing, vehicle excise duty and electricity also contributed to the increase in the rate, the ONS adds. Here we go! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 2.7% in April, up from 2.3% in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than the City had expected. It means that means real wages are falling across the economy, as earnings including bonuses only rose by 2.3% in the three months to February. More to follow! The FTSE is cling onto its record levels, as City traders bite their knuckles and wait for the April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report to flash across their screens at 9.30am precisely... Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, due in just 10 minutes.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shrugged off the impact of the rising euro, and hit a new alltime high. The DAX is up 0.2% at 12,834 points, led by chemicals firms Linde and Bayer, and Deutsche Telekom. Newsflash: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only managed mediocre growth in the first three months of this year. Italian GDP rose by 0.2%, weaker than the UK and France (which both managed 0.3%) and well behind Germany (+0.6%). Over the last year, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has only grown by 0.8%, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to pull down unemployment or erode its huge debt pile. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx warns that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK inflation report, due in 35 minutes, could dent the Footsie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. The FTSE is still in the all-time record high ballpark this Tuesday, though it faces a tough test with the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. The index is still being propped up by its commodity stocks, though at an admittedly reduced pace, with the oil and mining sectors still high on Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery and the $900 billion \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSilk Road\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 infrastructure plan in China. The FTSE won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an easily ride this morning, however, as it deals with the latest, likely soaring, piece of inflation data. Analysts are expecting the CPI number to jump from 2.3% to 2.6% month-on-month, a reading that would be the highest in more than 3 and a half years. In theory this would inject a bit of life into the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is currently up 0.3% against the dollar but down 0.1% against the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could, potentially, cause the UK index to fall from its current peak. It will be a test of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience to see how it copes with this challenge, and may help indicate the longevity of these highs going forwards. Bad news from the Netherlands; its growth rate slowed to just 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, down from 0.6% in October-December. But things look rosier in Eastern Europe; Romania has expanded by 1.7% in Q1, while the Czech Republic grew its GDP by 1.3%. The euro has rallied to its highest level since the US presidential election. The single currency has gained 0.5% this morning to $1.1027, a level last seen in November 2016, as traders anticipate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone GDP report at 10am BST. A stronger euro is bad news for Eurozone exporters, so the German DAX and French CAC indices have both dipped in early trading. The FTSE 100 is continuing to scamper into uncharted territory; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now reached 7475 points, 20 points higher. Telecoms firms, consumer-focused companies and energy providers are up this morning, with Vodafone, DIY chain Kingfisher and housebuilder Barratt leading the risers. But easyJet is dragging the market back, after reporting that its losses have widened in the last six months. Boom! The FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading. The blue chip index has gained 8 points to 7465, beating the previous record of 7460 set on Monday. Vodafone is the top riser, up 3% after reporting results this morning. Traders are looking beyond its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn loss, and comforted that it sees improving cash flows. Vodafone has also told reporters that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan to move operations out of the UK, saying Brexit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a big difference to its operations. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market could hit a new record high this morning, say spreadbetters IG, after closing at an alltime high last night. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit fresh record highs overnight as the long rally refuses to fizzle out. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Index, which tracks equities across the globe, has tickled up to a fresh lifetime high, after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and the US S&amp;P 500 all hit new peaks on Monday. Optimism over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silk Road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plan is helping to drive the rally. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to spend hundreds of billions of dollars for new roads, ports and other infrastructure is likely to drive up commodity prices, which boosted miners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares yesterday. Market volatility is also hovering around its lowest level in decades, tempting investors to keep buying. Saudi Arabia and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to keep oil production curbs in place for another nine months is another key factor. Chris Weston of IG explains: Clearly the big talking point yesterday was the punchy moves in the barrel courtesy of a determined and cohesive stance from the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Russian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about extending the output cuts for a further nine months. The market is always going to react when we see collusion between these two oil heavyweights, especially when they pull out a famous Mario Draghi line and pledge \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to do whatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to bring down global inventories. Also coming up today At 9.30am the latest UK inflation report is released. Economists predict that the cost of living jumped again in April, as the weak pounds drive up import costs. The consumer prices index is tipped to jump from 2.3% to 2.6%, which would mean real wages are still falling. We also get Italian GDP figures at 9am, and an update on eurozone growth at 10am. That may confirm that the euro area expanded by 0.5% in the first three months of this year. There may be drama in Greece, as workers go on strike in protest at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme, ahead of a parliamentary vote on further cuts on Thursday. On the corporate front, mobile giant Vodafone, budget airline easyJet and housebuilder Crest Nicholson are among the companies reporting to the City. Vodafone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressive; it has reported a net loss of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.1bn loss, partly due to a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.7bn writedown on its Indian operations. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red ink at easyJet too; it made a half-year loss of \u00c2\u00a3236m, as the late Easter and the weak pound hit its bottom line. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

In <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2017/html/ecb.mg170518.en.html\">the minutes of the meeting</a> just released, the ECB expands on this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there was broad agreement that the configuration of risks to euro area activity had improved overall, some members considered that the risks to real GDP could now be characterised as broadly balanced, in particular given the improvement in recent data and indicators and the decline in political uncertainty. Other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed and that a change in the risk assessment was premature in view of continued risks and uncertainties, even if diminishing, both globally and in the euro area.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is more detail on the outlook and the risks involved: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Members exchanged views on the outlook and risks for the external environment, also taking into account the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, which had been released after the Governing Council meeting in early March, and the related discussions at the IMF spring meetings. It was underlined that the latest data on global activity and trade pointed to stronger global growth momentum and a re-synchronisation of the recovery, between global growth and trade and between advanced and emerging economies. However, the external outlook was considered to be still subject to elevated uncertainty, and the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was assessed to remain on the downside. </p> <p>Among the factors that continued to contribute to this uncertainty were the scope and timing of the future policy choices of the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the European Union, the rebalancing of demand and the transition towards lower growth rates in China, and developments in other emerging market economies. In particular, reference was made in the discussion to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding short-term developments in the US economy, which reflected a significant divergence between hard and soft data for the United States. Moreover, financial market participants and investors were reassessing the outlook for US growth and inflation, as it appeared that US data were no longer exceeding market expectations, and there was still considerable uncertainty surrounding the new US Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, including the prospects for fiscal stimulus, and their likely expansionary effects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d8340e4b0ca009308d9b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T11:21:20.111Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales figures should be treated with a little caution, says economics editor Larry Elliott:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/uk-retail-sales-best-forecasts-despite-pay-squeeze\">Britain went on a spending spree in April. </a>The shops were full of punters.

But in fact the figures beat expectations handsomely, with sales in April 2.3% higher than in March and growing 4.0% year-on-year. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were always expected to be better than March, because of the timing of the Easter holiday, but economists had forecast a smaller rebound of 1.0%, and much more subdued annual growth of 2.0%. </em></p> <p><em>The ONS says April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warm weather encouraged people to spend on food, home improvements and gardening equipment.</em></p> <p><em>The balance of probability suggests that at some point the combination of higher inflation and lacklustre wage growth will take its toll on the UK consumer. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers provide some welcome evidence the economy has made a brighter start to the second quarter following disappointing GDP growth of 0.3% in Q1. With the labour market looking relatively robust, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible the current mood of pessimism is unjustified.</em></p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit:</h2> <p><em>April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp rebound in retail sales gives a boost to second quarter GDP growth prospects. It buoys hopes that consumer spending will not hamper UK GDP growth as it clearly did in the first quarter.</em> <em>It is evident that the more than halving of UK GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017 (from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016) was primarily the consequence of previously buoyant consumers reining in their spending as purchasing power was hit hard by inflation and low earnings growth combined.</em></p> <p><em>However, April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in retail sales looks unlikely to mark the beginning of a renewed upturn in consumer spending given the sharp and increasing squeeze on purchasing power.</em></p> <p><em>April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent rebound in retail sales was clearly helped substantially by warm weather lifted sales of outdoor products. There is also the possibility that the later Easter had some beneficial impact although the ONS indicated that the data are seasonally-adjusted to allow for this.</em></p> <p><em>The suspicion is that it needs something special like markedly warmer weather to currently get consumers to really loosen their purse strings, given the marked dilution of their purchasing power in recent months.</em></p> <p><em>Worryingly for UK growth prospects, the squeeze on consumers looks highly likely tighten further over the coming months as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the pressure reinforced by ongoing muted earnings growth...</em></p> <p><em>There is also a strong likelihood that consumer confidence and willingness to buy major items will soften \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it is not only pressurised by weakened purchasing power but also by increasing concerns over the economy and perhaps job security...</em></p> <p><em>It is also questionable as to whether the labour market can continue to hold up given the growth slowdown and uncertain outlook (including likely difficult Brexit negotiations with the EU coming increasingly coming to the forefront after the 8 June general election is done and dusted.</em></p> <h2>James Smith, economist at ING Bank:</h2> <p><em>A big rebound in retail sales is likely to prove temporary, as the ongoing squeeze on household incomes starts to weigh more heavily on consumer activity over coming months.</em></p> <p><em>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data was clearly boosted by warmer weather and a late Easter, which helps retailers sell their summer wares (particularly clothing and household/garden items) in higher volumes, but also at more profitable prices. A rainy, cold early Easter makes the lives of retailers much trickier in this respect.</em></p> <p><em>Whilst that is likely to account for much of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% MoM gain in retail sales (ex. auto fuel), we have to remember that these figures are extremely volatile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very likely that there are seasonal adjustment issues, as statisticians struggle to keep pace with ever-changing consumer habits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rise of Black Friday style sales is a good example.</em></p> <p><em>To us, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the underlying story, where the squeeze in household incomes is starting to weigh on consumer activity. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in inflation (2.7%) and subdued wage growth (2.1%) means real incomes are now falling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that much of the strength in consumption over the past few months has been driven in no-small-part by higher borrowing and lower savings, which is unlikely to prove sustainable.</em></p> <p><em>For that reason, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Bank of England to hike rates before 2019.</em></p> <p><em><br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d6050e4b03ddbc8d5a978\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T08:50:47.289Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of the retail sectors:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b07cf4adcc71807455d95840e9d976bb2d05538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b07cf4adcc71807455d95840e9d976bb2d05538/0_0_705_662/500.jpg\" alt=\"retasles1\" width=\"500\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d5e4be4b0a9ae59334caa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T08:42:47.524Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling could move even higher, according to David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound is trading higher across the board this morning and the recovery seen in the currency since hitting a multi-decade low in January has been impressive and looks set to continue.

Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that he was amazed that investors had become so blas\u00c3\u00a9 about political risk, until it was staring them in the face.

At this stage, the main question is if it will survive the June legislative elections...</p> <p>The [unemployment] trend is yet to be confirmed in coming quarters however, as the unemployed population increased by 41k in the first quarter after having declined by 60k in the second half of 2016. The move was mainly due to the fact that one part of the population under training or subsidised jobs reintegrated the main unemployment statistics as they failed to find a job after this period. This illustrates the weakness of the subsidised system: without a strong recovery in private sector job creation, it can only be a temporary success. These difficulties were illustrated this morning by ILO data showing that the employment rate failed to increase among the active population it remained at 64.7%. Finally, figures released this morning showed in particular that unemployment among the youngest workers (15-24 y.o) remains very high at 21.8%.</p> <p>This is probably the main task of the new Government, in particular for Mrs Penicaud, the new labour Minister who was one of the surprises of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Mrs Penicaud, a business school professor, has occupied several managerial positions in the private sector (Dassault, Danone, Orange) but also in public companies (SNCF, Paris Airports).

But thanks to the escalating controversy over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/17/trump-russia-investigation-special-counsel-robert-mueller-fbi\">Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing of FBI director James Comey</a> and even talk of possible impeachment, the mood has changed dramatically.</p> <p>US markets suffered their biggest one day fall since September, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 372 points, while the dollar lost all the gains it made since Trump was elected president. The US currency and stock markets had been boosted by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises of tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but his current problems mean these proposals are on the backburner. And the prospect of a rate rise by the US Federal Reserve next month, almost a given a couple of days ago, now looks more unlikely amid a potential political crisis. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the VIX languishing at multi year lows only a couple of days ago it was perhaps inevitable that the low volatility of the past few weeks would in all likelihood end rather abruptly, with the only unknown being as to what the catalyst might be. </p> <p>As it turns out it was events in Washington DC that delivered investors the kick in their complacency that many had been warning about, as stock markets and the US dollar fell sharply, while safe haven assets like gold surged....</p> <p>Having waited months for evidence that we would eventually see something resembling a reform program and fiscal stimulus to justify the rally in the US dollar and stock markets since November, investors finally lost patience amid a selling frenzy with US markets posting their biggest one day loss since September last year. </p> <p>The big question now is whether this turns out to be the start along a road to an impeachment process or whether this is another bump in the road.</p> </blockquote> <p>The risks to global markets from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes is considerable, given how far they have climbed on the back of his long awaited measures to stimulate the US economy.

Even the Brazilian stocks believed in the reflation story for a moment and added 22% between December and February. Of course, Brazil has got its own problems.

                "bodyText":"As forecast, the continuing controversy over Donald Trump and his actions relating to Russia and the sacking of FBI director James Comey, sent Wall Street lower again as markets opened. But after their worst day since September, the falls have been fairly limited and could easily be reversed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 14 points, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.22% in early trade. Meanwhile European markets remain under pressure, with the FTSE 100 down 1.2%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropping 0.65% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 0.89% lower. Dennis de Jong, managing director UFT.com, said: While the impeachment of Donald Trump may not be a serious possibility at this stage, the mere mention of the word has seen warning lights go off across the world, with doubts over the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to deliver on his planned infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Investors are steering clear of any risky assets due to the uncertainty over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and given the unpredictable nature of the presidency so far, this is unlikely to improve any time soon. With potentially more revelations on Trump yet to surface, global financial uncertainty could be a feature of the next four years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if he lasts that long, that is. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again tomorrow. And nor is Brazil: Ahead of the Wall Street open, and European markets are not looking too healthy: More fallout from the uncertainty surrounding President Trump and his future plans. Copper has fallen 1.8% on concerns that his promised infrastructure spending could be derailed by the current controversy surrounding the president. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Asa Bridle told Reuters: Anything that is industrially oriented has taken a bit of a whack because there are doubts about whether Trump can push through his massive infrastructure spending plans. Back to the US, and despite the current political shenanigans the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data is better than expected. US jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, down by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000. Analysts had forecast a rise to 240,000. The number of Americans receiving unemployment benefit is now at a 28 and a half year low. Meanwhile the Philadelphia business conditions survey for May jumped from 22 in the previous month to 38.8, much higher than the forecast level of 19.5. The US is not the only country which could be heading for political problems: Here is the background: At the ECB meeting, according to the minutes, ECB board member and chief economist Peter Praet warned colleagues to be careful when talking about the future of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy: Mr Praet considered that, at the current juncture, the Governing Council had to be particularly cautious regarding the future evolution of its policy communication. After a prolonged period of exceptional monetary policy accommodation, financial market participants were particularly sensitive to any perceived change in the future course of monetary policy. Any substantial change in communication needed to be motivated by some more evidence that the present indications of acceleration in activity found confirmation in hard data and fed through to a sustainable adjustment in inflation. Looking ahead to the Governing Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7-8 June monetary policy meeting, a new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and a new assessment of the risks to the outlook would become available to inform discussions on the way forward. At last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular meeting the European Central Bank kept its interest rate policy and bond buying programme unchanged, with the eurozone economy improving but the inflation outlook subdued. In the minutes of the meeting just released, the ECB expands on this: While there was broad agreement that the configuration of risks to euro area activity had improved overall, some members considered that the risks to real GDP could now be characterised as broadly balanced, in particular given the improvement in recent data and indicators and the decline in political uncertainty. Other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed and that a change in the risk assessment was premature in view of continued risks and uncertainties, even if diminishing, both globally and in the euro area. There is more detail on the outlook and the risks involved: Members exchanged views on the outlook and risks for the external environment, also taking into account the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, which had been released after the Governing Council meeting in early March, and the related discussions at the IMF spring meetings. It was underlined that the latest data on global activity and trade pointed to stronger global growth momentum and a re-synchronisation of the recovery, between global growth and trade and between advanced and emerging economies. However, the external outlook was considered to be still subject to elevated uncertainty, and the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was assessed to remain on the downside. Among the factors that continued to contribute to this uncertainty were the scope and timing of the future policy choices of the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the European Union, the rebalancing of demand and the transition towards lower growth rates in China, and developments in other emerging market economies. In particular, reference was made in the discussion to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding short-term developments in the US economy, which reflected a significant divergence between hard and soft data for the United States. Moreover, financial market participants and investors were reassessing the outlook for US growth and inflation, as it appeared that US data were no longer exceeding market expectations, and there was still considerable uncertainty surrounding the new US Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, including the prospects for fiscal stimulus, and their likely expansionary effects. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales figures should be treated with a little caution, says economics editor Larry Elliott: Britain went on a spending spree in April. The shops were full of punters. Online retailers coined it in. Spring brought with it an end to the winter consumer spending blues. That at least is what the official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics reported that the volume of retail sales rose by 2.3% last month, smashing City expectations. This, though, is the same Office for National Statistics that said earlier this week that living standards were being squeezed because wages were failing to keep pace with prices. Something doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite add up. His full analysis is here: Future market moves will be balanced between the growing Trump risk and the reasonable economic and corporate data coming out, suggests Nick Brooks,head of economic and investment research at asset manager Intermediate Capital Group: Scepticism about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to follow through on his campaign promises has been growing over time as reflected in the flattening of the US yield curve and weakening of the US dollar since the beginning of the year. Up until the Comey firing, however, most investors in risk assets largely ignored the political noise, preferring to focus on improving economic and earnings data. The most recent events are being taken far more seriously by investors, with recent market movements indicating investors are looking at the latest scandal as potentially representing a death knell for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal agenda. Those investors that have not already capitulated on so-called Trump trades will likely be liquidating those positions sharply. A prolonged wider risk asset sell-off seems unlikely, however, as long as the macro and earnings data continues to hold up. The recovery in the US futures market seems to have gone into reverse: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the UK retail sales, from my colleague Angela Monaghan: Most first quarter GDP figures have now been released, and Germany is leading the way again as it did last year: The pound is holding on to its gains, up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.3027 and 0.8% better against the euro at $1.1712. At its peak so far during the morning, the pound reached $1.3045, which is its highest against the dollar since 29 September last year. But it is still way below the $1.4878 level the day before the Brexit result was announced. The strength of sterling is conversely hitting the FTSE 100 due to its preponderance of overseas earnings, with the leading index now down 100 points or 1.34%. Online sales continue to gain ground, points out Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte: Online sales have been particularly strong over the last few months and April is no different; online retail is up 19% from last year and now accounts for 15.6% of all retail spending. Indeed, UK consumers spent \u00c2\u00a31bn a week online in April. He also suggests - with some reservations - that May might also be a good month for the high street: Looking ahead, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures could benefit from mild, sunny weather coinciding with the two bank holiday weekends, which should be the perfect recipe for further increased footfall. However, May 2016 was a particularly strong month, so it will be interesting to see how the year-on-year comparisons fare, and whether the figures for May 2017 show the first signs of inflation starting to bite. More reaction to the forecast-busting UK retail sales figures, and there are warnings that consumer optimism may not last with the continuing squeeze on real earnings: Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown: Given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that real wages are now falling, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data was always going to be closely scrutinised. The theory went that squeezed household budgets would likely hit retailers in the pocket too. But in fact the figures beat expectations handsomely, with sales in April 2.3% higher than in March and growing 4.0% year-on-year. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were always expected to be better than March, because of the timing of the Easter holiday, but economists had forecast a smaller rebound of 1.0%, and much more subdued annual growth of 2.0%. The ONS says April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warm weather encouraged people to spend on food, home improvements and gardening equipment. The balance of probability suggests that at some point the combination of higher inflation and lacklustre wage growth will take its toll on the UK consumer. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers provide some welcome evidence the economy has made a brighter start to the second quarter following disappointing GDP growth of 0.3% in Q1. With the labour market looking relatively robust, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible the current mood of pessimism is unjustified. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit: April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp rebound in retail sales gives a boost to second quarter GDP growth prospects. It buoys hopes that consumer spending will not hamper UK GDP growth as it clearly did in the first quarter. It is evident that the more than halving of UK GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017 (from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016) was primarily the consequence of previously buoyant consumers reining in their spending as purchasing power was hit hard by inflation and low earnings growth combined. However, April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in retail sales looks unlikely to mark the beginning of a renewed upturn in consumer spending given the sharp and increasing squeeze on purchasing power. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent rebound in retail sales was clearly helped substantially by warm weather lifted sales of outdoor products. There is also the possibility that the later Easter had some beneficial impact although the ONS indicated that the data are seasonally-adjusted to allow for this. The suspicion is that it needs something special like markedly warmer weather to currently get consumers to really loosen their purse strings, given the marked dilution of their purchasing power in recent months. Worryingly for UK growth prospects, the squeeze on consumers looks highly likely tighten further over the coming months as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the pressure reinforced by ongoing muted earnings growth... There is also a strong likelihood that consumer confidence and willingness to buy major items will soften \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it is not only pressurised by weakened purchasing power but also by increasing concerns over the economy and perhaps job security... It is also questionable as to whether the labour market can continue to hold up given the growth slowdown and uncertain outlook (including likely difficult Brexit negotiations with the EU coming increasingly coming to the forefront after the 8 June general election is done and dusted. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: A big rebound in retail sales is likely to prove temporary, as the ongoing squeeze on household incomes starts to weigh more heavily on consumer activity over coming months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data was clearly boosted by warmer weather and a late Easter, which helps retailers sell their summer wares (particularly clothing and household/garden items) in higher volumes, but also at more profitable prices. A rainy, cold early Easter makes the lives of retailers much trickier in this respect. Whilst that is likely to account for much of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% MoM gain in retail sales (ex. auto fuel), we have to remember that these figures are extremely volatile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very likely that there are seasonal adjustment issues, as statisticians struggle to keep pace with ever-changing consumer habits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rise of Black Friday style sales is a good example. To us, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the underlying story, where the squeeze in household incomes is starting to weigh on consumer activity. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in inflation (2.7%) and subdued wage growth (2.1%) means real incomes are now falling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that much of the strength in consumption over the past few months has been driven in no-small-part by higher borrowing and lower savings, which is unlikely to prove sustainable. For that reason, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Bank of England to hike rates before 2019. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of the retail sectors: Sterling could move even higher, according to David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB: The pound is trading higher across the board this morning and the recovery seen in the currency since hitting a multi-decade low in January has been impressive and looks set to continue. The retail sales figure itself was the best since the start of 2016 and will go some way to allay the fears of a slowdown in consumer spending following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp drop in this widely viewed indicator. The release marks a 3rd consecutive day of GBP positive economic data, after both the CPI and unemployment figures surpassed estimates. With short positioning still at elevated levels in the pound there could be more legs to this rally, with little by the way of technical resistance seen until \u00c2\u00a21.32. Analysts had been expecting a recovery in retail sales after the slide in March, partly because of the timing of Easter. But the increase was much bigger than forecast, and the Office of National Statistics said the fine weather last month had also helped boost high street spending. Boom! UK retail sales volumes have beaten expectations by some margin in April, rising by 2.3% compared to a 1.4% fall in March (itself revised up from an initial estimate of a 1.8% decline.) Expectations had been for a rise of around 1%. The news has sent sterling above $1.30 for the first time since last September, on the basis the strong figures suggest the possibility of an earlier than expected interest rate rise from the Bank of England. But the FTSE 100 has fallen further, down 72 points or 0.96%, which is not surprising given that the overseas earners which dominate the leading index benefit from a weaker pound. The sell-off in shares may not last, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct: European markets have opened lower once again as they digest the latest news that Congress is officially investigating the Trump/ Comey claims and demanding that the FBI hand over the Comey memo that states President Trump put pressure on the FBI chief to drop an investigation into his National Security Advisor. But, the selloff may not last as US futures are actually predicting a positive open for US stocks later today. We will be watching the futures markets to see if sentiment towards US markets change, but after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steep sell off, a bit of profit-taking is to be expected. However, this does not mean that the political risks are put to bed, if this crisis continues to escalate then we would expect a further sharp reaction in the markets. Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that he was amazed that investors had become so blas\u00c3\u00a9 about political risk, until it was staring them in the face. If the political genie has escaped from the bottle, then it could be an edgy summer for investors as they remain cautious about the political outlook for the US. We continue to think that the bar to impeachment is high, after all, there are some questionable aspects to Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character (remember the reopening of the Hillary emailgate a few weeks before last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election?), and the Republican Congress may be wary of starting proceedings that could impeach their own President. However, if it does come to this then we would expect to see both the dollar and US stocks slide sharply and in tandem, which would be a clear sign that the political situation in the US had taken a severe turn for the worse. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comment refers to this (\u00c2\u00a3). Earlier, new figures showed France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate dipped slightly in the first quarter. It fell from 10% in the previous quarter to 9.6%, according to the national statistics office. The dip is a bit of good news from new French president Emmanuel Macron and his new government. ING Bank economist Julien Manceaux said: Figures just published by the INSEE show that unemployment went down by 0.4ppt in the first quarter, reaching less than 10% for the first time since 2012. At 9.6%, it certainly remains a challenge for [the] new government. Its members are known since yesterday, a choice that respects a very delicate equilibrium between right and left, men and women, politicians and civil society members. At this stage, the main question is if it will survive the June legislative elections... The [unemployment] trend is yet to be confirmed in coming quarters however, as the unemployed population increased by 41k in the first quarter after having declined by 60k in the second half of 2016. The move was mainly due to the fact that one part of the population under training or subsidised jobs reintegrated the main unemployment statistics as they failed to find a job after this period. This illustrates the weakness of the subsidised system: without a strong recovery in private sector job creation, it can only be a temporary success. These difficulties were illustrated this morning by ILO data showing that the employment rate failed to increase among the active population it remained at 64.7%. Finally, figures released this morning showed in particular that unemployment among the youngest workers (15-24 y.o) remains very high at 21.8%. This is probably the main task of the new Government, in particular for Mrs Penicaud, the new labour Minister who was one of the surprises of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Mrs Penicaud, a business school professor, has occupied several managerial positions in the private sector (Dassault, Danone, Orange) but also in public companies (SNCF, Paris Airports). She is expected to bring a liberal touch to the future labour market reforms, but is already facing a strike in her own ministry this week by the main left-wing union CGT. Royal Mail is also among the leading risers despite a fall in profits and a warning that letter volumes would continue to drop. Annual profits fell 6% to \u00c2\u00a3712m, after the uncertainty over Brexit hit marketing and business mail, while it also continues to face growing competition for parcel delivery from the likes of Amazon. It is also in talks with unions about plans to close its defined benefit pension scheme. Chief executive Moya Greene said the company had come through a challenging period well, and with cost cutting and more efficient investment spending, it would maintain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a progressive dividend policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said: Royal Mail has registered delivery of a solid set of numbers, underpinned by a strong contribution from the overseas unit. The general trend to which the group continues to react is becoming established \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a letters and cards market in terminal decline, offset by the growth in the parcel delivery space as online shopping strengthens its grip on consumer behaviour. Within the numbers, there are a number of promising signs, such as the investment programme having peaked, cost savings still in focus, an improvement to the earnings per share metric and a short-term boost expected by general election mailings. Meanwhile, the dividend yield of 5.2% is extremely attractive in the current environment and remains possible given the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cashflow. Elsewhere, recent moves to alter the pension scheme should provide financial solace further out. Challenges inevitably remain with the current uncertainty within UK PLC as the Brexit negotiations unfold impacting expenditure decisions, whilst the entrance of other large players into the lucrative parcels arena will pile further pressure on trading conditions. In addition, whilst there are some positive signals, progress will need to be maintained since the letters business revenue must be replaced in due course. Even so, the general direction of travel is encouraging. The shares have had a difficult year, dipping 14% over the last 12 months and remaining some way off their highs of over \u00c2\u00a36 in January 2014 following the initial success of the IPO. The company is, nonetheless, focussing on those areas which are particularly troublesome, and the consensus of the shares as a hold may come under review after these results. As expected European markets have slipped back in early trading, following the slump on Wall Street and overnight declines in Asia, on the latest Trump developments. The FTSE 100 has fallen around 45 points or 0.6% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax opened 0.2% lower and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac down 0.1%. Among the risers is Burberry, up 1.7% after the luxury goods group issued a positive outlook statement despite a 21% fall in full year pretax profits stripping out the benefits of the falling pound. The drop was in line with expectations and came after weak demand in the US. Investors were cheered by news the group planned a new \u00c2\u00a3300m buyback to be completed in 2018. Ahead of the UK retail sales, the pound is have a mixed time. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.15% at $1.2950 but it has edged up 0.14% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1635, reversing the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trend. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga said: April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales report... will be vital in providing some insight over the behaviour of consumers amid Brexit developments. With wage growth lagging behind inflation, the sales data may come under scrutiny for any signs of falling wages impacting consumer confidence. If retail sales fail to meet expectations and follow the same pattern as they did in March, concerns are likely to heighten over the sustainability of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer-driven economic growth. Although markets are expecting retail sales to rebound in April to 1% due to the Easter holiday, this still may not be convincing enough to brush away Brexit concerns. The Bank of England has already warned of a consumer spending squeeze while the uncertainty blanketing Brexit continues to weigh on sentiment. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was only a couple of days ago that all the talk was of new stock market peaks and low volatility. But thanks to the escalating controversy over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing of FBI director James Comey and even talk of possible impeachment, the mood has changed dramatically. US markets suffered their biggest one day fall since September, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 372 points, while the dollar lost all the gains it made since Trump was elected president. The US currency and stock markets had been boosted by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises of tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but his current problems mean these proposals are on the backburner. And the prospect of a rate rise by the US Federal Reserve next month, almost a given a couple of days ago, now looks more unlikely amid a potential political crisis. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With the VIX languishing at multi year lows only a couple of days ago it was perhaps inevitable that the low volatility of the past few weeks would in all likelihood end rather abruptly, with the only unknown being as to what the catalyst might be. As it turns out it was events in Washington DC that delivered investors the kick in their complacency that many had been warning about, as stock markets and the US dollar fell sharply, while safe haven assets like gold surged.... Having waited months for evidence that we would eventually see something resembling a reform program and fiscal stimulus to justify the rally in the US dollar and stock markets since November, investors finally lost patience amid a selling frenzy with US markets posting their biggest one day loss since September last year. The big question now is whether this turns out to be the start along a road to an impeachment process or whether this is another bump in the road. The risks to global markets from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes is considerable, given how far they have climbed on the back of his long awaited measures to stimulate the US economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The past six-month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflation rally would face severe reversal risks. If the markets were to retrace the Trump-reflation gains, this would trigger a decent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 squeeze. A quick glance to recent stock price history could give an indication of the risks. The Dow Jones rallied from 17,480 to above 21,100 following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory on November 9 election; this is roughly a 21% rise... Unfortunately, the US stocks are not the only ones concerned. The global Trumpflation virus contaminated the major stock markets across the globe. Since November 9, the German DAX rallied more than 26%, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 gained past 12%, the Japanese Nikkei stepped up to 24%, the Australian ASX 200 soared nearly 18% before the sell-off started at the beginning of May and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE rose by more than 12%. Even the Brazilian stocks believed in the reflation story for a moment and added 22% between December and February. Of course, Brazil has got its own problems. Brazil is plunging back to a bribery crisis concerning its newly elected President Michel Temer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c following the former President Dilma Rousseff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impeachment last year. Overnight the Nikkei followed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead lower, ending down 1.32%, while European markets are also expected to open on the back foot: Meanwhile the fall in the dollar has benefited the pound, but that has disguised a general weakness for the UK currency which has fallen back against the euro. But UK retail sales figures due shortly could well give the pound some support. After a poor month in March, when retail sales fell 1.8%, they are expected to recover some lost ground. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hewson explains: While March was a surprisingly bad month, it could merely been a case of consumers holding back ahead of Easter, as all the indicators seen in recent data from food retailers suggested that shoppers recovered some of their mojo in April. The latest BRC retail sales numbers from last week showed that, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales numbers are expected to show a rise of 1.2%. There are also a host of company results out today - typically for a Thursday. We will be following all the major events of the day.",

For those on the hunt for some good news in the data it was to be found in the investment numbers.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have lagged behind their US counterparts. While New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 hit another record high, most continental bourses ended the day in the red. The FTSE 100 finished a little higher, though, partly due the pound weakening after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor GDP figures. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: UK and European markets have essentially traded in a sideways fashion for most of the week, and today is no exception. While US markets clock up new highs Europe remains becalmed, despite the fact that European data has been much stronger of late than its US counterpart. Across the Atlantic, Amazon and Google find themselves locked in a race for $1000; tech firms continue to leave the old economy far behind, with momentum continuing to drive the sector higher. In a bull market, you buy the strongest performing assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the Nasdaq 100 nearly a fifth higher year-to-date, it is clear that momentum lies here, leaving the staid S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 far behind. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Another former Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, has rushed to visit Lucas Papademos in hospital. Eurocrisis followers may remember that Papandreou was succeeded by Papademos, when his administration was replaced by a government of national unity in late 2011 after seeking its second bailout. The current governor of the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, is visiting his predecessor in hospital now. Stournaras told reporters that the letter bomb attack on Lucas Papademos was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cowardly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Kathimerini newspaper reports. The 4% plunge in the oil price tonight shows that Opec hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to curb crude stockpiles. Nizam Hamid, ETF Strategist in Europe at wealth manager WisdomTree, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited meeting has disappointed investors, with oil prices giving up recent gains after members dashed expectations of deeper cuts to production and merely reiterated the status quo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The falls may provide a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the long-term story for oil, but they also highlight the environment of heightened volatility which the commodity is facing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With supply side dynamics undergoing a fundamental shift thanks to the impact of US shale, only decisive action from Opec will boost prices from current levels, and so far investors have not been satisfied that Opec is tackling the issue aggressively enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for countries who import oil, of course. Car drivers might not see such sharp price rises at the forecourt.... Greek TV are reporting that Lucas Papademos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s injuries are not life-threatening, following this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explosion. The ex-PM has been taken to a hospital in Athens. The oil selloff is accelerating -- Brent crude is now down almost 4.5% at $51.60 per barrel. That shows that the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the plan to extend existing output cuts for another nine months. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says investors are disappointed that Opec didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree deeper production cuts: OPEC members had a chance today but bottled it. A nine-month extension just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to really lift oil prices as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to see US shale fill the gap. Having said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do whatever it takes, OPEC is looking a bit toothless now. Instead of deepening cuts they are continuing to tinker at the margins by curbing production by around 1.8m barrels/day along with several non-OPEC members. It also looks like no new non-OPEC members are joining the curbs, which would have helped. Newsflash from Athens: There are reports that a bomb has gone off inside the car of former Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos. Greek police say that Papademos and his driver have both been injured, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any more details. One report says it was a letter bomb. Papademos, who was also Greek central bank chief and a ECB vice-president, was installed as interim PM in 2011 after Greece signed up for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac130bn bailout. Letter bombs have been sent to several senior figures from the eurozone crisis in recent months, including German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. One exploded at the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Paris in March, injuring a member of staff. Oil prices are on the slide, following the news that Opec and non-Opec members have agreed to extend their production cuts until March 2018. Brent crude is down 2% at $52.82, while New York crude has dropped by 2.7%, below $50 per barrel. Traders may be concluding that the deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t succeed in propping prices up, as US shale producers can boost their own output. Delegates are briefing reporters in Vienna that a nine-month extension has been agreed, by Opec and non-Opec members. That means oil producers will continue to cut 1.8 million barrels per day off their combined output. Energy reporters are racing around the Opec headquarter again, as the official announcement from oil cartel is imminent. Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The technology-focused Nasdaq is also hitting all-time record levels Traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried by the prospect that US interest rates will rise next month. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Traders arrived at their desks this morning having seen the Fed minutes warn of overvaluations in asset prices, and hint at further policy tightening later in the year, and yet were confronted with new record highs in the S&amp;P 500 and the MSCI world index, while the US dollar is under pressure again. What an odd world we live in. Reuters are also reporting that Opec has agreed to curb supply levels for another months: OPEC decided on Thursday to extend cuts in oil output by nine months to March 2018, OPEC delegates said, as the producer group battles a global glut of crude after seeing prices halve and revenues drop sharply in the past three years. The cuts are likely to be shared again by a dozen non-members led by top oil producer Russia, which reduced output in tandem with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries from January. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cuts have helped to push oil back above $50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers, many of which rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets. Newsflash from Vienna: The Opec meeting has finished. The cartel are now being joined by non-Opec countries, to discuss whether they would also support today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rumoured deal to cut supplies for another nine months. Dutch bank ING don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply cuts will work, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry (which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be part of the deal) can boost its own production levels. The latest US trade data is a little disappointing. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has widened, to $67.5bn in April from $65.0bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because exports shrank by 0.9%, with US firms selling fewer cars and consumer goods overseas. Imports rose by 0.7%. That suggests that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may not be rebounding as strongly as hoped from its weak first quarter. But...the latest jobs data is more encouraging. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose by 1,000 last week, to 234,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than the 237,000 which Wall Street had expected, and close to its lowest levels in decades. Back over in Vienna, Opec ministers have been hammering out an agreement to extend their existing production cuts. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official yet, but the word on the ground is that the cartel will keep its current supply cuts for another nine months, through to March 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what investors had largely expected.... ...so the markets have shown their contrary nature, by sending the oil price down a bit. Brent crude is now down 1% at $53.43 per barrel, a whole dollar per barrel less than this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to our old friend \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the news, sell the rumour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some disappointment that Opec didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree deeper cuts. Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sticking to the 1.8m barrel a day deal first agreed in late November extended to March 2018. George Buckley, UK economist at Nomura, is concerned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate is now lagging behind European rivals. He writes: This is the first time in a year that UK growth failed to outpace that of the euro area (on average over the past 3-4 years the UK has grown a couple of tenths per quarter more strongly than the euro area). While UK real GDP is broadly the same as that of Germany relative to where it was at the start of 2008, Germany has produced its 8.5% increase in aggregate output over that period with no change in its population, compared a 6% rise in UK headcount (though the UK has experienced a more sizable rise in its dependency ratio). On a per capita basis, UK GDP did not expand at all in the first quarter of this year (in separate figures also published today official net migration fell to its lowest in three years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 248k in 2016). Housebuilding was a bright spot amidst the gloom spread by the unexpected downward revision to UK GDP today. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 43,170 new houses were started in England between January and March, up 3% on the previous quarter and up 21% on a year earlier. The number of completed houses rose to 39,520, 9% higher than the previous quarter and 21% higher than a year ago. Housing starts totalled 162,880 in the year to March, up 15% on the previous year, while completions rose 6% to 147,960. Andy Frankish of Mortgage Advice Bureau says more is needed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, the latest figures do indicate a marginal increase and we can see the signs of recovery starting in 2013, demonstrating the impact of the introduction of Help To Buy, which could suggest an element of cautious optimism that the industry has perhaps \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcturned the corner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 following the trough of 2009. But if we are to reach the 200,000+ new build homes needed each year in England, there is still more momentum required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even less chance of UK interest rates rising soon, despite inflation surging over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Hill reckons borrowing costs will remain at record lows until early next year. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbackcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has 0.4% q/q in for Q1, so this revised outturn of 0.2% q/q is marginal downside news for policymakers. In our view, this GDP report reinforces the existing case for not responding to above-target inflation. Indeed, we continue to see the risk that the slowdown in activity becomes more entrenched and ultimately results in monetary policy being loosened in Q1 2018. The next government needs to boost investment and drive up wages, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her take on the slowdown in UK growth in the last quarter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very worrying sign of the squeeze that families are feeling. Prices are rising faster than earnings, and households are getting deeper into debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next government will inherit an economy that needs serious attention. An urgent priority must be to reverse the current fall in living standards. The minimum wage must go up faster, and the pay restrictions on public servants like nurses, firefighters and midwives must be ended. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also vital for Britain to increase investment in communities where good jobs are in short supply. More investment is needed in skills, transport links, broadband, decent homes and high quality public services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The TUC has published analysis this morning (Thursday) showing that unsecured debt per UK household will reach a record high this year of \u00c2\u00a313,900. This exceeds the pre-crisis peak of \u00c2\u00a313,300 in 2007. Uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming exit from the European Union may have hit the economy, says ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Knightley: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth downgrade means that Britain was one of the worst-performing advanced economies in the first three months of this year. Only Italy and America did as badly as the UK; they also grew by around 0.2% in Q1 2017. France expanded by 0.3%, Japan managed 0.5%, while Germany posted healthy growth of 0.6% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP surged by 0.8%. The Eurozone and the EU both grew by 0.5%. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data, and discovered that things are even worse than we thought. The UK actually grew by just 0.18% during Q1 (which was rounded up to 0.2%), which is the worst performance in over four years. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, is concerned by the sharp slowdown in UK growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data indicate that the economy slowed even more than previously estimated in the first quarter of 2017, as consumer spending power was squeezed by rising prices. Excluding population growth, real GDP per head - the broadest measure of living standards in the economy - flatlined in the first quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Estimated GDP growth in Q1 2017 was revised down from 0.3% to 0.2% and further detail was released confirming that the slowdown was focused on consumer spending and related industry sectors such as retailing, hotels and restaurants, transport and communications. But he does spot some reasons for optimism- including the rise in business investment, and higher government spending too. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation confirms that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was ZERO in the last quarter, once you adjust for population increases. He also shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth since the financial crisis is rather less impressive on a per-capita basis (ie, growth per person). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report also shows that public sector workers are suffering the biggest impact from rising inflation (which hit 2.7% in April), as their wages are lagging behind the private sector. The ONS says: Compensation of employees, which includes wages and salaries and employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 social contributions, showed positive growth of 0.6% seasonally adjusted in Quarter 1 2017. Non-seasonally adjusted, growth was chiefly driven by strong positive growth in private sector wages and salaries, in turn driven by bonus payments typically made at Quarter 1 and a smaller fall in growth in private sector jobs than seen in previous Quarter 1s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This was partially offset by a small fall in public sector wages and salaries. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how net trade (red) had a negative impact on growth in January-to-March: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from the squeeze on real wages, as inflation overtakes earnings, says Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation. She explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the downward revision may have been unexpected, the reasons behind the weakness surely aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Sluggish household spending growth, a consequence of the squeeze on real incomes starting to kick in, and some pull back on export growth after an impressive end to last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the consumer weakness to persist as wage growth falls further behind rising prices, but there should be some turnaround on the trade front, driven by a brighter outlook in the rest of the world. For those on the hunt for some good news in the data it was to be found in the investment numbers. Business investment picked up at the start of this year and some big revisions to investment at the end of last year mean the investment picture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as dire as first thought. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to see this rebound continue and strengthen if for longer-term productivity prospects to improve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, also blames the rising cost of living: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just as expected higher inflation is squeezing incomes and spending. High inflation is hitting consumers, but a weak pound and a recovering global economy are helping businesses. UK growth is likely to tilt away from the consumer towards exports, manufacturing and investment this year. This should keep the UK economy growing at a similar rate to last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Only one City economist expected Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate to be revised down to 0.2% today, says Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ross Finlay. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, is disappointed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade was so weak last quarter, despite the weak pound: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor flags up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity crisis is even worse than we thought (figures last week showed a fall of 0.5%, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures suggest an even darker picture). But economist Rupert Seggins is encouraged that business investment rose (by 1.2%), despite the Brexit uncertainty. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow at all in the last quarter, if you account for the increase in population. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new figures show that GDP on a per-capita basis was flat in Q1 2017, compared to the final three months of 2016. So while the economy got a bit bigger, individuals didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually feel the benefit. The bad news is that net trade took a big bite out of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate. Net trade wiped 1.4 percentage points off the growth rate, dashing hopes that the weaker pound would be a massive boost to exporters. The ONS says. Within net trade, there has been a rise in total imports, which have contributed negatively to UK GDP, with a notable contribution from transport equipment, machinery and chemicals. And adjusting for inflation, household spending in the first quarter of 2017 rose by just 0.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest amount since the final three months of 2014 -- underlining how inflation is hurting. The good news is that businesses invested more in new plants and machinery at the start of this year. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) increased by 1.2% compared with Quarter 4 2016, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures confirm that UK households were hit by the impact of higher inflation, due to the weak pound. The Office for National Statistics explains: UK GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in Quarter 1 2017 as consumer facing industries such as retail and accommodation fell and household spending slowed. This was partly due to rising prices. Construction and manufacturing also showed little growth, while business services &amp; finance continued to grow strongly. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth in the first quarter of this year was even weake than we thought. Growth has been revised down to just 0.2% for January to March, down from the first estimate of 0.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest growth since the first three month of 2016, and shows that the economy is less robust then we thought. The ONS now believes that the UK service sector grew by just 0.2%, not the 0.3% first expected. Industrial output has been revised down too, from +0.3% to +0.1%. More details and reaction to follow! As expected, Iraq is also backing a nine-month extension: Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister says that a nine-month cuts extension is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly likely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to be agreed today. Khalid al-Falih adds that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any deeper cuts, though. That implies that the current agreement to shave 1.8m barrels-per-day off global outlook would be extended And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! A flurry of comments are hitting the wires as Opec ministers speak to reports. Kuwait\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister says he expects a nine-month extensions to the current output cut deal, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any deeper cuts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snap from inside the Opec meeting, via Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa. No pushing at the back, please. The journalists sent to Vienna to cover today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting are getting hot under the collar, literally. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been queuing, more-or-less patiently, in a stairwell for around an hour - waiting to be allowed into the opening session. These Opec meetings can get quite frenzied, as reporters compete to hear from oil ministers. Last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gathering was particularly heated - several ornaments were broken amid media scrums, and one reporter briefly lost her shoe. Some City analysts are sceptical about whether Opec can really influence the oil price, as many producers - such as America - aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the cartel. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd expect a nine-month extension to the current deal. Many are wondering if the group has any rabbits to pull of its hat to mitigate the risk of a buy the rumour, sell the fact reaction. It is not actually certain that the extension will be 9 months rather than six, even if the noises have been in that direction, or if any other Non-OPEC countries do sign up, they are at best likely to be very marginal producers such as Tajikistan, and per se more an optical addition than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgame changers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Oil ministers are arriving at the Opec HQ now. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live webcast from the hotel here. Three Opec delegates have told Reuters that a nine-month output extension is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most likely scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One says that a one-year extension (to June 2018) is an option. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amanda Cooper has the details: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full agenda of the Opec meeting (timings are in CEST, so knock off an hour for BST). Some background. Last November, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to cut their combined output by around 1.8 million barrels per day through the first six months of this year. That deal did drive the oil price over $50 per barrel, but any hopes (or fears) that prices would push higher have been dashed (or allayed). As this chart shows, the oil price actually dipped back in recent weeks, before rallying on hopes that the deal will be extended today. Queues are forming outside Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in the Austrian capital, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: The oil price is jumping this morning, on predictions that Opec will extend its existing output cuts today. Brent crude has gained almost 1% to $54.45 per barrel, and New York crude is up 0.75% at $51.75 per barrel. That underlines how the markets expect the oil cartel to agree to pump less oil at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has bolstered hopes of a nine-month extension -- and possibly even longer: Barclays analysts have argued that a mere six-month extension would be a blunder, as it would expire at the end of this year - when oil demand is weak. Extending the deal into 2018 would mean that Opec members would ramp up output when demand is strengthening. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Vienna this morning as energy ministers from the Opec oil cartel meet. On the agenda: whether or not to extend the oil production cuts deal which was agreed six months ago. Oil analysts broadly expect an extension to be hammered out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the alternative would spook the markets and send prices spiralling down. But the big issue is how long for. Saudi Arabia (Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest member) is pushing for a nine-month extension, and Iraq backed this plan earlier this week. But there have been whispers that Opec might only extend oil output cuts by a mere six months, or could go the whole hog with a 12 month deal. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all to play for in Vienna today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts that the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will get their way: The oil cartel meets today, and the market is expecting it to extend the period of production cuts by an extra nine months, through to March 2018. This has been widely signalled after Russia (a non-Opec member) and Saudi Arabia said that they would support an extension of the cuts last week. There is a very small chance that some of the smaller, struggling members of Opec, including Venezuela and Nigeria, may resist the prospect of further cuts, overall we think that Saudi Arabia will ultimately get what it wants from this meeting. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Opec should be wary of disappointing the markets: Also coming up today: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to get fresh information on how the British economy performed in the first three months of this year. The second estimate of UK GDP will reveal how business investment, net trade, personal spending and government spending changed over the quarter. The City predict that consumer spending took a dive, as rising inflation hits shoppers. Royal Bank of Canada say: It is expected that a much more modest contribution from the consumer will be behind the lower growth figure, as real household disposable incomes have been hit by rising prices. The Office for National Statistics is also expected to confirm that GDP only rose by a modest 0.3% in January-to-March, down from 0.7% in October-December. 9am BST: Opec opening session begins in Vienna 9.30am BST: Second estimate of UK GDP released 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 4pm BST: Opec press conference We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

                "bodyText":"Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have closed for the night, with the main indices losing ground. The FTSE 100 and German DAX both fell by around 0.25%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC shed 0.5%. Worries over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t faded, despite Alexis Tsipras hitting the phones in an attempt to reach a political solution with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. Bild\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that Greece might simply decline its next bailout loan, triggering a new debt repayment crisis this summer, has alarmed some traders - even though it has been robustly denied by Athens today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone away, with no sign of a serious debt relief deal. Predictions of an early general election in Italy has also given investors some concerns. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Talk that Italy will spice up Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political landscape again with its own snap election is unsettling the idea that Europe is now free of populist risk in 2017. Former Italian Prime Minister Renzi has suggested Italy could hold simultaneous elections with Germany in September. Not to be left out, Greece may opt out of its next bailout if debt relief deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t struck, adding to the potential for market disruption. European assets need the three pillars of stronger economic data, higher political risk in the US and reduced political risk in Europe to outperform. Italy and Greece could are holding the sledgehammer that could knock down one of those three pillars. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is down 0.2% following the drop in US consumer confidence this month. But Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s burst over the $1,000/share mark has pushed the Nasdaq a little higher. Chris Beauchamp of IG says the tech stock boom has further to run. Momentum traders clearly still think that the likes of Facebook and Amazon can go higher, however, with the Nasdaq 100 having gained almost a fifth so far this year. Amazon has surpassed the $1000 mark this afternoon, an event that would mark the top in the market perfectly, but one that probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There seems to be no shortage of investors willing to jump on board this bandwagon. After an early wobble, the pound is higher tonight after a new poll gave Theresa May a 12-point lead ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Traders are also digesting an interesting research note from JP Morgan, which suggests that a hung parliament could actually be good for sterling. Strategist Paul Meggyesi argued that a centre-left coalition could be welcomed by the City, if it would aim for a softer Brexit. As he put it: In the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties (Labour/Lib Dems/SNP) might actually be sterling positive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the US consumer confidence report, from Patrick Chovanec, chief Strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. Just in: US consumer confidence has fallen, raising concerns that the Trump Bump may be fading. The monthly measure of consumer morale, from the Confidence Board, fell to 117.9 from 120.3 in April. The survey found that consumers are less optimistic about future economic prospects, but also a little happier about the current conditions. Analysts at Danske Bank say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that confidence may have peaked: But....Michael Pearce of Capital Economics says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to be worried about\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He points out that consumer confidence is still high by historical standards, suggesting the economy is in decent health. The index is still consistent on past form with consumption growth rising to over 4% annualised in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the current conditions index edged up in May, and is close to a 16-year high. The details of the survey highlight that labour market conditions remain exceptionally tight. The balance of consumers reporting that jobs are easy to find remains high, and is consistent with the unemployment rate falling below 4% in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the net balance expecting their incomes to rise points to wage growth accelerating to around 3% annualised by the end of the year. Amazon has just smashed another stock market landmark, as its surging rally continues. Shares in the e-commerce, web streaming and cloud computing giant have just hit $1,000 for the first time ever. Astonishingly, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have gained around 33% since the start of 2017 -- helping to drive the Nasdaq to a series of record highs. Shares have dipped on Wall Street at the start of trading, as the New York stock market follows Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Energy companies are under some pressure, after Goldman cut its oil price forecasts. It now expects Brent crude to average $55.39 per barrel this year, down from a previous estimate of $56.76/barrel. The Greek prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office is reporting that Alexis Tsipras has hit the phones in calls aimed squarely at putting across Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire for some sort of debt agreement at the next euro group meeting on June 15. The prime minister Alexis Tsipras spoke yesterday with the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron, and just a little while earlier he had a telephone discussion with European Council president Donald Tusk. A statement released from Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office says: The prime minister conveyed the position of the Greek side of the need for a clear solution to the issue of Greek debt and everyone agreed they would continue to work ahead of the euro group on 15 June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When the going has got tough, Tsipras has often tried in the past to bypass creditor institutions by seeking a political solution at prime ministerial level ..... Newsflash: US house prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost three years. Prices across 20 key US cities jumped by 5.9% year-on-year in March, with low supply helping to keep prices buoyant. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller index, which also found that overall prices rose by 5.8%. Associated Press adds: Home values are increasing at more than double the pace of average hourly earnings, making it more difficult for many people to afford to buy a home. A steady job market has bulked up demand among many would-be buyers, but there are fewer properties on the market. Sales listings have plummeted 9 percent over the past year to 1.93 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Back in Athens, a government official has told my colleague Helena Smith that Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is not threatening anyone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over its bailout deadlock. He reiterated Euclid Tsakalotos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no risk of default and please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it seem as if there is one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone is talking about Greece and so we felt that it was necessary to talk ourselves,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the official added, referring to the Greek finance minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to speak directly to foreign correspondents on Monday. Tsakalotos also told the Guardian on the sidelines of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hastily arranged press conference that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we want to tell our side of the story.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if Greece could possibly reject the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn bailout loans due to be released, Tsakalotos insisted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd expected the disbursement to be a problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is already on a path ... it is already moving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the Oxford educated economist had also said he did not want \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to go into the tactics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftist led government might pursue..... We have good news for German shoppers -- inflation in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy has hit a five month low. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Consumer Price Index rose by just 1.4% in May, sharply down from 2.0% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bigger fall than expected, and means the cost of living is rising by less than the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just below 2%. This takes some of the pressure off the ECB to start unwinding its stimulus programme, says ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan points out that German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is enjoying a purple patch, with unemployment low and inflation so modest. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has hit back at claims that Athens might waive its next bailout payment, a move which would trigger a new summer debt crisis. Euclid Tsakalotos told Reuters that Bild, the German tabloid, had misinterpreted his call on Monday for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to reach a deal next month or risk a new economic crisis. Tsakalotos insisted that Athens is not considering waiving the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn loan which is due....over once all sides are happy about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic reforms, and have agreed a debt relief strategy. But Tsakalotos also stuck to his guns on debt relief, saying his government can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support a deal that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tackle this issue. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bild has distorted what I said yesterday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I did say is that the disbursement (of bailout money) was not an issue, because all sides agreed that we have kept to our commitment. But the Greek government feels that a disbursement without clarity on debt is not enough to turn the Greek economy around.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the roundabout world of Greek bailouts, Athens needs to persuade its creditors to hand over this \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn aid tranche in June, so that it can hand it straight back to its lenders in July when various bonds mature. So if it were to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this loan, it would find itself in a very sticky situation this summer.... The threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coalition of chaos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been a major factor in Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election campaign, as she urges voters to trust her to negotiate Brexit. But JP Morgan have argued that a centre-left alliance could actually be positive for the pound, if it steered Britain towards a softer exit from the EU. In a new research note, strategist Paul Meggyesi estimates that there is an 86% chance of a Tory majority, despite the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost continuous decline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead over Labour since the election was called. Meggyesi also believes that sterling wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily crash if May suffered a shock rejection at the ballot box. Instead, the pound could actually rally if Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron and Nicola Sturgeon hammered out a coalition. Meggyesi says: A hung parliament would in more normal circumstances be viewed as quite negative for the British pound [GBP] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was very much the experience of the 2015 election when GBP was braced for one of a myriad of potential coalition permutations only for GBP to jump by 3% once David Cameron secured an improbable narrow majority. But in the post-referendum world, all political developments need to be viewed through a Brexit prism and an argument can be made that a hung parliament which delivered or held out the prospect of a softer-Brexit coalition of the left-of-centre parties (Labour/Lib Dems/SNP) might actually be GBP positive. FX investors might not exactly embrace various aspects of the Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic policy agenda (the renationalisation of certain sectors, a large fiscal expansion), but they could potentially live with these as the price of a less disruptive Brexit under a government that was more willing to preserve the status quo on free movement of labour and trade (the Lib Dems have also committed to holding a second referendum on the final terms of a Brexit deal) Eurozone economic confidence remains close to its highest level since the financial crisis, new figures show, despite a dip this month. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone economic sentiment index fell to 109.2 in May, down from 109.7 in April, dragged down by a drop in service sector confidence Economists had expected it to rise to a new 10-year high of 110. But more encouragingly, confidence within the manufacturing industry rose, from 2.6 to 2.8. Investors are blaming Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, for the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness this morning. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish appearance before the European Parliament yesterday are dragging on the single currency, despite the better economic news from France today. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, cites Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to unwind the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme: The euro has seen a difficult start to the week as it was hurt by fears over Greek debt, the prospect of an early Italian election and comments from ECB President Mario Draghi suggesting continued monetary support for the Eurozone. It is Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments in particular that have led the currency to slip, as increasing signs of economic recovery including positive data releases have led to analysts hoping that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish policies may be narrowed down. After Macron helped the shared currency to rally, investors would have been hoping for the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good fortunes to continue. Just as it is with the pound, political uncertainty has made the euro volatile, and analysts will be hoping that more stability lies ahead for the euro as events continue to develop.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had a disappointing start to this year, new GDP figures show. The Swedish economy grew by 0.4% in January-March, down from 0.7% in Q4 2016, and only half as fast as expected. More here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat French economic data: New inflation figures how that consumer prices across Germany rose at a slower rate this month: We get the overall German inflation report at 1pm BST. And a low reading will strengthen the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination not to end its monetary stimulus programme too soon. European stock markets have fallen in early trading, putting them on track for their fourth day of losses. Worries over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, a possible early Italian general election, and Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious comments about the eurozone recovery are all weighing on shares. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE has lost 0.5%, partly thanks to IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% slide. Mining stocks and banks are also losing ground: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE was one of the worst performers after the bell, plunging more than half a percent to lurk just above 7500. A 1% drop from copper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the metal is now at its worst price in a week and a half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c weighed on the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining stocks, while the ongoing British Airway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaos is hurting its parent IAG, which fell 3.5% as the session got underway. The UK banks were also all in the red, taking their cue from their Italian counterparts, which plunged on early election fears. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has wiped around \u00c2\u00a3500m off IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation. Shares in British Airways\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 parent company have slumped to the bottom of the London stock market this morning, after a long weekend of disruption. International Airlines Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell by 4% at the start of trading, as investors try to calculate the cost of the IT problems that disrupted hundred of flights. BA cancelled all its flights from Heathrow and Gatwick (London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest airports) on Saturday, and there were further delays on Sunday as the airline battled to recover the situation. Experts reckon the compensation bill could hit \u00c2\u00a3100m, but the long-term impact of the crisis is hard to assess. BA blamed a power supply outage, and denied that a cyberattack was to blame. But unions pointed out that BA has made hundreds of IT staff redundant recently. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, believes BA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation could be significantly damaged by the crisis: Even if you give BA the benefit of the doubt it still looks bad, if their systems are not strong enough to withstand a power surge, then this sort of thing could happen again, which could add downward pressure to the IAG stock price. Although cost cutting has been good for the share price in the last year, it will come back to bite IAG if it stops them from doing what they are supposed to do: fly passengers to their destinations. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has scrambled to deny Bilt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that it might default on its next debt repayment in July. Reuters has the details: A Greek government spokesman denied a German newspaper report on Tuesday that it was considering opting out of a loan repayment in July if lenders could not agree on debt relief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not true,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told Reuters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a solution on June 15.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing faster than first estimated. Statistics body INSEE has reported that French GDP expanded by 0.4% in January-March, up from the 0.3% first estimated. That means France grew twice as fast as the UK in the first three months of this year. And in another boost for new president Emmanuel Macron, French consumer confidence is now rising at its fastest rate in a decade. INSEE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of consumer morale has jumped to 102 in May, up from 100 in April, wth households saying they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more optimistic about the economic situation. Growing concerns over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme are weighing on the euro this morning. The European single currency has shed almost 0.5% to $1.113, on concerns that Athens and its creditors may not reach an agreement over its bailout programme in time. Overnight, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos warned that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delicate recovery would be derailed if eurozone finance ministers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to release its next loan in June. Tsakalotos told journalists in Athens that Greece deserves to be given the debt relief promised by its lenders, if it stuck to its austerity programme. He said it is now vital that a real is reached on June 15, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept a deal which is not what was on the table. What was on the table was if Greece carried out its reform package then creditors would ensure that there would be a clear runway through clarity for debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece had hoped to receive its latest bailout payment this month, but eurozone ministers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Athens faces \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of debt repayments this summer, so there is concern that the eurozone debt crisis could flare up again soon. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bilt newspaper is claiming this morning that it might \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcskip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 its next bailout payment, if a deal on debt relief hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been reached. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added to the anxiety this morning: The euro is also suffering from worries over Italy, where former prime minister Matteo Renzi is pushing for early elections - perhaps in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is dipping in early trading today as anxiety over next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election continues to build. Sterling is down 0.2% this morning at $1.281, after a new opinion poll showed that the Conservatives have a lead of just six percentage points over Labour. After a similarly tight YouGov poll last week, City investors are less confident Last night, prime minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both faced off against veteran political journalist Jeremy Paxman. Both sides are (predictably) claiming victory, after a robust (but not desperately enlightening) encounter that saw Corbyn deny being a dictator, and May accused of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The London stock market is expected to drop a little when trading resumes after the Bank Holiday weekend, having hit a record high on Friday night. We also get a raft of new eurozone economic data this morning, that may show if the European recovery is on track. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 7.45am: The second estimate of French GDP for Q1 2017 is released. 10am: Eurozone economic confidence figures for May are published; economists expect another strong reading 1pm: German inflation figures for May are published, and may show that the CPI rate fell to 1.6%, from 2% in April 2pm: The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index of US house prices is released 3pm: US consumer confidence figures for May",
