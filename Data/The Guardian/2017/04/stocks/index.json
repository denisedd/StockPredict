                "bodyText":"It\u2019s official, America\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed last month. The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) just released its own report, and like Markit\u2019s rival data it shows that the growth rate dipped. The ISM\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to 57.2 in March, down from 57.7 in February. That\u2019s still a decent-enough result, comfortably over the 50-point mark that divides rising and falling activity level, and a little higher than expected. Here are the key points, via Bloomberg: ISM\u2019s production gauge cooled to a four-month low of 57.6 from 62.9, which was the best reading since March 2011 Gauge of supplier deliveries rose to 55.9 in March, the highest since December 2014, from 54.8 Measure of order backlogs climbed to 57.5, the best reading in three years, from 57 Customer inventories gauge fell to 47, matching the second-lowest since July 2015, from 47.5 That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The first of two healthchecks on America\u2019s factory sector just arrived, and it\u2019s a little disappointing. Markit\u2019s monthly US manufacturing PMI has fallen by nearly one whole point, from 54.2 to 53.3. That\u2019s the lowest reading since September 2016, signalling that growth has hit a six-month low. US manufacturers reported that new orders and output growth had slowed, meaning they also hired fewer new staff than earlier this year. And again, there are signs that raw materials are getting more expensive... Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief business economist, is warning that the US economy may be weakening: \u201cThe post-election resurgence of the manufacturing sector seen late last year is showing signs of losing steam. Output growth slowed to a six-month low in March, optimism about the outlook has waned and hiring has slowed accordingly. \u201cWhile the survey data suggest that the goods producing sector enjoyed a relatively good first quarter on the whole, the loss of momentum seen in February and March bodes ill for the second quarter. Newsflash: Another UK company is facing a takeover offer from an overseas rival. This time it\u2019s WS Atkins, the engineering, design, planning, and architectural design firm based in Epsom, Surrey. It has received a takeover offer from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., a Montreal-based engineering services company. The approach values Atkins at \u00a320.80 per share, a 35% premium to Friday night\u2019s close. Atkins told the City that: The Board of Atkins has indicated to SNC-Lavalin that the Possible Offer would deliver value to Atkins shareholders at a level that the Board would be prepared to recommend, subject to reaching agreement on the other terms and conditions of the offer. Atkins and SNC-Lavalin are in discussions about the other terms and conditions of the Possible Offer which is conditional on, amongst other things, diligence and financing. Shares in Atkins have soared by almost 30% to \u00a319.95, suggesting that City expects the deal to sail through. It\u2019s been a rather subdued morning in the City, with sentiment dampened by the slowdown in UK factory output growth. The FTSE 100 never really got moving, and is currently up just 1 points (0.02%). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, says investors are edgy as they wait for the leaders of America and China to meet later this week. Market direction remains indecisive, given the huge number of economic and political issues at hand.... The FTSE has started the week in somewhat indecisive fashion, with initial gains promptly erased ahead of a big week for the markets. Fashion firm Burberry is outperforming the market, up 1% after signing a deal to license its fragrances and cosmetics brands to US beauty firm Coty. The pound has lost half a eurocent against the euro today to \u20ac1.173, as well as half a cent against the US dollar. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, explains why: \u201cAfter sustaining an upward trend last week, the pound has fallen as the release of UK manufacturing figures showed signs of a slowdown. For the first time in several days, the pound showed signs of weakness against the euro and the dollar on the back of disappointing manufacturing figures for March \u2013 in marked contrast to the robust figures seen in Eurozone. These weaker figures suggest that after months of good export levels, the inflationary effects of Brexit and the falling demand for consumer goods could be making it difficult to sustain the same levels of growth. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that UK firms are having to cope with sharply rising input costs - as raw materials become steadily pricier. That\u2019s partly due to the depreciation in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains that firms are now passing those costs on. The reduced buying power of the Pound has led to the 11th consecutive rise in input costs with consumers feeling the effects in the form of higher prices on the high street. There are also signs that supply chains are struggling, with companies reporting longer waits for their own orders to be delivered. Brocks comments: Supplier delivery times have also begun to lag, clogging up the supply chains of British manufacturing. With the rate of new order growth showing early signs of easing in March, manufacturers must act to ensure they are not locked into costly contracts. Now is not the time for manufacturers to rest on their laurels. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the French presidential elections will determine whether Europe\u2019s recent recovery continues: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic growth looks to be robust with factory output growth hitting the fastest rate since April 2011. Germany and Netherlands within the euro-core continued to show strong growth but Greece deteriorated further during March. The surprising element has been UK\u2019s manufacturing, which has indicated a slowdown despite boost of the weaker pound after Brexit. As we now enter the second quarter of the year, the key event in Europe will be the French presidential election. While Eurosceptic Marine le Pen is expected to win in the first round and lose in the second round run-off , it is worth remembering opinion polls have proved fallible in predicting the strength of populist sentiment in the case of Brexit and the Trump victory. A Le Pen victory would be huge challenge for the ECB as it would be required to give massive support to the Euro and to French bonds and banks as they would come under severe market pressure.\u201d Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal points out that the eurozone jobless rate is now below its average level, thanks to today\u2019s fall: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons Europe\u2019s labour market is benefiting from \u201crecent solid Eurozone growth and healthy business confidence\u201d. However.... With still appreciable slack in labour markets in most Eurozone countries, wage growth looks most likely to pick up only gradually. It\u2019s a record-breaking day in India, where the stock market has closed at its highest ever level. Traders were encouraged by today\u2019s manufacturing data, which showing growth picking up. Marianne Thyssen, the European Commissioner for Employment, tweets that European leaders need to keep pushing to bring unemployment down: We have further good news for the Eurozone this morning, on top of the strong factory data. Unemployment across the region has fallen to its lowest level in almost eight years, in another sign that its economic recovery continues. The eurozone jobless rate fell to 9.5% in February, statistics body Eurostat reports, down from 9.6% in January. That\u2019s the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. Unemployment in the wider European Union also fell in February, to 8.0% from 8.1%. Twenty six EU members reported lower unemployment than a year ago, but the jobless rate did rise in Denmark and Lithuania. However, the figures also highlights the sharp differences across Europe. The lowest jobless rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (3.4%), Germany (3.9%) and Malta (4.1%). But in Greece, the jobless rate remains over 23%, and in Spain it is 18.0% (They mean February 2017, of course) Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, isn\u2019t too concerned by the slowdown in UK factory growth last month. \u201cAlthough March saw an easing in output, manufacturing\u2019s solid start to the year continues with healthy order books and exporters continuing to capitalise on sterling\u2019s weakness. However, with inflation looming large, manufacturers should be increasingly conscious of the potential softening of UK domestic demand, which has been fuelling growth for some time.\u201d Apologies, we\u2019re having some technical problems with images this morning. It\u2019s being looked into; in the meantime, here\u2019s the UK manufacturing PMI (in case you can\u2019t see it in the 9.42pm post) The pound has been hit by the news that UK factory growth slowed last month. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, at $1.2498. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, suspects that UK factories will suffer from slowing consumer demand this year: \u201cToday\u2019s data certainly doesn\u2019t set off any alarm bells but it does signal that the consumer, one of the big props of UK growth in recent years, is already under the cosh and if there is any loss of momentum in the global economy, these strong manufacturing indicators could falter.\u201d Newsflash! Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed in March, dashing hopes that growth would pick up. The UK manufacturing PMI has fallen to 54.2, the lowest reading in four months, according to data firm Markit. That\u2019s down from 54.5 in February, and rather weaker than the 55.0 which some City forecasters had expected. [reminder: Any reading over 50 shows growth] Markit reports that output and new order growth both slowed last month, suggesting that the British economy may be cooling. Consumer goods producers suffered the sharpest slowdown, with growth little higher than in February. Firms also reported another rise in input costs, as inflationary pressures hit the sector again. More encouragingly, they did also keep hiring staff. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector seems to be slowing down: \u201cThe survey data suggest that the goods-producing sector made a solid contribution to GDP during the opening quarter of 2017. However, it\u2019s clear that the expansion will be less than the buoyant 1.3% rise seen in the fourth quarter of last year. \u201cWith growth losing further momentum in March, that weaker trend is likely to continue into the second quarter. The latest survey also clearly shows that high costs and weak wage growth are sapping the strength of consumers, with rates of expansion in output and new orders for these products slowing further. Markit has also warned that Greece\u2019s manufacturing downturn continued last month: Operating conditions in the Greek manufacturing sector deteriorated further during March. The downturn was driven by another sharp decrease in new orders, which in turn contributed to a further drop in output. As a result of lower production requirements, firms reduced their staffing numbers and input buying. Boom! Europe\u2019s economic recovery continued last month, with factory growth hitting its fastest rate since April 2011. Data firm Markit reports that growth rates for production and new orders accelerated to near six-year highs in March. Companies reported a surge of orders from domestic and export clients, leading to faster job creation. This drove the overall eurozone manufacturing PMI up to 56.2 in March, up from 55.4 in February, showing the fastest growth in 71 months. The pace of the recovery is now causing new problems, with some firms reporting that their suppliers are struggling to meet demand. Germany and the Netherlands led the way with particularly robust growth. But Greece missed out again, suffering another contraction. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurozone manufacturing is clearly enjoying a sweet spell as we move into spring, but it is also suffering growing pains in the form of supply delays and rising costs. \u201cAll key business activity gauges \u2013 output, new order inflows, exports, backlogs of work and employment \u2013 are close to six-year highs. \u201cHowever, the survey is also signalling the highest incidence of supplier delivery delays for nearly six years, underscoring how suppliers are struggling to meet surging demand. \u201cThese delays send a warning signal about rising inflationary pressures, as busy suppliers are often able to hike prices. Prices charged for goods leaving the factory gate are consequently rising at the fastest rate since mid-2011, despite March seeing a drop in the price of oil and a stronger euro against the US dollar, as supplier price hikes are passed on to customers. \u201cThe upturn is broad-based with one exception. Greece is suffering an increased rate of contraction of its manufacturing economy, with exports dropping sharply again in March.\u201d German factory growth has hit its highest level in almost six years, thanks to a rise in exports. Markit says: Output increased at the fastest rate in over three years, driven by the strongest gain in new orders in nearly six years. Moreover, new export orders grew at the strongest pace since May 2010. This led to the sharpest rise in employment in over five-and-a-half years. France\u2019s manufacturing sector also had a good March, today\u2019s data shows. New orders surged, sending the French factory PMI up to 53.3 from 52.3 in February. Good news from Italy! The country\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its fastest jump in activity since March 2011. Italian factory bosses reported a \u201csharp and accelerated growth\u201d last month, with production rates picking up, new orders rising, and higher exports too. Data firm Markit also found that job creation accelerated, saying A record rise in backlogs of work meanwhile contributed to a further pick-up in factory job creation, while goods producers also raised their input buying levels. Encouragingly, manufacturers also showed plenty of optimism towards growth prospects in the coming year too. The first eurozone manufacturing data has arrived..... and it shows that Spain\u2019s factory sector slowed last month. The Spanish manufacturing PMI fell to 53.9 in March, the lowest reading since October, down from 54.8 in February. That\u2019s still comfortably over the 50-point that separates expansion from contraction, though, and firms said they were still optimistic about future prospects. Sanish firms also reported that the cost of raw materials continued to climb. Markit, which compiles the report, says: The rate of input cost inflation quickened to the fastest in nearly six years during March, having accelerated for the seventh month running. Among the items reported as being up in price were cotton, paper, plastics, steel, fuel and other oil-related products. Wowzers. Shares in UK chip designer Imagination Technologies have plunged by over 60% this morning, after it shocked the City by revealing that Apple will no longer use its intellectual property in its new products. Apple are Imagination\u2019s largest customer, and provide around half its revenue by using its intellectual property in iPhones, iPads, and iPods under a licensing agreement. All that will change in two years, though, Imagination revealed this morning in a rather terse announcement. Imagination also hinted at legal battles ahead, claiming it will be \u201cextremely challenging\u201d for Apple to design new chip architecture without infringing its intellectual property rights..... Germany\u2019s stock market is heading to a fresh record high in early trading, as Frankfurt traders start the week in good form. The DAX is leading Europe\u2019s stock markets higher in early trading, and has jumped over its previous record close in 2015. There\u2019s a more muted feeling in London where the FTSE 100 is pretty flat. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: April hits the ground running this Monday, with the markets kicking off the second quarter with a glimpse at Q1\u2019s final manufacturing PMIs. Turkey\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its fastest growth in three years. Today\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index report shows that firms took on more staff last month, to handle a pick-up in new orders. We\u2019ve already seen some encouraging manufacturing reports from Asia today, including a strong pick-up in India and steady growth in Japan. Reuters has the details: Factories across much of Asia posted another month of solid growth in March, rounding off a strong quarter for the world\u2019s manufacturers, even as exporters fear a rise in U.S. protectionism could snuff out a global trade recovery. China again led the way, with an official manufacturing index expanding at the fastest pace in nearly five years, while factory surveys on Monday showed encouraging growth as well in Japan, India and much of emerging Asia. Higher commodities prices have helped boost the value of exports, along with a global thirst for electronic gadgets, but many countries are reporting stronger sales volumes as well, even as the new Trump administration starts to flex its muscles on trade. \u201cAsia\u2019s economic backdrop remains solid with most countries remaining above the key threshold level of expansion, though U.S. trade protectionism fears is the biggest uncertainty for now,\u201d said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers in Hong Kong. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means a new flurry of reports on the world\u2019s manufacturing sector. At 9.30am we find out how Britain\u2019s factories fared in March. Economists predict another month of solid activity, with the weak pound providing a cushion to Brexit uncertainty. The consensus is that the UK manufacturing PMI will rise to around 55.1, up from 54.6 in February. That would signal faster growth, and a pretty strong start to 2017. Before that, we get figures from across the eurozone. And again, economists expect some decent figures, which would indicate that Europe\u2019s recovery is continuing to pick up. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has rounded up the predictions: We get to see the latest numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany, all four of which have shown a steady improvement since the beginning of the year, and which are expected to come in at 54.6, 55.2, 53.4 and 58.3 respectively, helped in no small part by the weaker euro. Any reading over 50 points shows growth, so these reports could drive Germany\u2019s stock market to a new record high: Then at 10am, we get the latest eurozone unemployment figures. Economists reckon the jobless rate could fall to 9.5% in February, which would be its lowest since 2009! Investors will also be thinking about geopolitics, where the situation looks rather tense. Donald Trump will be entertaining Chinese leader Xi-Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago golf course in Florida later this week, and there could be fireworks if the president brings up issues like currency manipulation and globalisation. And then there\u2019s Brexit, where the UK government is now vigorously defending Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty. Four days after Article 50 was triggered, the first comparisons with the Falklands Islands have begun....",

And in some ways their role is even more important in the euro area than in other parts of the world. </p> <p>Though electronic payments are becoming more popular, cash is still our most important means of payment. A soon-to-be-published survey on cash use, carried out on behalf of the ECB, shows that over three-quarters of all payments at points-of-sale in the euro area are made in cash. In terms of transaction values, that\u2019s slightly more than half. So even in this digital age, cash remains essential in our economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>After hailing the new note\u2019s security features making it harder to counterfeit, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But there is also another reason why banknotes are a fundamental part of what we do \u2013 one which is more significant for the euro area than for others.

Brooks says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this election is as wide open as the polls suggest, then Fillon, with his solid block of conservative voters, could still be in the game.</p> <p> We expect Fillon to give his all in tonight\u2019s debate, and he is likely to come out fighting as this is his last chance to use a public debate to boost his popularity. This might give him a slight advantage above the supposedly safer candidates Macron and Le Pen....</p> <p>If tonight\u2019s debate sees Fillon perform well then the foreign exchange market could start to price out the chance of a Le Pen victory in the first round, which we believe is one of the reasons why the euro has been under pressure and the French-German yield spread has widened again in the last week or so. A strong Fillon performance could see the euro rally in anticipation of a Macron/ Fillon second round...</p> <p> Overall, there is a chance that the market has been wrong-footed by the polls, and Le Pen is not guaranteed a spot in the second round. If we are correct, then the political premium that has weighed on the euro in recent months could evaporate, allowing the single currency to stage a decent rally as we move into the second quarter.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfdfe9a0ec84a9d33c96eb7787a0f1127912be13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfdfe9a0ec84a9d33c96eb7787a0f1127912be13/176_0_4262_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Socialist candidate for the presidential election Benoit Hamon, centre, greets from left to right, Francois Fillon, Emmanuel Macron, far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, and Marine Le Pen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socialist candidate for the presidential election Benoit Hamon, centre, greets from left to right, Francois Fillon, Emmanuel Macron, far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, and Marine Le Pen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e39418e4b007e8557f29b5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-04T12:58:38.956Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US trade gap narrows as exports surge</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42587c02cad0cdb5cbbf82e55d5b18066bf90114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42587c02cad0cdb5cbbf82e55d5b18066bf90114/0_0_4368_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Port of Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Port of Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Now this might please Donald Trump - America\u2019s trade gap has hit a four-month low, as exports rise and imports fall.</strong></p> <p>The US trade deficit shank by 9.6% to $43.6bn in February, the US Commerce Department reports, down from $48.2bn in January.

                "bodyText":"With the rise in crude prices helping to lift energy stocks, European shares have ended the day in positive territory. A recovery on Wall Street after an early decline has also helped sentiment, although concerns about President Trump\u2019s ability to push through his tax and spending programmes continue to unsettle investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.13 points or 0.54% at 7321.82 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.21% to 12,282.34 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.3% to 5101.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.07% to 20,257.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.35% higher at 10,361.2 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.13% to 666.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 40 points or 0.2%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile here\u2019s JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon talking about the consequences of Brexit in his annual letter to shareholders: Oil prices are moving higher on the expectation of a drop in US oil stocks. Brent crude is up 1.6% at $53.99 ahead of the latest US inventory figures, helped by hopes that Opec and other producers would continue to curtail output, despite the effects of this move being offset by rising US shale production. But with demand picking up, analysts expect US crude stocks to show a decline last week after two weeks of increases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to hover in negative territory as investors remain cautious. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Neither a shrinking trade deficit nor a solid factory orders figure could convince the Dow Jones to open in the green this Tuesday.... The next few days are pretty busy for the US, with a pair of services PMIs on Wednesday, the meeting between Trump and China\u2019s President Xi on Thursday and a non-farm Friday; hopefully one of these events will give the Dow a much-needed kick in the backside. More US data, this time showing the third monthly rise in a row for factory goods orders. New orders rose by 1% in February, in line with expectations but down on the 1.5% increase in January. The January figure was revised up from the initial 1.2% rise. Orders were up 4.6% compared to the same time last year. As European markets edge higher, Wall Street is heading in the opposite direction, albeit marginally. The continuing concerns about whether President Trump will be able to meet his promises on tax and infrastructure spending are putting a dampener on investor enthusiasm. On top of that comes Trump\u2019s potentially tricky meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping later this week. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped around 8 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.25 lower. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has issued a paean of praise for the humble banknote, as he launched the new \u20ac50 note in Frankfurt. He said: Although banknotes may not receive as much attention as other aspects of our monetary policy, they are a fundamental part of what we do. And in some ways their role is even more important in the euro area than in other parts of the world. Though electronic payments are becoming more popular, cash is still our most important means of payment. A soon-to-be-published survey on cash use, carried out on behalf of the ECB, shows that over three-quarters of all payments at points-of-sale in the euro area are made in cash. In terms of transaction values, that\u2019s slightly more than half. So even in this digital age, cash remains essential in our economy. After hailing the new note\u2019s security features making it harder to counterfeit, he went on: But there is also another reason why banknotes are a fundamental part of what we do \u2013 one which is more significant for the euro area than for others. In a multi-country union such as ours, it is inevitably harder to create a shared identity than in a single nation state with its own culture and history. The euro is something we all have in common \u2013 it is a tangible symbol of European unity. Back in Europe, and later comes the second debate in the French presidential election, whose outcome is likely to impact the euro. As Kathleen Brooks at City Index points out, some candidates are not attending the final debate on 20 April on the basis that it is too close to the election so tonight\u2019s performances could be key. The polls are suggesting that centrist Emmanuel Macron and far right candidate Marine Le Pen are favourites to make it to the second round, but centre-right candidate Francois Fillon should not be ruled out yet. Brooks says: If this election is as wide open as the polls suggest, then Fillon, with his solid block of conservative voters, could still be in the game. We expect Fillon to give his all in tonight\u2019s debate, and he is likely to come out fighting as this is his last chance to use a public debate to boost his popularity. This might give him a slight advantage above the supposedly safer candidates Macron and Le Pen.... If tonight\u2019s debate sees Fillon perform well then the foreign exchange market could start to price out the chance of a Le Pen victory in the first round, which we believe is one of the reasons why the euro has been under pressure and the French-German yield spread has widened again in the last week or so. A strong Fillon performance could see the euro rally in anticipation of a Macron/ Fillon second round... Overall, there is a chance that the market has been wrong-footed by the polls, and Le Pen is not guaranteed a spot in the second round. If we are correct, then the political premium that has weighed on the euro in recent months could evaporate, allowing the single currency to stage a decent rally as we move into the second quarter. Now this might please Donald Trump - America\u2019s trade gap has hit a four-month low, as exports rise and imports fall. The US trade deficit shank by 9.6% to $43.6bn in February, the US Commerce Department reports, down from $48.2bn in January. That\u2019s lower than expected. Exports rose by 0.2% during the month to $192.2bn, the highest since December 2014. Exports to the European Union jumped by 8%, including a 17.3% surge to the UK and an 8.6% rise to Germany. But America bought less from the rest of the world, with imports dropping by 1.8% to $236.4bn. Imports from China shrank by 20%, or $8.6bn, to $32.8bn. That\u2019s due to the Chinese New Year, which usually distorts economic activity in January and February as firms try to ship orders before the Lunar holiday. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics explains: The trade deficit narrowed sharply in February to $43.6bn, from $48.2bn, as the surge in imports from China ahead of the Lunar New Year Holiday was reversed..... After surging from $27.8bn in December to $32.5bn in January, the bilateral deficit with China shrank back to only $23.0bn.... Unsurprisingly since it is a China made distortion, the surge and subsequent drop back in total imports was concentrated in consumer goods. Something to ponder ahead of the Trump-Xi summit later this week.... The slowdown in UK construction sector growth last month has dampened the mood in the City a little. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, reports: The latest PMI data points to a weaker outlook for construction activity in the UK, primarily driven by a loss of momentum in housing activity. This has sent shares in the sector down, led by a 1.5% fall at Travis Perkins, who just last month said it is bracing itself for tougher times this year. Back in the markets, gold has been pushed to a one-week high by geopolitical concerns. Spot gold has gained 0.6% to $1.260 per ounce; a sign that some investors have been seeking out safe-havens for their money. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga suggests the npredictability of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is a key factor, ahead of the meeting with Chinese premier Xi on Friday. The source behind this wave of risk aversion is the uncertainty gravitating around the pending Trump-Xi summit which investors will be paying heavy attention towards. With participants already noticeably jittery, any potential complications in the meeting could accelerate the flight to safety ultimately elevating Gold\u2019s price further. The visible fact that Gold remains resilient despite Dollar\u2019s resurgence continues to highlight how risk aversion has become a key theme this week. Some more photos from today\u2019s anti-austerity protests in Athens have arrived: Reuters explains why they\u2019re protesting: \u201cTsipras has betrayed us,\u201d said Stelios Vitzilaios as he marched with about another 4,000 pensioners through Athens with the aid of a walking stick. He started work at the age of 14, and now takes a 550-euro pension a month, 100 euros less than pre-crisis levels. Pensioners in the country are often the sole means of support in a household, where a quarter of the workforce is jobless. Several said their pensions were financially supporting unemployed adult members of their family and that they scrimped on food. \u201cWe have cut everything. We only eat beans,\u201d said Triainos Softsis, 82. His 800-euro pension was cut to 650 euro during the crisis, and now, he says, he financially supports two children and grandchildren. The Greek debt crisis is heating up, as public anger over its austerity programme bubbles up again. Thousands of people have taken part in a march in Athens today, protesting against pension cuts under various Greek bailout packages since the crisis began. The demonstration comes as Greece and its lenders continue to struggle to reach an agreement to finally unlock fresh bailout loans, which have been frozen for months. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the situation in Malta on Friday; but it seems unlikely that a deal will be reached in time. Our Athens correspondent, Helens Smith, reports that a team of senior economy ministry officials, lead by finance minister Euclid Tskalaotos, are flying to Brussels for emergency talks about the issue: Monitors representing the EU and IMF were meant to have returned to Athens to continue their progress report yesterday. But with the Greek government regarding the review as an all-inconclusive package that will define Greece\u2019s post-bailout future, talks have stumbled once again over horse trading on the fiscal measures Athens will have to enforce to ensure a primary surplus of 3.5 % once the programme ends in 2018. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras will meet with the European Council president Donald Tusk in Athens tomorrow and is expected to hold telephone talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel later today. He has already said he\u2019ll only accept a deal that also tackles the issue of Greece\u2019s staggering debt pile. Tsipras wants to secure a staff level agreement that would allow monitors to resume inspections in Athens by Friday. But there is also mounting speculation that with its own popularity now in free fall, the leftist led administration may go for broke in a repeat of the drama-filled summer of 2015 with Greece hurtling towards default as massive debt repayments fall due in July. Retail sales across the eurozone have risen, in another sign that the European economy is strengthening. Stats firm Eurostat reports that retail spending rose by 0.7% during February, and was a chunky 1.8% higher than a year ago. Spending on \u2018non-food products\u2019 was 2.8% higher, year-on-year, while spending on food, drink and tobacco rose by 0.8% and petrol spending was up 0.5%. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank says it backs up earlier upbeat \u2018soft\u2019 data: We\u2019ve also learned today that Britons are paying more at the check-out, as supermarkets pass on higher import costs. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: A sharp rise in food prices has added \u00a321.31 to the average household shopping bill over the past three months, as the level of promotions fell to an 11-year low, according to new grocery market data. The price of everyday goods at supermarkets rose 2.3% in the three months to 26 March from a year ago, said Kantar Worldpanel, a sharp pick-up from the 0.2% food price inflation recorded in the 12 weeks to 1 January \u2013 the first time prices rose in just over two years. More here: Kathleen Brooks of City Index reckons that today\u2019s construction figures, and yesterday\u2019s slowdown in factory growth, suggest that the UK economy is slowing. She writes: Of course, this is early days, and the PMI surveys are impacted by multiple factors, but the decline in the manufacturing and construction PMIs, two sectors impacted by Brexit, suggests that the economic impact of the decision to leave the EU may start to show itself more than nine months after the vote to leave the EU. The key test will be the services sector PMI due out on Wednesday, if it\u2019s a hat trick of weaker than expected data, we would expect this to be reflected in weaker sterling and UK equities. GBP/USD had a bad start to the quarter, but it has found some support at the 50-day sma at 1.2430 this morning, this is helping to boost sterling for now, but we could see it falling below this level if the economic data starts to slow. March\u2019s construction PMI is the second weakest reading since last September, when the economy shook off the immediate shock of the Brexit vote. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says today\u2019s report is \u201clargely uninspiring\u201d, especially given the slowdown in new housebuilding. He writes: Expansion was at the equal lowest level (with January) since last September\u2019 largely due to slower housebuilding growth which will be particularly disappointing for the government given its desire to lift the UK\u2019s housing stock to tackle the acute shortage.... Following on from a third successive modestly softer manufacturing purchasing managers survey for March, the lacklustre construction PMI maintains suspicion the UK economy is beginning to falter. Signs of slowing UK growth is particularly evident in consumer spending. Paul Trigg, construction specialist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, is worried that UK construction firms will be dragged down by economic headwinds and rising inflation. \u201cDespite 526 privately owned construction companies failing so far this year, the level of sector insolvencies has remained elevated but stable over the last 12 months. Businesses are generally reporting robust trading conditions, particularly across civil engineering which has been buoyed by Government commitments to keep the UK building. \u201cAn increase in construction failures appears unavoidable as the economic headwinds of Brexit strengthen. The commercial market is particularly fragile and those companies at the end of the supply chain, such as fit-out businesses, will be hit hardest by an increase in overdue payments \u2013 the inevitable consequence of falling retail sales and rising inflation.\u201d Brexit fears may have receded for now, but many builders are worrying how they\u2019ll find enough brickies, plasterers and electricians once the UK leaves the EU. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: \u201cCivil engineering continues to be the star performer in the sector thanks to a number of mega-projects in the works across the UK, some of which were given the green light before the EU referendum. \u201cWith the triggering of Article 50 last week, the most significant issue on the industry\u2019s radar remains labour. Almost 10% of UK construction workers are from the EU and in London that rises to a quarter. Contractors are therefore keen to understand what can be done to maintain access to this labour, otherwise they potentially face both increased costs and project delays. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade, says the UK construction figures are \u201cunderwhelming\u201d. \u201cWhile the purchasing managers\u2019 index still indicates growth, it\u2019s very modest. UK construction has been largely in retreat since December\u2019s figure of 54.2 and there are dark clouds forming over the sector. \u201cThe housing market appears somewhat weary and the UK economy overall is likely to slow as it navigates its way through Brexit. All eyes will now be on tomorrow\u2019s PMI services data.\u201d Today\u2019s report suggests that Britain\u2019s building sector barely grew in the last quarter: Here are the key findings from Markit\u2019s report into the UK construction sector: Business activity growth eases in March Housing slowdown offsets rebound in civil engineering and commercial work Input price inflation slows further from January\u2019s peak Breaking: Growth in Britain\u2019s building industry slowed a little last month, as housebuilding lost momentum. But builders are still upbeat about their prospects for this year, as worries over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU fade a little. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector. It has fallen to 52.2 for March, down from 52.5 in February, and lower than expected. Building firms reported that new business was still subdued, with some clients holding back from commissioning projects due to squeezed budgets, and planning delays. But construction bosses also reported that \u201creduced Brexit-related anxiety and the resilient economic backdrop\u201d was helping, Markit says. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says that builders remain confident, despite signs that growth is weakening: \u201cUK construction firms experienced a growth slowdown in March, with the loss of momentum centred on housebuilding. A weaker trend for residential work has been reported throughout 2017 so far, which provides an indication that the cooling UK housing market has started to act as a drag on the construction sector. \u201cCivil engineering projects were the construction sector\u2019s main growth engine in March, driven by rising infrastructure spending and a strong pipeline of new work throughout the UK. \u201cMarch data showed a slight rebound in commercial construction activity. Survey respondents noted that the resilient economic backdrop and receding Brexit- related anxieties have helped to stabilise client demand after the disruption to development projects last summer. I\u2019ll pull together more reaction now South African government bonds have fallen sharply this morning, matching the drop in the rand. Shares in the country\u2019s banks are also being hit, on worries that other credit ratings could follow S&amp;P and downgrade South Africa to Junk. Economist Wandile Sihlobo has tweeted a chart showing how SA\u2019s credit rating rose steadily after apartheid was abolished, but has been falling since the financial crisis: That partly reflects the rise and fall of commodity prices over the period. In the City, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 40 points in early trading to 7321 - helped by a falling pound. Gold maker Randgold are the biggest rise, up 1.7%, followed by packaging firm Bunzl. Major exporters such as Rolls-Royce and AstraZeneca are also up, benefitting from sterling\u2019s weakness. The pound has shed half a cent this morning, dropping back to $1.2425 ahead of today\u2019s construction figures. However, the crisis in South Africa is pulling down companies with exposure to the country, such as insurer Old Mutual. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets warns: South Africa\u2019s Rand has taken another dive overnight after S&amp;P cut the nation\u2019s sovereign credit rating to \u2018junk\u2019 in light of recent political upheaval. Keep an eye on the likes of FTSE-listed Old Mutual, Investec and Mondi which are all exposed to the currency and have already been troubled of late as a consequence. Over in Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index has hit a 10-week low. Investors are fretting about Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese premier Xi later this week. Weak US car sales figures released on Monday are also dampening the mood Kit Juckes of Societe Generale senses a gloomy mood in the markets: There\u2019s an abundance of angst this morning, stemming from weak US car data, the explosion in the St Petersburg subway, the prospect of Donald Trump meeting Xi Jinping at the end of the week and the rapidly approaching French election. S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade will deter some risk-averse investors from holding South African debt, as Paul Donovan of UBS explains: The move was anticipated by markets (credit rating agency actions normally are), but it does have a bearing on the universe of investors who can invest in the country. The South African rand is suffering fresh losses this morning, as the political crisis gripping the country threatens its credit rating. The rand has tumbled by 1.5% to below 13.8 rand to the US dollar. That extends last week\u2019s losses, triggered by the sacking of well-respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The slump came after Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s slashed South Africa\u2019s credit rating into Junk status, from BBB- to BB+, with a negative outlook. S&amp;P warned that \u201cthe likelihood that economic growth and fiscal outcomes could suffer\u201d had increased, following prime minister Jacob Zuma\u2019s cabinet reshuffle. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed fears that the rand could suffer further losses. The elevated political risks after firing the finance minister will continue to be reflected in the country\u2019s currency. From a fundamental perspective, the rand looks undervalued, but how much lower it might drop in the short run depends on the political developments. A 5-10% fall from current levels is very likely. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s slowdown in UK manufacturing growth, Britain\u2019s construction sector is in the spotlight. Markit\u2019s Construction Purchasing Managers Index, due a 9.30, will show how Britain\u2019s builders fared in March. Economists are expecting to see another month of steady but unspectacular growth, with the PMI unchanged at 52.5. But a weaker reading might worry the City, as traders look for signs of economic uncertainty. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group puts it: If UK construction growth disappoints like manufacturing, it will be another dose of cold water poured on the UK economic outlook post-Brexit. Also coming up today: The European Central Bank is launching the new \u20ac50 note in Frankfurt at 2.30pm GMT. ECB president Mario Draghi will say a few words. In the economic calendar, we get eurozone retail sales figures for February at 10am GMT, and US factory orders data at 3pm GMT. Research group Kantar Worldpanel are publishing the latest supermarket sales figures. And in the City, online fashion chain ASOS is reporting results.",

While the economy has proved resilient to the vote for Brexit, the outlook is very uncertain and there are signs that growth has started to slow as higher inflation pinches households\u2019 spending power. Meanwhile there are few signs as yet that the inflationary effects of the post-referendum drop in the pound are feeding through into broader price pressures. There is also a danger that a premature policy tightening would push the pound sharply higher and hence halt the rebalancing of the economy towards the external sector.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0914d89358ca8d59d5e234d2583248b9f0204197\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0914d89358ca8d59d5e234d2583248b9f0204197/0_91_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But we think the markets have gone too far in pushing rate hikes out beyond next year. After all, the current unprecedentedly loose policy stance was initiated to prevent the 2008 recession from turning into a 1930s style depression and enhanced to mitigate the expected damage from of the vote for Brexit. Yet with depression risks having long receded, there is a strong case for scaling back the emergency stimulus. This case will become clearer if, as we expect, the economy continues to confound the worst fears of the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>Accordingly, our central forecast is now for Bank Rate to start to rise in the second quarter of next year and then climb to about 1.25% by the end of 2019. ..This would be an earlier and rather faster rise than the markets and most forecasters are anticipating. We would stress that such a path for interest rates would primarily reflect a fairly healthy economy rather than serious inflation worries. Nonetheless, it is likely to put at least some upward pressure on gilt yields. We forecast the 10-year yield to rise to 1.5% by the end of this year and to 2.5% by the end of next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e50630e4b05776df18add9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-05T15:03:11.446Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks in surprise increase</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US crude stocks unexpectedly rose last week, taking some of the shine off oil prices.</strong></p> <p>Crude inventories rose by 1.6m barrels to 535.5m, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of a 100,000 decline.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street may be bouncing higher in the wake of better than expected jobs data, but the picture was more mixed in Europe. US investors shrugged off concerns about President Trump\u2019s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, while the ADP employment data suggested a better than expected outcome from Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. In the UK, the FTSE 100 moved ahead but the German and French markets fell back. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.86 points or 0.13% at 7331.68 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.53% to 12,217.54 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.18% at 5091.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged 0.02% lower to 20,253.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.4% higher at 10,402.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.53% to 669.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 152 points or 0.74%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. UK interest rates could start to rise in the second quarter of next year despite continuing uncertainty over the outlook for the country\u2019s economy, says Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics: Market expectations for the future path of UK interest rates have continued to nudge lower in recent days in response to evidence that the economy\u2019s growth rate has slowed a bit in the first quarter and some dovish noises from policymakers...The implied timing of the first 25bp hike in rates \u2013 derived from overnight indexed swaps (OIS) \u2013 has shifted back from late 2018 earlier in the month to the middle of 2019. This has pushed 10-year gilt yields down to six-month lows of just above 1%. As MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe stressed on Wednesday, there certainly are some good reasons for the MPC to tread cautiously. While the economy has proved resilient to the vote for Brexit, the outlook is very uncertain and there are signs that growth has started to slow as higher inflation pinches households\u2019 spending power. Meanwhile there are few signs as yet that the inflationary effects of the post-referendum drop in the pound are feeding through into broader price pressures. There is also a danger that a premature policy tightening would push the pound sharply higher and hence halt the rebalancing of the economy towards the external sector. But we think the markets have gone too far in pushing rate hikes out beyond next year. After all, the current unprecedentedly loose policy stance was initiated to prevent the 2008 recession from turning into a 1930s style depression and enhanced to mitigate the expected damage from of the vote for Brexit. Yet with depression risks having long receded, there is a strong case for scaling back the emergency stimulus. This case will become clearer if, as we expect, the economy continues to confound the worst fears of the impact of Brexit. Accordingly, our central forecast is now for Bank Rate to start to rise in the second quarter of next year and then climb to about 1.25% by the end of 2019. ..This would be an earlier and rather faster rise than the markets and most forecasters are anticipating. We would stress that such a path for interest rates would primarily reflect a fairly healthy economy rather than serious inflation worries. Nonetheless, it is likely to put at least some upward pressure on gilt yields. We forecast the 10-year yield to rise to 1.5% by the end of this year and to 2.5% by the end of next year. US crude stocks unexpectedly rose last week, taking some of the shine off oil prices. Crude inventories rose by 1.6m barrels to 535.5m, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of a 100,000 decline. Brent, which had been as high at $55 a barrel earlier, lost some of its gains and is currently at $54.32, still up 0.28% on the day. In the current US market resurgence, the Nasdaq Composite has just hit a new record high of 5929, two days after the previous one. Despite the slightly disappointing service sector figures, Wall Street has continued its positive mood, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up around 180 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Mixed signals from the US economy couldn\u2019t prevent the Dow Jones from finally bursting back into life this afternoon. Having been trapped between 20600 and 20700 for the past fortnight the Dow awoke from its slumber in style this Wednesday, rising 180 points to hit its highest level since the first Trump healthcare doubts entered the market on March 21. It helped that the dollar was fairly quiet after the bell; though it took 0.6% off the Japanese yen, it made minimal headway against the euro and lost 0.3% against sterling. The thrust of the Dow\u2019s gains seemed to stem from the ADP non-farm reading, which vastly outperformed expectations at 263k against the 184k (February\u2019s figure, on the other hand, was revised from an extraordinary 298k to a more reasonable 245k). To maintain its gains the US index did have to ignore some concerning services PMIs, however; the Markit reading slipped to 52.8 from the initial 52.9 estimate, while the ISM figure plunged to a 5 month low of 55.2. And here is more detail on what the ISM respondents have been saying: \u201cGrowth on [a] number of projects has slowed a little, but revenue projections are steady.\u201d (Construction) \u201cThe details of the revisions to the Obamacare program are of great interest to us. There is a large amount of future uncertainty with what will happen. Meanwhile, the business continues.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cHealth care changes can affect our business. Uncertainty is making us hold on many projects.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cMarket conditions are still favorable with animal proteins due to [the] strong dollar, low exports and [an] abundant supply. Unknown [are] the POTUS\u2019 policies going forward on trade and immigration. Worker shortages have become a real problem in food production and produce growing areas.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cBusiness is picking up. Service labor is tight. New legislation has had significant impact.\u201d (Public Administration) \u201cOverall, business conditions are favorable, and the outlook is positive.\u201d (Retail Trade) \u201cContinued optimism regarding the domestic business environment.\u201d (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u201cFirst quarter has been brisk, and March has been as busy as I [have] ever seen, with many new endeavors.\u201d (Utilities) Despite the ISM figures coming in shy of expectations, they still show an economy heading in the right direction (any reading above 50 indicates expansion). The Institute said: The majority of respondents\u2019 comments indicate a positive outlook on business conditions and the overall economy. There were several comments about the uncertainty of future government policies on health care, trade and immigration, and the potential impact on business. The other US services survey has also fallen short of expectations. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing PMI came in at 55.2 in March, below forecasts of 57 and down on the 57.6 figure in February. This is the lowest level since October last year. And here is the first US service sector report, and it is slightly disappointing. Markit\u2019s final service sector PMI index for March came in at 52.8, down from an initial estimate of 52.9 and the 53.8 recorded in February. The Markit composite index of services and manufacturing was 53 compared to the early reading of 53.2 and February\u2019s 54.1. Ahead of two separate snapshots of the US service sector and following better than expected jobs numbers, American stock markets are heading higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 88 points or 0.43% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.33% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.23%. US markets had been undermined recently by concerns that President Trump\u2019s proposed tax and spending reforms could be stymied in the wake of his healthcare defeat. On the jobs data, which comes ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: ADP came in at 263,000 \u2013 miles above the 180,000 expected. The ADP number isn\u2019t a good predictor of the actual non-farm payroll number. However, it can give a \u201cheads-up\u201d for a big surprise, up or down. So today\u2019s reading suggests we should get a strong reading on Friday. Despite a long run of strong jobs numbers there are some concerns that US economic growth isn\u2019t as robust as it should be. Survey data such as Consumer Confidence, ISM Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs may be robust, but \u201chard data\u201d (with the exception of employment numbers) like Durable Goods, Retail Sales, Construction Spending, Vehicle Sales and Factory Orders have all disappointed recently. This is happening as the Fed proceeds to tighten monetary policy and even hints of starting to wind down its balance sheet later this year. One of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setters has warned that the consumer slowdown in the UK will \u2018intensify\u2019 this year. Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, told an audience in the City that subdued wage growth, and the inflationary impact of the weaker pound, will hit household budgets. Vlieghe says: The consumer slowdown, which initially did not materialise, now appears to be underway. Given the hit to real income from a mix of subdued wage growth and rising inflation, I think the slowdown is more likely to intensify than fade away. That fits with this morning\u2019s report on the service sector, which showed that companies dependent on consumer spending, such as hotels and gyms, were lagging behind the rest of the sector. He also produced this graph, showing how retail sales have weakened in recent months: And this graph, showing how real wages (in red) are expected to hit almost zero as inflation erodes incomes. Vlieghe also fears that business investment, which has been stronger than feared since the Brexit vote, could fall as Britain\u2019s exit from the EU approaches. He argues: It is possible that the absence of a sharp reaction was due to the fact that firms have generally taken a benign view of the impact on their business of possible future changes in the UK-EU relationship. It is also possible that uncertainty about these changes is substantial, but the changes have been too far away to have a marked effect spending decisions so far. As the time horizon now shortens, a more material reaction of spending in response to uncertainty might still occur. Much will depend on the detail of the final agreement, which might not be known until late in the negotiations. The full speech (which also compares economist forecasting to a doctor trying to predict a heart attack) is online here: Good policy vs accurate forecasts There are important developments in Greece today too, as European Council president Donald Tusk visits Athens. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has upped the ante, calling for an emergency meeting of EU leaders if tortuous negotiations over the country\u2019s bailout programme do not end soon. From Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Exploiting the opportunity of a visit by European council president Donald Tusk to Athens, the Greek leader said EU leaders should meet later this month if euro area finance ministers failed to agree on the country\u2019s economic progress on Friday. Ratcheting up the rhetoric, Tsipras said political leaders might have to wade in to stop what he described as \u201cendless\u201d negotiations with international creditors over Greece\u2019s latest compliance review. \u201cI think the initiative will have to be taken at the higher level to have a positive outcome before Easter, in any case, within April, even if this means calling a euro area summit,\u201d he told reporters after holding talks with Tusk. \u201cBut this endless negotiation must come to an end.\u201d The review is key to Greece being given further bailout funds to repay \u20ac7.5bn in maturing debt in July - or confront the prospect of default and euro exit. Tsipras made the remarks as negotiations between Athens and creditors hit fresh snags in Brussels late Tuesday where the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had flown to try and break the deadlock before Friday\u2019s euro group. The leftist-led government, facing criticism for failing to conclude the review \u2013 but also mounting pressure on the street \u2013 is at odds over demands for further pension cuts, tax hikes and labour market reforms. Tsipras claimed that every time Greece was close to an agreement its lenders would call for further measures, adding: \u201cSome people are trying to hurt our recovery and bring a negative scenario back to the table for Greece and Europe during a sensitive time,\u201d Athens had placed great hopes in Tusk\u2019s visit. Attempting to sound a note of optimism, the former Polish prime minister insisted it was expedient the impasse was broken when the euro group convenes on Friday in Malta. \u201cOur finance ministers should do the work to achieve an agreement,\u201d said Tusk who played a prominent role in bringing the country back from the brink when it came closest yet to exiting the euro in mid-2015. He added: \u201cThis is the only positive result for Greece and for the whole [EU] community. \u201cThere is no political and substantial alternative. Newsflash: America\u2019s companies created many more jobs than expected last month. The monthly ADP report shows that the US private sector created 263,000 new jobs in March, more more than the 185,000 which Wall Street expected. It\u2019s another signal that the US labour market is strong, and could indicate that Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report will beat expectations. However.... ADP have also revised down their figures from February, from 298,000 to 245,000. And here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s UK productivity figures: Here\u2019s our news story about March\u2019s record-breaking UK car sales figures: We have more car news....but this time, it\u2019s about strike action not rising sales. British workers at BMW are to hold eight strikes over the next few weeks to oppose plans by the carmaker to close their final salary pensions, and move workers onto a less generous package. It will begin in April 19 with a walkout at BMW\u2019s Mini plant in Oxford, its engine facility near Birmingham, and a factory in Swindon. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey says: \u201cBMW\u2019s refusal to talk about affordable options to keep the pension scheme open means a sizable chunk of its UK workforce will be taking strike action for the first time in the coming weeks. \u201cBosses in the UK and BMW\u2019s headquarters in Munich cannot feign surprise that it\u2019s come to this point. Unite has repeatedly warned of the anger their insistence to railroad through the pension scheme\u2019s closure would generate and the resulting industrial action. In other news, UK productivity has crept higher, but is still much lower than in other G7 countries. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that economic output per hour rose by 0.4% in October-December, up from 0.2% in July-September. It\u2019s a sign that the economy was more productive at the end of 2016. However, productivity has still failed to recover from the financial crisis, if you compare recent figures to the trend before 2008. The ONS also reports that wages grew faster than productivity in the quarter -- something that might make the Bank of England worry. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, fears that the UK economy is entering choppier water. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s service sector report: \u201cWhile the headline index number may have rebounded from a 5 month low in February, there is little to be enamoured with in this reading of the UK\u2019s most important sector; consumers are under pressure, services sector companies that cater to them are weaker and margins are likely being pressured further. Average prices are at the highest level in 8.5 years and whilst some consumer resilience is allowing some of this to be passed on in higher prices on the shelves we have to think that that consumer resilience will give way before the business need to keep prices raised does. In the short term, this means a turning of the screw for the man in the street and a poor outlook for High St profits. This sector makes up the majority of the UK economy and the prognosis is poor.\u201d Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is concerned that consumer-focused companies lagged behind in March: Activity rose to its best level in three months and was a very strong rebound from the five-month low of February. Prices are rising \u2013 largely due to input inflation \u2013 while job creation has slowed a little. Financial services was most resilient sector while consumer-oriented sectors struggled \u2013 evidence that chimes with data suggesting consumers might be about to pull back on some discretionary spending as inflation squeezes incomes. Inflation is overtaking wages and that means one thing \u2013 lower aggregate demand. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank agrees with Markit\u2019s prediction that UK growth slowed to 0.4% in the last quarter (and even provides a graph to back it up) The key point is that the UK continues to enjoy a broad based expansion in output, and we strongly expect it to continue. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight also fears a slowdown this year, as rising inflation hurts consumers. Services activity has been particularly led by the consumer-facing sectors. Looking ahead, we suspect that consumer services activity will be increasingly pressurized by consumers\u2019 purchasing power weakening over the coming months as inflation rises appreciably and earnings growth is muted. This is likely to cause some consumers to cut back on their discretionary spending, including on services. \u2018Services\u2019 is a broad measure, covering around four-fifths of the UK economy. And today\u2019s report shows that consumer-focused sectors had a tough March, while the City powered on. Markit says: Within the service sector, the worst performance so far this year has been seen in consumer- oriented sectors, notably hotels and restaurants, as well as personal consumer services (which include businesses such as sports centres, gyms and hairdressers). The greatest resilience has been seen in financial services. Economists Rupert Seggins has helpfully tweeted more details of the PMI reports: undefined The news that Britain\u2019s service sector grew faster than expected in March has boosted the pound. Sterling jumped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.248, as traders welcomed the pick-up in activity in Britain\u2019s dominant sector. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says: \u201cToday\u2019s services PMI figure has bucked the trend of weak data seen on Monday and Tuesday, paving the way for the pound to make its long-awaited recovery. \u201cDespite underwhelming manufacturing and construction data, the services sector is a key component of the UK economy and today\u2019s number is very encouraging.\u201d Despite beating forecasts, March\u2019s UK PMI report does include some worrying signs. For starters, UK service sector firms created fewer new jobs than in February, with new hiring hitting its slowest pace since August 2016. Markit says this left some firms struggling to get their work done. A combination of rising workloads and softer employment growth contributed to a renewed accumulation of backlogs across the service economy. Some firms noted that squeezed margins and rising wage bills had led to the non- replacement of voluntary leavers. Secondly, firms hiked their prices at their fastest pace in eight and a half-years. This was overwhelmingly linked to higher input costs during recent months. Survey respondents also noted that resilient demand had provided scope to pass on some of their increased costs to clients Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector has posted its strongest growth of the year, after suffering a slowdown over the winter. Data firm IHS Markit reports that business activity growth hit a three-month high in March, driven by a pick-up in new work. Bosses interviewed for the survey said they are optimistic about prospects over the next year --almost half forecast growth while only one-in-nine expect a fall in activity. Some companies said that \u201cBrexit-related uncertainty\u201d was holding back investment decisions. But on the upside, some firms are seeing more demand from abroad thanks to the weak pound. This drove the Services PMI up from 53.3 to 55.0 - the highest reading since December 2016. The PMI has now been over 50 points (the level between expansion and contraction) for eight months. Encouraging stuff. But Markit also predicts that the wider UK economy has probably slowed in the last quarter. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe survey data indicate that UK business activity growth regained some momentum after having slipped to a five-month low in February, but the upturn fails to change the picture of an economy that slowed in the first quarter. \u201cThe relative weakness of the PMI survey data compared to that seen at the turn of the year suggests the economy will have grown by 0.4% in the first quarter, markedly lower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year. \u201cMuch of the disappointment in growth so far this year has been evident in consumer-oriented sectors, in part linked to spending and incomes being squeezed by higher prices. Wow! Britain\u2019s car market has just enjoyed its strongest month ever. Car registrations surged by 8.4% year-on-year in March, to 562,337, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That smashes all records going back to the 1976, beating the previous record in August 1997. The blowout figures were partly driven by a rush to buy cars before vehicle tax changes kicked in this month. This new Vehicle Excise Duty regime pushes up the annual tax bill for more expensive cars, and those which emit more CO2 than average. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, explains: This bumper performance probably means we will see a slowdown in April, exacerbated by the fact there are fewer selling days this year given Easter timing. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we still expect the market to cool only slightly given broader political uncertainties as there are still attractive deals on offer.\u201d As usual, Ford cars were the most popular: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi flags up how the eurozone had a good quarter: Boom! The eurozone\u2019s private sector has posted its best quarter since the start of the financial crisis. Data firm Markit reports that Eurozone output and new order growth accelerated to near six-year records in March. That drove its service sector PMI up to 56.0, up from 55.5, and the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 (which also includes manufacturing data) up to 56.4. The report found that: March saw the strongest inflows of new business into the eurozone economy since April 2011. Employment growth was the sharpest in over nine- and-a-half years. Price pressures remained strong in March. Input cost inflation was close to February\u2019s 69-month record, reflecting rising global commodity prices and the historically weak euro exchange rate. Business optimism rose to a fresh series-record high, improving at service providers and remaining relatively elevated at manufacturers too. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says the report signals an \u201cimpressive\u201d rate of economic growth: \u201cThis is a broad-based upturn among the euro\u2019s largest members, with 0.6% growth signalled for both Germany and France, while Spain looks set to have enjoyed 0.8-0.9% growth in the first quarter, according to the PMI data. Growth has also perked up in Italy during the first quarter despite a slight pull-back in March, with the surveys indicating a 0.3-0.4% expansion. \u201cMost welcome for a region still suffering near- double digit unemployment is a rise in the survey\u2019s employment index to its highest for almost a decade, suggesting we should expect to see the jobless rate fall further in coming months. Another good month for Germany: We have good news from France; its private sector has posted its fastest growth in 70 months. Italy\u2019s services sector has slowed a little, with its PMI dipping to 52.9, from 54.1 European markets are muted this morning, as investors digest the news that North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan overnight. That missile test appears to be a defiant signal from Pyongyang ahead of the US-China summit later this week, where North Korea will be high on the agenda. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Keeping the peace in Asia is just another item on the agenda which will be important for both leaders to talk about. North Korea tested another missile last night and this has increased tensions over in Asia. This will also add another dimension to President Trump and President Xi\u2019s meeting. The US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has already made the US\u2019 position clear by signalling that the US will not tolerate such activities. So the FTSE 100 has climbed by 20-odd points, but other European markets are down a little. Zing! The second first healthcheck on the eurozone has arrived, and it\u2019s a belter. The Spanish service sector PMI has beaten expectations by hitting 57.4, close to February\u2019s 18-month high of 57.7. Spanish firms reported a rise in new orders, and better market conditions. This encouraged them to take on more staff, which is great news given Spain\u2019s persistent unemployment problem. But many companies also said they hiked prices, passing on higher costs to customers. Markit says: In response to rising input costs, companies increased their output prices. Moreover, the rate of charge inflation accelerated to the fastest since July 2007. Four of the six monitored sectors saw output prices rise, led by Post &amp; Telecommunications. The Financial Services and Hotels &amp; Restaurants categories were the only two to post declines. March was a very kind month for the Swedish economy. The Swedish service sector PMI has bounded up to 61.3, from 59.8 -- a rather high reading, and well into expansion territory. That follows very solid manufacturing figures on Monday, which showed the fastest growth in seven years. Ireland\u2019s service sector has recorded another strong month, although growth did slow slightly. The Irish Services PMI has dipped to 59.1 in March from 60.6 in February. That\u2019s the weakest reading of 2017, but still showing a solid expansion. Investec, which compiles the survey, says: The increase was recorded amid greater volumes of new work and reports of an improved economic environment. Overnight, we\u2019ve learned that Japan\u2019s service sector grew at its fastest pace in 19 months in March. The Japanese services PMI rose to 52.9, up from 51.3, helped by a rise in business confidence. That suggests that the country\u2019s economy strengthened last month, says Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit: Growth is broad-based. Both the manufacturing and service sectors are enjoying upturns, supported by firm demand for goods and services. With capacity pressures subsequently intensifying, this is having a positive spillover into the labour market. Jobs continued to be added at a solid pace in March. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s service sector makes up almost 80% of the economy, from financial firms in the City of London to restaurants and tourist attractions around the country. So today\u2019s healthcheck on the service sector should give a good insight into how the economy fared last month. The Service sector PMI, produced by data firm Markit, lands at 9.30am GMT - and it expected to show steady growth last month. City economists predict that the PMI will increase from 53.5, from 53.3 in February -- meaning growth accelerated at a faster rate last month. That would be a good sign for economic growth in the first three months of 2017. But after weaker-than-expected figures from manufacturing and construction companies this week, a disappointing reading can\u2019t be ruled out. Markit are also publishing service sector reports from across the eurozone this morning. That\u2019s likely to show a solid rise in activity in March, as the eurozone recovery continues. But RBC Capital warns: We expect some weakening in the March services PMIs for Spain and Italy today. Also coming up today Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the Bank of England policymakers who set interest rates, is giving a speech at 1.30pm BST. Vlieghe is one of the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, so investors will be listening out for any comments on interest rates. Investors are getting edgier about the summit meeting between presidents Trump and Xi later this week. The Chinese premier is in Helsinki today, on a trip to build closer economic and political ties with Finland; we might get some comments from Xi on the importance of free trade (an issue he highlighted at Davos back in January). Former Finnish prime minister Alex Stubb is tweeting about the visit: On the economics calendar, we get the latest UK car sales figures at 9am BST.

February\u2019s jobs report was the first under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and was seized upon by the president as evidence that his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs was coming true.</p> <p>Economists had been expecting the economy to add 180,000 jobs in March but a combination of factors appear to have stalled the growth in the jobs market.</p> <p>March saw snow storms sweep across much of the eastern seaboard which may have slowed hiring. And in late January Trump ordered a civilian government hiring freeze, calling for no vacant federal positions to be filled and none to be created until his budget director has drawn up a long-term cost-cutting plan. That decision will only now be filtering into the jobs figures.</p> <p>Retailers lost 30,000 jobs in March as many of its biggest names announced plans to shut stores in the face of online competition.

We had been looking for a soft figure, but certainly not this poor. We reasoned that unseasonably warm weather had helped boost construction activity and jobs in January and February (when building sites often typically shut down), so we wouldn\u2019t get the usual bounce in March and this does appear to have happened \u2013 construction jobs rose 34k in Jan and 58k in Feb, but only 6k in March.</p> <p>However, there was some real disappointment in retail trade, which saw employment fall 30k after a 31k drop in February while transport services also saw two consecutive monthly falls (-27k in March after -16k in February). This seems to tally somewhat with weaker consumer spending data and is something worth watching.</p> <p>On the other side of the equation, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5% (lowest since 2007) from 4.7%. Using this household survey, employment has risen 920,000 in the past two months so there is a real contradiction with the employment survey, which will only add to the confusion on how to interpret the report. Rounding out the figures, wages rose 0.2%/2.7%, which was in line with market expectations. Unfortunately, given the lack of a clear message from this report it is difficult to come up with a simple conclusion.</p> <p>For now we are forecasting just one additional Fed rate rise this year, but consumer spending will be a key story to watch. Spending growth has been fairly soft recently, which may be the result of households starting to feel a squeeze on spending power now that the cost of living (CPI at 2.7%YoY) is increasing at the same rate as wage growth. Weak spending growth is also consistent with the poor retail jobs numbers within the report. Nonetheless, consumers are upbeat with sentiment close to cycle highs.</p> <p>This is likely to be down to the healthy jobs market, but could also be partially due to President Trump\u2019s promises of \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts. If tax cuts are delayed or watered down by Congress then we may see sentiment drop back. In an environment where consumer spending is looking a little vulnerable the market may consider scaling back its expectations for Fed policy tightening \u2013 next week\u2019s retail sales report could be an interesting barometer.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e78a31e4b0e0ec04efeac9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T12:52:04.378Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s some reaction to the weak US jobs numbers:</p> <h2><strong>Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab: </strong></h2> <p> While we saw strong results in January and February, boosted by better weather, conversely, March has been impacted negatively by the reverse. However, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes. We\u2019ll need to see more hard data before we know whether these numbers are the start of a downward trend away from the strong jobs market or merely a temporary blip on the radar.</p> <p>Investors are facing the realisation that \u201csoft\u201d data\u2014such as confidence readings and business surveys\u2014doesn\u2019t necessarily translate immediately into \u201chard\u201d data\u2014like retail sales, capital expenditures, and industrial production. It\u2019s this hard data that translates into economic growth and increasing profitability. Looking at some of the parabolic moves in recent confidence surveys, it would be difficult for hard data to keep up.</p> <p>US stocks have suffered some downward pressure recently as overly optimistic investor sentiment has boiled off, however, the economy is robust, earnings have picked up, and we expect the bull market in American equities to run for some time.</p> <h2><strong>David Morrison, </strong>Senior Market Strategist at Spreadco:</h2> <p>While March\u2019s NFP consensus expectation has held steady around 175,000, Wednesday\u2019s strong ADP release caused many analysts to revise up their forecasts. It\u2019s fair to say that quite a few traders were looking for job gains of around 200,000 today</p> <p>Unemployment Rate fell to 4.5% and has held at 5% or below for 18 months now \u2013 representing full employment for the longest period since the Financial Crisis.</p> <p>Of course, Average Earnings are key as these are vital in flagging up inflationary pressures and these were steady at +0.2% month-on-month.</p> <p>There is also the worry that fiscal stimulus may take longer to come through than is currently priced in to markets. If the Trump administration finds it is unable to push through tax cuts, regulatory reform and infrastructure spending this year, then we could see a significant pull-back in equity prices.</p> <h2>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com:</h2> <p>With interest rates hiked last month, and President Trump\u2019s pledges to put jobs at the heart of his presidency, March\u2019s drop in non-farm payroll will bring both surprise and concern, especially with price growth on the rise.</p> <p>Uninterrupted jobs growth since last August, combined with rising inflation and accelerating wages, contributed to the rate increase at the most recent Fed meeting.</p> <p>The Fed has forecast two more rises in 2017, and while this will please savers, Trump will likely have to deal with the political fallout as consumers begin to feel the pinch.</p> <h2><strong>Naeem Aslam, </strong><strong>Chief Market Analyst at </strong><strong>Think Markets UK:</strong></h2> <p>The US NFP data has confirmed that February\u2019s blowout number was an anomaly since many were arguing that the rise is chiefly caused by mild weather conditions. Consumer spending is the cornerstone of the US economy, and we know that so far this quarter, this number has been in a massive trouble. If we want to see robust GDP growth, we need this number to bounce back strongly and the only way that we can see this happening, is mainly due to higher wage growths. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e78857e4b05776df18b7d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T12:44:53.701Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The 98,000 jobs added in March was the lowest figure for ten months, with the retail sector shedding workers for the second month in a row.</p> <p>But the unemployment rate fell form 4.7% to 4.5%, said <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ces/#news\">the Bureau of Labor Statistics,</a> the lowest level since May 2007.</p> <p>The January and February figures, although revised down, were still above 200,000 and benefitted from warmer weather leading to employment growth in areas like construction and leisure.

A key component of this moderation has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year.

                "bodyText":"With a combination of the US attack on Syria and much weaker than expected jobs numbers for March, it is no surprise that Wall Street has got off to a cautious start. But there is no real panic selling, and after an initial dip the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory, up 5 points or 0.03% . The S&amp;P 500 opened down a mere 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite is marginally ahead. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac 0.1%. The FTSE 100 has added 0.3%, helped by a good performance from Randgold Resources as the gold price climbs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. US markets look like they may well shrug off the disappointing jobs figures: Back with Greece and after eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirmed their had been discussions with the International Monetary Fund this week, comes a reasonably upbeat statement from that very organisation. IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice said: There has been important progress in recent weeks. A number of policy issues remain outstanding. But we are at a point where we think there are good prospects for successfully concluding discussions on these outstanding policy issues during the next mission to Athens. Such an agreement on policies will have to be followed by discussions with euro area countries to ensure satisfactory assurances on a credible strategy to restore debt sustainability, before a program is presented to the IMF Executive Board. Here\u2019s our report on the disappointing jobs figures: The US economy added just 98,000 jobs in March as a cold snap, a government hiring freeze and a faltering retail sector appear to have put the chill on president Donald Trump\u2019s promise to boost hiring. The jobs market had got off to a flying start in 2017, adding an average of 236,500 jobs a month. February\u2019s jobs report was the first under Donald Trump and was seized upon by the president as evidence that his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs was coming true. Economists had been expecting the economy to add 180,000 jobs in March but a combination of factors appear to have stalled the growth in the jobs market. March saw snow storms sweep across much of the eastern seaboard which may have slowed hiring. And in late January Trump ordered a civilian government hiring freeze, calling for no vacant federal positions to be filled and none to be created until his budget director has drawn up a long-term cost-cutting plan. That decision will only now be filtering into the jobs figures. Retailers lost 30,000 jobs in March as many of its biggest names announced plans to shut stores in the face of online competition. In the past several months, Macy\u2019s has announced it will close 63 stores; Sears, 150; The Limited, 250; BCBG Max Azria, 120; Guess, 60; American Apparel, 104; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, 60; JCPenney, up to 140. There was some good news. The unemployment rate declined to 4.5% and average hourly earnings rose 2.7%, or 68 cents, from a year earlier. The full story is here: The non-farms report does not really give a clear message on the state of the US economy, says James Knightley at ING Bank: The headline from the US jobs report is the big miss on payrolls, which rose only 98,000 versus expectations of a 180,000 rise. We had been looking for a soft figure, but certainly not this poor. We reasoned that unseasonably warm weather had helped boost construction activity and jobs in January and February (when building sites often typically shut down), so we wouldn\u2019t get the usual bounce in March and this does appear to have happened \u2013 construction jobs rose 34k in Jan and 58k in Feb, but only 6k in March. However, there was some real disappointment in retail trade, which saw employment fall 30k after a 31k drop in February while transport services also saw two consecutive monthly falls (-27k in March after -16k in February). This seems to tally somewhat with weaker consumer spending data and is something worth watching. On the other side of the equation, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5% (lowest since 2007) from 4.7%. Using this household survey, employment has risen 920,000 in the past two months so there is a real contradiction with the employment survey, which will only add to the confusion on how to interpret the report. Rounding out the figures, wages rose 0.2%/2.7%, which was in line with market expectations. Unfortunately, given the lack of a clear message from this report it is difficult to come up with a simple conclusion. For now we are forecasting just one additional Fed rate rise this year, but consumer spending will be a key story to watch. Spending growth has been fairly soft recently, which may be the result of households starting to feel a squeeze on spending power now that the cost of living (CPI at 2.7%YoY) is increasing at the same rate as wage growth. Weak spending growth is also consistent with the poor retail jobs numbers within the report. Nonetheless, consumers are upbeat with sentiment close to cycle highs. This is likely to be down to the healthy jobs market, but could also be partially due to President Trump\u2019s promises of \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts. If tax cuts are delayed or watered down by Congress then we may see sentiment drop back. In an environment where consumer spending is looking a little vulnerable the market may consider scaling back its expectations for Fed policy tightening \u2013 next week\u2019s retail sales report could be an interesting barometer. Here\u2019s some reaction to the weak US jobs numbers: Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab: While we saw strong results in January and February, boosted by better weather, conversely, March has been impacted negatively by the reverse. However, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes. We\u2019ll need to see more hard data before we know whether these numbers are the start of a downward trend away from the strong jobs market or merely a temporary blip on the radar. Investors are facing the realisation that \u201csoft\u201d data\u2014such as confidence readings and business surveys\u2014doesn\u2019t necessarily translate immediately into \u201chard\u201d data\u2014like retail sales, capital expenditures, and industrial production. It\u2019s this hard data that translates into economic growth and increasing profitability. Looking at some of the parabolic moves in recent confidence surveys, it would be difficult for hard data to keep up. US stocks have suffered some downward pressure recently as overly optimistic investor sentiment has boiled off, however, the economy is robust, earnings have picked up, and we expect the bull market in American equities to run for some time. David Morrison, Senior Market Strategist at Spreadco: While March\u2019s NFP consensus expectation has held steady around 175,000, Wednesday\u2019s strong ADP release caused many analysts to revise up their forecasts. It\u2019s fair to say that quite a few traders were looking for job gains of around 200,000 today Unemployment Rate fell to 4.5% and has held at 5% or below for 18 months now \u2013 representing full employment for the longest period since the Financial Crisis. Of course, Average Earnings are key as these are vital in flagging up inflationary pressures and these were steady at +0.2% month-on-month. There is also the worry that fiscal stimulus may take longer to come through than is currently priced in to markets. If the Trump administration finds it is unable to push through tax cuts, regulatory reform and infrastructure spending this year, then we could see a significant pull-back in equity prices. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: With interest rates hiked last month, and President Trump\u2019s pledges to put jobs at the heart of his presidency, March\u2019s drop in non-farm payroll will bring both surprise and concern, especially with price growth on the rise. Uninterrupted jobs growth since last August, combined with rising inflation and accelerating wages, contributed to the rate increase at the most recent Fed meeting. The Fed has forecast two more rises in 2017, and while this will please savers, Trump will likely have to deal with the political fallout as consumers begin to feel the pinch. Naeem Aslam, Chief Market Analyst at Think Markets UK: The US NFP data has confirmed that February\u2019s blowout number was an anomaly since many were arguing that the rise is chiefly caused by mild weather conditions. Consumer spending is the cornerstone of the US economy, and we know that so far this quarter, this number has been in a massive trouble. If we want to see robust GDP growth, we need this number to bounce back strongly and the only way that we can see this happening, is mainly due to higher wage growths. The 98,000 jobs added in March was the lowest figure for ten months, with the retail sector shedding workers for the second month in a row. But the unemployment rate fell form 4.7% to 4.5%, said the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the lowest level since May 2007. The January and February figures, although revised down, were still above 200,000 and benefitted from warmer weather leading to employment growth in areas like construction and leisure. But falling temperatures and storms in March seem to have hit the hiring rate. President Trump may be putting a lot of emphasis on job creation, but the widely watched non-farm payroll figures for March have come in much lower than expected. In all 98,000 jobs were added last month, well down on the forecast 180,000. And February\u2019s figure was revised down from 235,000 to 219.000 while January was cut from the initial 238,000 to 216,000. Back with the UK, and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research says weak retail sales hit GDP growth in the first quarter. Its monthly estimates of GDP show output grew by 0.5% in the three months to the end of March, unchanged from the three months to February. In the final quarter of 2016, growth was 0.6%. NIESR\u2019s James Warren said: We estimate growth slowed slightly in the first quarter of 2017 to 0.5 per cent. A key component of this moderation has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\u2019 purchasing power. We expect the Bank of England to look through this temporary shock to inflation and for monetary policy to remain accommodative. Earlier came weak UK industrial production, manufacturing output and trade figures. Over in Athens protestors aligned with the communist party workers\u2019 union, Pame, are already gearing up for action announcing mass protests nationwide, writes Helena Smith. The labour organisation has called on workers nationwide to take to the streets. A mass demonstration will be held outside the Greek parliament later this afternoon with some protests also taking place on far-flung Aegean islands such as Ikaria tomorrow. \u201cThe government has agreed to further butcher the labour and social security rights of workers,\u201d Pame said in a statement adding that the new measures had been drafted in cahoots with industrialists, the European Union and hated International Monetary Fund. And more from Dijsselbloem following the meeting: And here\u2019s the eurogroup statement on Greece: The Eurogroup was briefed on developments in the intense talks between the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism and the Greek government over the past month. The institutions and the Greek authorities reached an agreement on the main elements of policy reforms required to move ahead with the second review of the current macroeconomic adjustment programme, which is necessary to unlock further financial assistance to Greece. This agreement refers to the size, timing and sequencing of the reforms. The Institutions will continue technical work in Athens as soon as possible to swiftly conclude a staff level agreement. Senior officials in Athens are saying whatever deal was agreed at the eurogroup meeting in Malta today, agreement must now be put to the Greek parliament for a vote \u2026 which is where things may get testy. Helena Smith reports: The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and prime minister Alexis Tsipras will now need all their persuasive powers to ram whatever measures have been agreed with creditors through parliament. In recent weeks, leading figures in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, have voiced deep disgruntlement over the concessions Tsakalotos has had to make to wrap up the compliance review at the heart of Athens\u2019 latest standoff with creditors. Tsakalotos, addressing reporters in Malta, was quick to give a hint of the disquiet that lies ahead saying: \u201cThere are things that will upset the Greek people.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, the Interior Minister, Panos Skourletis, an outspoken critic of the austerity Greece has had to accept in exchange for emergency bailout funding, said much would depend on the \u201cfinal picture\u201d that emerged. The measures, he said, would likely be put to parliament (in the form of emergency legislation) after Easter. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is possible that they will be brought to parliament before Easter because it closes next Wednesday,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe devil is in the detail. We don\u2019t have a final picture yet \u2026 ideologically all of us in Syriza have disagreed with these policies, measures that only stoke recession, since the great compromise our government was forced to make in the summer of 2015.\u201d The eurogroup press conference is over, but Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is now speaking: Despite the optimism Dijsselbloem warned time was still running out: The situation in Greece is not improving, it is all our faults, we are taking too long, the momentum is slipping away. We need to get it done well in time for the next Greek payment. Jeroen Dijsselbloem is asked whether the International Monetary Fund, which has been reluctant to join further bailouts without debt relief, agrees with this result. He says there have been talks with the IMF and he couldn\u2019t have made this announcement without agreement. On the return of the inspectors, he said now the main agreements have been reached, it was just a practical question as to when they return: There is nothing withholding the mission going back, we have solved all the big issues. It is very important they go back. Comments on Greece at the eurogroup press conference from European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici: And the European Central Bank\u2019s Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9: (DSA is the debt sustainability analysis.) An agreement between Greece and its creditors on overarching reforms has been reached. Further work will continue in the coming days and inspectors will return to Athens as soon as possible, according to eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Dijsselbloem says the \u201cbig blocks\u201d have been sorted out. The eurogroup press conference will be transmitted live here when it starts. Well, that was quick: Here\u2019s our full story on Carney\u2019s speech: The Bank of England governor has made an impassioned plea for politicians not to give into protectionism on banking rules when negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the EU but to keep an open financial system. A week after prime minister Theresa May triggered article 50, formally beginning the process of the UK withdrawing from the EU, Mark Carney used a speech on the financial system to challenge those who want to cut the UK\u2019s access to the rest of Europe after Brexit. Highlighting what he believes is at stake if Brexit results in the City being cut off from the rest of Europe, Carney sought to portray London as a key part of the global financial system and reiterated his earlier claim that \u201cLondon is Europe\u2019s investment banker\u201d. He said that repair work to the financial system since the global crisis had made it safer, simpler and fairer and that the UK had gone beyond the minimum global standards, meaning others could others could rely on it as a \u201cpillar of strength for the international monetary and financial system\u201d. But describing Brexit negotiations as a \u201clitmus test for responsible financial globalisation\u201d, Carney suggested such gains were now at risk. \u201cA decade of hard fought financial reform creates enormous opportunities,\u201d Carney said in a speech in London\u2019s Canary Wharf financial district on Friday. \u201cIt is all too easy to give into protectionism, but the road less taken is often the most rewarding.\u201d There is question and answer session with Carney so there may well be questions about the morning\u2019s weak UK data and its impact on interest rate policy. The UK figures point to a slowdown in GDP growth, says Howard Archer of IHS Markit: A disappointing package of data for the UK economy which fuels suspicion that GDP growth slowed markedly, largely due to consumers becoming more cautious. We suspect UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 slowed to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 \u2013 this would be the weakest growth rate since the first quarter of 2016. Industrial production and (especially) construction output fell back appreciably in February while the trade deficit widened, admittedly partly due to erratic items lifting imports. There was some limited, much needed relief on the prices front as prices of imported traded goods dipped 0.9% month-on-month in February as sterling was modestly firmer and oil and commodity prices came off their highs. Even so, import prices were up 9.9% year-on-year. Britain\u2019s unseasonably warm weather in February is being partly blamed for the fall in industrial production. The Office for National Statistics said: The monthly decrease in electricity and gas was largely due to falls in both electricity generation and in the supply and distribution of gas and gaseous fuels; this was largely attributable to the temperature in February 2017 being 1.6 degrees Celsius warmer than average. Here\u2019s Reuters on the UK data: British industrial output fell unexpectedly in February and manufacturers struggled, according to official data on Friday that added to signs economic growth may have slowed as Britain prepares to leave the EU. Industrial output fell 0.7 percent in February, worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a 0.2 percent increase and following a 0.3 percent decline in January. Separate figures showed Britain\u2019s goods trade deficit unexpectedly hit a five-month high in February and January\u2019s deficit was revised up too, the Office for National Statistics said. Another batch of figures showing a slump in construction output chimed with recent business surveys that suggested Britain\u2019s economic performance probably peaked towards the end of last year. The latest ONS data suggested manufacturing was not making up for signs of a consumer spending slowdown as some economists had hoped following the pound\u2019s post-Brexit vote drop. Output in manufacturing, which accounts for about 10 percent of Britain\u2019s gross domestic product, unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent following a 1.0 percent fall in January, disappointing against forecasts for a 0.3 percent rise in the Reuters poll. There are also some poor UK construction figures, with output falling 1.7% month on month in February, the biggest drop in almost a year. Year on year, construction output rose just 0.5% compared to expectations of a 1.9% increase. Here\u2019s how the trade gap is widening, with the goods deficit unexpectedly hitting a five month high: Sterling has fallen back after the weak UK data, with the prospect of a change to the Bank of England\u2019s current low interest rate policy receding. The pound fell to $1.2429 against the dollar before recovering slightly to $1.2438, down 0.22%. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group said: UK\u2019s manufacturing and industrial production unexpectedly contracted for the second month in a row. Soft data revived the Bank of England doves and backed the idea that the inflation alone may not be a sufficient reason to raise the interest rates in the UK. BREAKING NEWS: Some disappointing numbers from the UK, with industrial production surprisingly falling by 0.7% month on month in February compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase and a 0.4% decline in January. The year on year rise was 2.8%, lower than the forecast 3.7%. Manufacturing output was also lower, down 0.1% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.3% rise. And the trade deficit is the widest since September 2016, with the global goods trade balance coming in at -\u00a312.461bn. Economists had been expecting a figure of -\u00a310.9bn. The Office for National Statistics said gold and aircraft erratic item imports pushed up the overall deficit. So far, and despite Russia saying the US air strike on Syria soured relations between the two superpowers, markets remain calm. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, down just 0.08% while most European markets are lower but not too dramatically so. And the US market seems to be shrugging off the conflict as well, to judge by the futures market: Signs of a slowdown in the UK housing market. UK house prices in the three months to March were 3.8% higher than a year ago, according to the Halifax, although this was down from the 5.1% figure recorded in February and was the lowest rate since May 2013. Prices were just 0.1% higher in March compared to the previous month, the lowest rate of change since October 2016. Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said: The annual rate of house price growth has more than halved over the past 12 months. A lengthy period of rapid house price growth has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home as income growth has failed to keep up, which appears to have curbed housing demand. Nonetheless, the supply of both new homes and existing properties available for sale remains low. This, together with historically very low mortgage rates, is likely to support house price levels over the coming months. Howard Archer at IHS Markit said: March\u2019s flat Halifax house price data - following on from lower Nationwide data and the Bank of England reporting a dip in mortgage approvals in February - fuels our belief that the housing market is being increasingly affected by the increasing squeeze on consumers and their concerns over the outlook. Markedly weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios are likely to weigh down on housing market activity and house prices. However, a shortage of supply is likely to put a floor under prices. Consequently, we believe house price gains over 2017 will be limited to no more than 2.5% - and there is a very real possibility that it could come in lower than that. Let\u2019s not forget that President Trump is also occupied with meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. According to Xinhau News Xi has said he is ready to work with Trump to boost China-US ties. As the eurogroup of finance ministers meet to discuss Greece, there seem to be some hopeful signs that an agreement could be on its way. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said ahead of the meeting that it has achieved results on Greece although there will not be a total political deal today. Although there is always at least one contrarian: As expected the uncertainty triggered by the US air strikes on Syria has sent European markets lower, but there is by no means panic. The FTSE 100 is currently down just 5 points or 0.06% .while France\u2019s Cac, Germany\u2019s Dax and Spain\u2019s Ibex opened 0.4% lower. The US may be in the headlines at the moment for the attack on Syria, but as mentioned previously, there is some key economic data out later in the form of the latest jobs figures. Analysts are expecting US non-farm payrolls to show a rise of 185,000, a drop from February\u2019s 235,000. But there is a chance the figure could be much higher, to judge from this week\u2019s private sector jobs data from ADP. That report showed a better than expected 263,000 number, and while the correlation with non-farms is not consistent, it could mean there could yet be a surprise on the cards. CMC\u2019s Hewson again: Over the last few months there hasn\u2019t been much more than a 50,000 gap between the two since October last year, which suggests that we\u2019ll likely see a fairly strong number above 200,000, maybe in the region of 230,000. The wages figure will also be widely watched, since that is an important element in the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking when it comes to interest rate decisions. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to authorise airstrikes on Syria after this week\u2019s chemical attack has understandably spooked markets. With growing tensions between the US and China over North Korea after the country launched another missile this week, signs that the US could also be at odds with Russia over Syria has added to the unease. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Today\u2019s military action against Syrian airfields after this week\u2019s chemical gas attack, shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise after Secretary of State Tillerson\u2019s remarks that recent events required a \u201cserious response\u201d however the timing was, coming so quickly afterwards. The action adds a complexity to geopolitics that wasn\u2019t there before given Russia\u2019s support for Syria and Trumps pre-election pledges to try and repair relations with Putin. The US would now appear to be on a collision course with Russia as Tillerson went on to add that there was no prospect that Assad could remain Syria\u2019s leader in light of the use of chemical weapons, and markets in Europe are likely to reflect this escalation in tensions with a lower open and higher gold prices as safe haven assets attract capital flows. Gold added more than 1% to $1264 an ounce, its highest level since November, while Brent crude jumped 2% to a one month high on concerns that growing military action could hit supplies. But with the US suggesting the Syria move was a one off, some of the early knee-jerk reaction has abated, and Brent is currently 1% higher at $55.54 a barrel. Japan\u2019s Nikkei reversed its initial losses to close up 0.4%, while European markets are expected to open only slightly lower.

The ongoing currency weakness created by Brexit, coupled with rising oil prices has elevated inflation above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, with speculation mounting over CPI following its positive trajectory this quarter. Although the immediate market reaction to March\u2019s headline CPI reading was noticeably bullish, gains may be relinquished when participants start to re-evaluate the impact it may have on the UK economy. With inflation still above average earning there is a threat of consumer spending taking a hit, which could spark concerns over the longevity of the UK\u2019s consumer-fuelled economic growth. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ecb89ce4b05776df18ca35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T11:07:44.419Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Should the Bank of England raise interest rates? The answer is complicated, writes Larry Elliott:</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems so obvious. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England</a> sets interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-inflation-rate-stays-three-year-high\">Inflation is currently 2.3% and \u2013 despite holding steady in March \u2013 is certain to go higher over the coming months</a>. Higher borrowing costs choke off inflationary pressure. Therefore interest rates should now be going up.</p> <p>In reality, it is a bit more complicated than that. The first thing the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee have to decide is whether the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/mar2017\">above-target inflation </a>seen in the last couple of months is a temporary blip. It\u2019s quite clear it isn\u2019t. Food is going up, energy companies are raising their tariffs, retailers are passing on the higher costs of imports caused by a weaker pound.</p> <p>Last month\u2019s inflation figure was flattered by the timing of Easter, which led to a sharp fall in the annual cost of air fares. That one-off factor will be reversed in April. The question is not whether inflation will continue rising in 2017 but how high it will go. At least to 3% is the answer, perhaps a bit higher.</p> <p>The next thing for the MPC to consider is whether there is a risk of inflation becoming entrenched. That would happen if rising prices led to workers successfully negotiating higher wages to compensate them for the hit to living standards. There seems little sign that inflation will feed on itself, as it did in the 1970s.</p> </blockquote> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-inflation-only-going-up-lets-hope-interest-rates-dont-follow\">Inflation is only going one way.

Having been depressed for multiple years by a fierce price war, supermarket prices have been increasing fairly rapidly as the near-20% depreciation in sterling since November 2015 pushes up costs. At 1.2%, the annual rate of growth in food &amp; non-alcoholic drink prices is the highest since early 2014.</p> <p>That said, there was a risk that last year\u2019s early Easter provided a temporary drag on today\u2019s data, as items such as air fares would have been lower than had there been a holiday weekend. But at first glance, this effect appears to be fairly limited.</p> <p>Overall, we think that the effect of the weaker pound and higher fuel costs will drive inflation above 3% in the second half of this year...In tomorrow\u2019s jobs report, we expect wage growth (excluding bonuses) to fall back to 2% following some particularly weak \u201csingle month\u201d figures recently. In real terms, that means that disposable incomes will be falling, and we are seeing some signs that this is hitting spending.</p> <h2><strong>Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce: </strong></h2> <p>The continued elevation in costs at the factory gate suggests that consumer prices are likely to resume their upward trend in the coming months.<br></p> <p>Businesses say they are facing an uphill struggle to absorb the increasing cost of imports \u2013 a task made more difficult by the raft of additional upfront costs imposed on businesses at the start of the new tax year. As a result, the rising price of imported raw materials are expected to increasingly filter through into higher prices, stifling consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth.</p> <p>It is probable that rising inflation helped weaken UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017, with growth likely to have slowed to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The UK\u2019s growth prospects are expected to remain subdued over the near term, as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers and businesses. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, it is vital that government does more to ease the cost pressures facing firms by tackling the burden of upfront costs and taxes associated with doing business in the UK. The MPC must also continue to \u2018look through\u2019 the expected rises in inflation and opt for an extended period of monetary stability. This will help businesses to continue to invest, recruit and support the wider economy.</p> <h2><strong>Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management:</strong></h2> <p>The later date of Easter this year will have held back prices in March, thanks to the lower air fares. However, while the impact of rising oil prices last year is now fading, the full impact of sterling\u2019s devaluation is still feeding through. We would expect the air fare effect to reverse next month, and CPI to move higher, further above the 2% target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2017-04-11T08:49:13/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Inflation\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2017-04-11T08:49:13/embed.html\">Inflation</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ec9afde4b05776df18c9b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T09:01:15.367Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the TUC on the inflation figures.

With price rises outstripping wages, we are getting progressively poorer each month. Unsurprisingly, consumers are choosing to instead focus their spending on essential items like food and fuel. Changing shopping habits and a fall in spending should flash amber warning lights for an economy reliant on confident consumers hitting the shops.</p> <p>Rising inflation also has implications for savers, investors and retirees as it erodes the spending power of future interest and dividend payments and eats away at the worth of your original capital.</p> <p>Inflation never looks like a problem, until suddenly it is a big problem. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u2019 feel the pain, companies don\u2019t invest and the market gets worried.</p> <h2>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com:</h2> <p>Inflation remained above the two percent mark in March, stoking fears that consumer spending \u2013 the engine room of the UK economy \u2013 could begin to slip.</p> <p>Theresa May will be concerned that the sharp fall in sterling over recent months, combined with rising food and fuel costs, is beginning to squeeze living standards.</p> <p>But of even greater concern is the impact this could have on the UK economy during Brexit negotiations. With inflation now beyond the Bank of England\u2019s target, it would not be a surprise to see interest rates hiked sooner rather than later to keep prices in check.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade:</strong></h2> <p>The UK\u2019s consumer price index remains some way above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, though Mark Carney and Co may be somewhat relieved to see that prices haven\u2019t continued to rise.</p> <p>It marks temporary respite from soaring inflation following the post-Brexit collapse of the pound, with a late Easter and fuel prices being partly responsible for the pause.</p> <p>Despite March\u2019s plateau, inflation could pick up again as we head into the second half of 2017, and could even exceed 3% by the summer. Whether that forces the MPC\u2019s hand is still unsure, though - many will want to see unemployment down and wage growth markedly up before an interest rate hike.</p> <h2>Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon: </h2> <p>With inflation surpassing the Bank of England\u2019s target for a second month running savers will begin to feel the pinch as inflation erodes the value of their hard earned cash and this poses a particular threat to pensioner income.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit:</h2> <p>Some respite for consumers \u2013 and the Bank of England \u2013 as consumer price inflation stabilized at 2.3% in March after rising sharply from 0.9% in October.</p> <p>Unfortunately though, it is odds-on that this will prove only a temporary respite on the inflation front. Inflation was held down in March by Easter-related pricing distortions. Specifically, Easter related price hikes (notably on air and sea transport, package holidays, hotels) occurred in March in 2016 but are occurring in April this year.</p> <p>Consumers are facing a serious squeeze as higher inflation is occurring in tandem with muted earnings growth - and this looks set to bite even harder over the coming months.</p> <p>It is evident that the Bank of England has recently become more concerned about the potential inflation overshoot but we still expect interest rates to remain at 0.25% through 2017 and 2018 at least. We suspect that any Bank of England temptation to raise interest rates will be tempered by mounting evidence of a slowing UK economy as consumers rein in their spending and business caution mounts. Likely ongoing muted earnings growth is also seen encouraging the Bank of England to sit tight on interest rates.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T08:52:07.337Z\">at 9.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58ec96d6e4b05776df18c9a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T08:43:43.903Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rising inflation which is outpacing wage growth puts pressure on household incomes of course, something the Treasury seems aware of in its response to this latest data.

                "bodyText":"Here\u2019s a round up of the day\u2019s events. UK inflation was flat, with the consumer price index coming in at 2.3% in March for the second month in a row. That was still the highest level for more than three years, and raises the question of whether the Bank of England should raise interest rates. But with wage growth slowing, real incomes are being hit. UK house prices rose by 5.8% in February but London saw its slowest growth since April 2012. Elsewhere a leading investment group has described the actions of Barclays boss Jes Staley in trying to unmask a whistleblower as \u201camazing\u201d in the light of attempts to encourage people with concerns to come forward. German economic sentiment improved in April but eurozone industrial production was disappointing. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The pound is currently up 0.25% at $1.2441, having been as high as $1.2445 and as low as $1.2404. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga said: Sterling was volatile on Tuesday, with prices oscillating between losses and gains after markets digested the UK\u2019s steady 2.3% inflation figure for March, which was the highest level since September 2013. The ongoing currency weakness created by Brexit, coupled with rising oil prices has elevated inflation above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, with speculation mounting over CPI following its positive trajectory this quarter. Although the immediate market reaction to March\u2019s headline CPI reading was noticeably bullish, gains may be relinquished when participants start to re-evaluate the impact it may have on the UK economy. With inflation still above average earning there is a threat of consumer spending taking a hit, which could spark concerns over the longevity of the UK\u2019s consumer-fuelled economic growth. Should the Bank of England raise interest rates? The answer is complicated, writes Larry Elliott: It seems so obvious. The Bank of England sets interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. Inflation is currently 2.3% and \u2013 despite holding steady in March \u2013 is certain to go higher over the coming months. Higher borrowing costs choke off inflationary pressure. Therefore interest rates should now be going up. In reality, it is a bit more complicated than that. The first thing the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee have to decide is whether the above-target inflation seen in the last couple of months is a temporary blip. It\u2019s quite clear it isn\u2019t. Food is going up, energy companies are raising their tariffs, retailers are passing on the higher costs of imports caused by a weaker pound. Last month\u2019s inflation figure was flattered by the timing of Easter, which led to a sharp fall in the annual cost of air fares. That one-off factor will be reversed in April. The question is not whether inflation will continue rising in 2017 but how high it will go. At least to 3% is the answer, perhaps a bit higher. The next thing for the MPC to consider is whether there is a risk of inflation becoming entrenched. That would happen if rising prices led to workers successfully negotiating higher wages to compensate them for the hit to living standards. There seems little sign that inflation will feed on itself, as it did in the 1970s. His full analysis is here: Here\u2019s our report on the inflation figures: Rising food and clothing prices kept Britain\u2019s inflation rate at its highest level for more than three years last month, putting household budgets under pressure as the Brexit effect on the pound worked its way through the economy. Official figures put inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) at 2.3% for the second month running in March, in line with economists\u2019 forecasts, as food prices rose at the fastest pace for three years, increasing 1.2% on the year. Economists said inflation was likely to push higher in April and they warned the rising costs of essentials such as groceries were already eating into households\u2019 budgets and leaving them with less cash to spend on other items. Reports from retailers suggest sales have slowed in recent months. \u201cToday\u2019s release confirms our expectations that 2017 will see the end of the consumer spending boom which has driven economic growth in recent years,\u201d said Nina Skero at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cWith the prices of essentials such as housing costs, food and transport on the rise, less money will be left over for discretionary spending. This is especially true given that wage growth is unlikely to keep up with the elevated inflation levels.\u201d The full story is here: With the pound now fairly flat against the dollar in the wake of the inflation numbers, the FTSE 100 is pretty buoyant, up 44 points or 0.6%. The host of overseas earners in the UK\u2019s leading index are supported by a weaker sterling, and the fact the currency has moved no higher has been taken positively by investors. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: While the pound was clearly disappointed that the CPI didn\u2019t grow any further in March, the fact that it avoided the dip forecast by analysts meant the currency\u2019s losses weren\u2019t too pronounced. Against the euro sterling fell 0.2%, shuffling under 1.17 in the process; against the dollar, however, the pound sat flat, keeping its head just above 1.24. Though the pound didn\u2019t have an aggressively sour reaction to the inflation figure, the fact that it didn\u2019t move any higher was enough to lift the FTSE, which surged more than half a percent to hit a 3 week high. The Eurozone indices, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t shake their negative open, the DAX and CAC slipping 0.3% and 0.1% respectively. The region was aided, however, by a pair of better than expected ZEW economic sentiment readings; the German figure came in at a 20 month high of 19.5, while the Eurozone-wide hit a 16 month peak of 26.3. UK house prices rose by 5.8% year on year in February compared to 5.3% the previous month, with London showing the slowest increase since April 2012 at 3.7%. The UK figure is still below the average annual house price growth of 7.3% seen in 2016. The Office for National Statistics said: The main contribution to the increase in UK house prices came from England, where house prices increased by 6.3% over the year to February 2017, with the average price in England now \u00a3234,000. Wales saw house prices increase by 1.8% over the last 12 months to stand at \u00a3145,000. In Scotland, the average price increased by 3.1% over the year to stand at \u00a3139,000. The average price in Northern Ireland currently stands at \u00a3125,000, an increase of 5.7% over the last 12 months. The forthcoming French presidential election is causing some tremors for the euro: Arnaud Masset at Swissquote Bank said: The single currency has held up so far but investors are becoming particularly worried ahead of April 23rd (the first round of the French election). Back with UK inflation, and there is one category of consumer who is being particularly hard hit by price rises, points out Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: In March food inflation really took off, which suggests the supermarkets are now starting to pass rising import costs onto consumers. Crisps and margarine saw particularly steep price rises, not good news for fans of the crisp sandwich. He added: The inflationary squeeze that\u2019s coming is going to mean consumers have to spend more at the check outs and petrol pumps, and that reduces their capacity to fund discretionary spending. It also reduces people\u2019s propensity to save, which is particularly worrying at a time when the UK\u2019s savings ratio is at its lowest level since the 1960s, and retirement is costlier than ever because of gains in life expectancy. Away from UK inflation, and German consumers remain confident it seems. The ZEW Institute\u2019s economic sentiment index came in at 19.5 in April compared to 12.8 the previous month and expectations of a figure of 14. This was the highest level since August 2015. ZEW president Achim Wambach said: Though the long-term average as calculated from the beginning of the survey (December 1991) is yet to be beaten, these results are comparable to the expectations prior to the Brexit vote in June 2016. The German economic situation has proved fairly robust in the first quarter. This is highlighted by the solid figures for growth in industrial production, the construction sector and retail sales from February. In addition, the consistently high labour demand has boosted private consumption. The financial market experts expect this positive development to continue. However there have also been some disappointing eurozone industrial production figures: More reaction: James Smith, ING Bank economist: UK inflation stayed at 2.3% year on year in March, which when compared to wage growth (which is likely to slow in data released tomorrow), means real incomes could be starting to fall. A major driver of the recent pick-up in inflation has been food prices. Having been depressed for multiple years by a fierce price war, supermarket prices have been increasing fairly rapidly as the near-20% depreciation in sterling since November 2015 pushes up costs. At 1.2%, the annual rate of growth in food &amp; non-alcoholic drink prices is the highest since early 2014. That said, there was a risk that last year\u2019s early Easter provided a temporary drag on today\u2019s data, as items such as air fares would have been lower than had there been a holiday weekend. But at first glance, this effect appears to be fairly limited. Overall, we think that the effect of the weaker pound and higher fuel costs will drive inflation above 3% in the second half of this year...In tomorrow\u2019s jobs report, we expect wage growth (excluding bonuses) to fall back to 2% following some particularly weak \u201csingle month\u201d figures recently. In real terms, that means that disposable incomes will be falling, and we are seeing some signs that this is hitting spending. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce: The continued elevation in costs at the factory gate suggests that consumer prices are likely to resume their upward trend in the coming months. Businesses say they are facing an uphill struggle to absorb the increasing cost of imports \u2013 a task made more difficult by the raft of additional upfront costs imposed on businesses at the start of the new tax year. As a result, the rising price of imported raw materials are expected to increasingly filter through into higher prices, stifling consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth. It is probable that rising inflation helped weaken UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017, with growth likely to have slowed to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The UK\u2019s growth prospects are expected to remain subdued over the near term, as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers and businesses. Against this backdrop, it is vital that government does more to ease the cost pressures facing firms by tackling the burden of upfront costs and taxes associated with doing business in the UK. The MPC must also continue to \u2018look through\u2019 the expected rises in inflation and opt for an extended period of monetary stability. This will help businesses to continue to invest, recruit and support the wider economy. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: The later date of Easter this year will have held back prices in March, thanks to the lower air fares. However, while the impact of rising oil prices last year is now fading, the full impact of sterling\u2019s devaluation is still feeding through. We would expect the air fare effect to reverse next month, and CPI to move higher, further above the 2% target. And here\u2019s the TUC on the inflation figures. General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: Rising prices and sluggish pay increases mean that real earnings growth has now ground to a halt. Without government action, another living standards crisis is on the cards. We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Retail sales figures from the British Retail Consortium released overnight showed that the rise in inflation is already starting to bite, with non-food high street sales suffering the worst fall in nearly six years. With price rises outstripping wages, we are getting progressively poorer each month. Unsurprisingly, consumers are choosing to instead focus their spending on essential items like food and fuel. Changing shopping habits and a fall in spending should flash amber warning lights for an economy reliant on confident consumers hitting the shops. Rising inflation also has implications for savers, investors and retirees as it erodes the spending power of future interest and dividend payments and eats away at the worth of your original capital. Inflation never looks like a problem, until suddenly it is a big problem. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u2019 feel the pain, companies don\u2019t invest and the market gets worried. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: Inflation remained above the two percent mark in March, stoking fears that consumer spending \u2013 the engine room of the UK economy \u2013 could begin to slip. Theresa May will be concerned that the sharp fall in sterling over recent months, combined with rising food and fuel costs, is beginning to squeeze living standards. But of even greater concern is the impact this could have on the UK economy during Brexit negotiations. With inflation now beyond the Bank of England\u2019s target, it would not be a surprise to see interest rates hiked sooner rather than later to keep prices in check. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade: The UK\u2019s consumer price index remains some way above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, though Mark Carney and Co may be somewhat relieved to see that prices haven\u2019t continued to rise. It marks temporary respite from soaring inflation following the post-Brexit collapse of the pound, with a late Easter and fuel prices being partly responsible for the pause. Despite March\u2019s plateau, inflation could pick up again as we head into the second half of 2017, and could even exceed 3% by the summer. Whether that forces the MPC\u2019s hand is still unsure, though - many will want to see unemployment down and wage growth markedly up before an interest rate hike. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon: With inflation surpassing the Bank of England\u2019s target for a second month running savers will begin to feel the pinch as inflation erodes the value of their hard earned cash and this poses a particular threat to pensioner income. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit: Some respite for consumers \u2013 and the Bank of England \u2013 as consumer price inflation stabilized at 2.3% in March after rising sharply from 0.9% in October. Unfortunately though, it is odds-on that this will prove only a temporary respite on the inflation front. Inflation was held down in March by Easter-related pricing distortions. Specifically, Easter related price hikes (notably on air and sea transport, package holidays, hotels) occurred in March in 2016 but are occurring in April this year. Consumers are facing a serious squeeze as higher inflation is occurring in tandem with muted earnings growth - and this looks set to bite even harder over the coming months. It is evident that the Bank of England has recently become more concerned about the potential inflation overshoot but we still expect interest rates to remain at 0.25% through 2017 and 2018 at least. We suspect that any Bank of England temptation to raise interest rates will be tempered by mounting evidence of a slowing UK economy as consumers rein in their spending and business caution mounts. Likely ongoing muted earnings growth is also seen encouraging the Bank of England to sit tight on interest rates. Rising inflation which is outpacing wage growth puts pressure on household incomes of course, something the Treasury seems aware of in its response to this latest data. A spokesperson said: We are building an economy that works for everyone and helping families with the cost of living by cutting income taxes for 31 million people, freezing fuel duty and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00a37.50 per hour. The pound, initially down on the inflation figures, is now at a day\u2019s high of $1.2446 against the dollar. Rising prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear, miscellaneous goods and services were largely offset by falls in transport costs, notably air fares, according to the Office for National Statistics. The later timing of Easter had an influence here. The ONS said: The timing of Easter in March 2016 contributed to air fares rising by 22.9% on the month whereas this year, Easter is in April and there was no price rise. Instead fares fell by 3.9% between February and March. BREAKING NEWS UK consumer price inflation - the Bank of England\u2019s preferred measure - has come in at 2.3% year on year in March, the same as the previous month and in line with expectations. This remains the highest year on year level since September 2013. Month on month the rise was 0.4%. More on the news on Monday that Barclays chief executive Jes Staley had attempted to unmask a whistleblower despite being warned not to, and is facing an investigation by regulators. Thomas Moore, investment director at Standard Life Investments told the BBC Today programme that the timing of Staley\u2019s actions was \u201camazing\u201d given that only last year the Financial Conduct Authority issued a report saying it wanted to encourage a culture where whistleblowers could come forward without fear of reprisals. Can Staley survive in his job? Moore says much will depend on the outcome of the regulatory investigation: \u201cThe tone is set by the top of the organisation. If you go to Barclays\u2019 Canary Wharf headquarters you are surrounded by the word \u2018integrity\u2019. \u201cSo it is disappointing when the chief executive is told not to pursue this individual and he continued to chase this individual.\u201d Moore said the issue was a key one for investors: \u201cBanks who behaved badly have the lowest [stock market] valuations.\u201d If you want to follow events as they unfolded on Monday, our live blog is here: Shares in JD Sports Fashion have hit a new all time high after it unveiled record full year profits. They jumped as high as 425p in the immediate wake of the figures and are currently up 4% at 424p. Reuters reports: Britain\u2019s JD Sports Fashion Plc posted a 55 percent rise in full-year headline pretax profit as demand for leisurewear products remained firm. JD Sports, which alongside its core sports retail business runs fashion and outdoor retail outlets such as Scotts and Blacks, said headline profit before tax and exceptional items rose to a record 244.8 million pounds from 157.1 million a year earlier. Like-for-like store sales at its core sports fashion business rose 10 percent but the company said it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d to expect like-for-like sales growth to be maintained at this level. The company, which rivals Mike Ashley-owned Sports Direct in Britain, warned that external influences, such as inflationary pressures arising from Brexit, may impact trading in the latter part of the year. Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard said: The results are an example of what the right product, well merchandised can achieve in the current environment and, whilst the trainer trend tailwind has been off the Beaufort scale, JD has sailed it skilfully. Both sports fashion and outdoor exceeded expectations. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Eurozone indices fell sharply this Tuesday, the DAX and CAC each dropping half a percent. It appears that the current global political tensions, namely those between the US and Syria/Russia, as well as North Korea, have spooked investors, the FTSE perhaps only avoiding the same level of losses due to the impending inflation update. As expected, investors are taking a cautious view in the wake of growing geo-political tensions. Those investors who are around, that is, given that trading is likely to be fairly quiet in the run-up to the Easter break. The FTSE 100 has fallen around 10 points or 0.1% while France\u2019s Cac has opened 0.5% lower, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.4% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.6% lower. On the currency markets the pound is flat against the dollar at $1.2411 and upu 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1732. Elsewhere Brent crude has slipped 0.36% to $55.78 a barrel despite the global uncertainty while gold is up $2 to $1256 an ounce. Adding to the general uncertainty is the US Federal Reserve, which recently said it could begin selling off assets bought following the financial crisis, as well as raising interest rates further this year. On Monday Fed chair Janet Yellen made positive noises on the US economy, adding to the feeling that the central bank will continue moving away from its stimulus programme. Reuters reports: The Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to raise U.S. interest rates gradually are aimed at sustaining full employment and near-2-percent inflation without letting the economy overheat, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Monday. \u201cI think we have a healthy economy now,\u201d Yellen said at an event at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy in Ann Arbor. Unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is now a little bit below the jobless rate that most Fed officials think signals full employment, and inflation is \u201creasonably close\u201d to the Fed\u2019s 2-percent goal, she said. With the economy expected to continue to grow at a moderate pace, she said, the Fed is now shifting its focus. \u201cWhereas before we had our foot pressed down on the gas pedal trying to give the economy all the oomph we possibly could, now allowing the economy to kind of coast and remain on an even keel -- to give it some gas but not so much that we are pressing down hard on the accelerator -- that\u2019s a better stance of monetary policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be ahead of the curve and not behind it.\u201d In the U.S. Treasury bond market, yields were little changed after Yellen\u2019s remarks. The Fed raised rates in March for only the third time since the Great Recession, and most Fed officials expect the central bank to raise rates at least two more times this year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are back in nervous mode, with a number of political concerns to worry investors. The US attack on Syria has increased the global uncertainty, and on top of that there are increasing tensions between President Trump\u2019s administration and North Korea. In Europe the French presidential race continues to dominate the agenda. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Flight to safety continues, as geopolitical concerns occupy the global headlines with North Korea\u2019s missile tests, US\u2019 strike on Syria and Jean-Luc Melonchon gaining support in the French election race... According to one Kantar poll, Melonchon advanced to the third place, taking lead over Francois Fillon. Political risks could encourage a further slide in the euro. So the Nikkei has closed down 0.27% and European markets are expected to open slightly lower: On the economic front, the latest UK inflation figures are in focus, and are expected once again to come in above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Many analysts are forecasting a figure of 2.3% in March, flat on the previous month although some believe there could be a slight dip. Unicredit said: We see headline CPI inflation easing to 2.1% year on year in March from 2.3% year on year in the previous month, and core inflation down by 0.3 percentage points to 1.7% year on year. The later timing of Easter this year and a negative contribution from motor fuel prices is likely to more than offset substantial price rises by some of the Big 6 UK energy suppliers. Here\u2019s our preview of what to expect: German confidence figures are also due later and, on the corporate front, we have figures from JD Sports.",

(The FTSE is down 0.5% at 7,311.). Shares in Royal Mail were up almost 2% earlier.</p> <p><strong>Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at </strong><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown, gives his take on the plans:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shares in Royal Mail were up 1.9% this morning after the group finally announced it will be shutting its existing pension plan.

Slamming the International Monetary Fund for the delays that have stalled bailout negotiations for close to a year, Tsipras said extra pension cuts and tax rises demanded by creditors once Athens\u2019 current bailout expires next year would be legislated in the next 15 days. Discussions on medium term debt relief \u2013 viewed by many as essential for the recession-ravaged Greek economy to finally rebound - would take place at the IMF\u2019s spring meeting next week, giving Athens a sense of what might be in store. The Greek prime minister, who says implementation of reforms depends on debt relief, also predicted an emergency summit of eurozone finance ministers in early May, once technical teams had completed a review in Athens where a deal would be finalised. If that happened, the country could be given access to the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme which would help Greece return to bond markets. The squeeze on real incomes in the UK shouldn\u2019t be too severe according to analysts at Capital Economics. It follows official figures on Wednesday which showed inflation outpaced regular pay growth (excluding bonuses) for the first time in two-and-a-half years in February. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: After two-and-a-half years of rising real wages, this week\u2019s inflation and labour market figures confirmed that the pay squeeze has returned. And, with inflation rising faster than expected, some further drop in real earnings looks likely over the coming months. However, the squeeze shouldn\u2019t be as sharp or prolonged as that seen after the financial crisis, and there are other reasons to think that spending growth might hold up rather better this time around. For a start, the labour market still appears to be tightening and we remain optimistic that this should result in at least some pick-up in nominal wage growth this year. And we think inflation should peak towards the end of this year, while nominal wage growth continues to accelerate slowly, paving the way for a faster increase in real earnings next year. Brent crude is up 0.2% at $55.97 a barrel after the International Energy Agency said global demand for oil is close to outstripping supply after nearly three years of surplus production. Oil stocks across the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development fell by 17.2m barrels in March, the IEA said. Paresh Davdra, chief executive and co-founder of RationalFX, says the pound is increasingly at the mercy of developments in other markets: Whilst the pound was once driven by political sentiment over Brexit before Article 50, it now seems more overtly driven by the fortunes of its major peers, achieving strong runs on the back of weakness in the dollar and the euro. This could make for volatile or inconsistent movement for the currency should the dollar or euro prove vulnerable to political drivers which, thus far, appears highly likely. Although being driven by risks in other markets has its benefits, investors will be hoping that the pound is able to gain independently of other currencies in the long term, particularly as the Brexit process progresses. The pound is just about holding on to gains against the dollar - currently at $1.2540 - in what has been a decent week for sterling: It\u2019s all relative though. On 23 June, the day of the EU referendum and before the Brexit vote was known, one pound would buy about $1.49: Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says the Bank of England will be pleased by signs that lenders are making it tougher for consumers to borrow. If the fundamentals for consumers do weaken further as expected over the coming months, it is vital that banks adopt tight lending standards in granting unsecured consumer credit, or it risks causing serious debt problems for the economy. The Bank of England has clearly become more worried about consumer borrowing and debt levels in recent months. This was highlighted by the households savings ratio falling to a record low of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Governor Mark Carney has also indicated that the Bank of England will closely monitor consumer dynamics over the coming months and it will be a major factor in their monetary policy decisions. More British lenders plan to tighten the supply of credit to consumers than at any time since the 2008/09 financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the latest quarterly credit conditions survey from the Bank of England, which found that a net balance of 18.8% of lenders expect to rein in supply over the next three months, up from 7.9% in the previous survey. It was the highest proportion since the end of 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed tipping the global economy into crisis. Britain\u2019s economic growth since the financial crisis has been fuelled by consumer spending, and the Bank had already flagged concerns that households will take on more debt to sustain spending as inflation rises and wage growth slows. The survey on Thursday also showed weaker business investment acted as a \u201csignificant drag\u201d on demand for credit among UK businesses. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, says it is concerned by Royal Mail\u2019s pension closure and will be studying the implications. Brian Scott, Unite officer for the Royal Mail: This is a cause for serious concern for a hardworking and dedicated workforce. We will study the implications of today\u2019s announcement very carefully and consider all the options going forward. If we don\u2019t achieve a satisfactory outcome, we can\u2019t rule out an industrial action ballot on this issue. We will be consulting our members closely on the next steps in the coming days and weeks.\u201d Royal Mail has responded to the threat of strike action by the Communication Workers Union, which has condemned the company\u2019s decision to close its defined benefit pension scheme. A spokesperson for Royal Mail said: Customers choose Royal Mail because they trust us to deliver. Any industrial action \u2013 or threat of it \u2013 undermines this trust between Royal Mail and our customers, and we could lose business as a result. The CWU said workers on average face losing up to a third of their future pensions. For a 50 year-old worker earning \u00a325,000 a year and retiring at 65, it would equate to a loss of \u00a34,392 a year (\u00a3109,800 over 25 years), the union calculated. Royal Mail responded: Under our proposal, only a very small percentage would see this level of reduction in their pension. If members leave Royal Mail employment before that age, the impact on their benefits would be smaller. The plan has around 90,000 members. The impact of the proposed changes will vary from member to member. For plan members close to retirement, we expect the changes to have a smaller effect. The impact of the proposed changes will depend on age, length of service and which part of the scheme a member is in. We know how important pension benefits are to our colleagues. We continue to work closely with our unions on a sustainable and affordable solution for the provision of future pension benefits. We will write to plan members once further decisions have been made. Investors appear to have welcomed the news that Royal Mail plans to close its defined benefit pensions scheme. Shares are up 0.8% at 422.5p, making it one of the FTSE\u2019s top risers. (The FTSE is down 0.5% at 7,311.). Shares in Royal Mail were up almost 2% earlier. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, gives his take on the plans: Shares in Royal Mail were up 1.9% this morning after the group finally announced it will be shutting its existing pension plan. Despite the scheme currently running a surplus, an impending review of company contributions has been hanging over the group for some time. Royal Mail\u2019s current contributions to this scheme alone are about 10% of total salary costs, including wages of staff who are not members of the scheme. These were expected to more than double to over \u00a31bn in 2018, equivalent to around 25% of the group\u2019s entire 2015/16 UK wage bill. However, with a highly unionised workforce, which has in the past shown itself willing to flex its muscle in defence members\u2019 rights, introducing an alternative plan is likely to prove costly. Whether those costs will be in the form of chunky employer contributions to a new defined contribution scheme or lost revenue from industrial action remains to be seen. The Communication Workers Union is threatening strike action over Royal Mail\u2019s decision to close its defined benefit pension scheme in 2018. The union said it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the move, which it says would cost the average worker a third of their future pension. Ray Ellis, acting deputy general secretary for postal workers at the CWU said the views of workers had been ignored: Although Royal Mail\u2019s own consultation exercise revealed massive opposition to its closure plan, the company has decided to ignore the views of its workforce and proceed with closure without consent. CWU has made clear that any attempt by the company to impose change without agreement will be met with the strongest possible opposition including a ballot for industrial action. We will not stand by and watch the company abandon the pension promises it made at the time of privatisation which threatens our members with massive cuts to their future pension benefits and insecurity and poverty in retirement. The CWU represents about 195,000 members in post, telecoms, mobile and financial services companies including Royal Mail, Post Office, BT, EE, O2 and Santander. Corporate news is a little thin on the ground this morning but Royal Mail has confirmed the closure of its defined benefit pension scheme. Julia Kollewe reports: Royal Mail has announced that it will close its 90,000 member pension fund after consulting members and unions, even though the scheme in surplus. It argues that the surplus would run out next year and the scheme would become unaffordable. The company, which was privatised in 2013, currently pays \u00a3400m a year into the fund but it says this could more than double to over \u00a31bn in 2018. The \u00a37.4bn defined-benefit scheme guarantees a pension based on a postal worker\u2019s average salary, and it is thought that Royal Mail will replace it with a less generous defined contribution scheme. The company said: We have concluded that there is no affordable solution to keeping the plan open in its current form. Therefore, the company has come to the decision that the plan will close to future accrual on 31 March 2018, subject to trustee approval. We know how important pension benefits are to our colleagues. We continue to work closely with our unions on a sustainable and affordable solution for the provision of future pension benefits. Major European markets have followed Wall Street and Asia lower this morning. The scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 7,315 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 12,130 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 5,075 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 19,899 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 10,321 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 380 The weaker dollar is contributing to the fall in equities, as Spreadex\u2019s Connor Campbell explains: The pound obviously relished Trump\u2019s comments, climbing another half a percent in what has already been a very strong week for the currency. This in turn dragged the FTSE lower, the UK index dropping 45 points with the majority of its commodity and banking stocks also in the red. The eurozone indices suffered the same fate, the DAX and CAC falling by 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. That\u2019s because the euro was an even bigger beneficiary of the dollar-situation, rising 0.6% against the US currency to hit a one week peak. Regardless of whether this selloff has been overdone or not, there is little on the economic calendar to displace it from the forefront of investors\u2019 minds, meaning the dollar may struggle to regain its footing until this afternoon\u2019s US session at the very earliest. Elsa Lignos, global head of currency strategy for RBC Capital Markets, says the reaction in the FX markets to Trump\u2019s comments could well be short-lived. Typically, politicians\u2019 currency comments have no lasting effect\u2014the kneejerk reaction may be 50\u2013100pts but it quickly fades. The comments would have more lasting power if they drive Trump to openly look for a dove to replace Yellen, though her term is not up until October 2018. Trump softened his tone on China during the interview with the Wall Street Journal. Having previously branded Beijing the \u201cgrand champion\u201d of currency manipulation, the President said he\u2019d changed his mind: They\u2019re not currency manipulators. The President also refused to rule out a second term for the Fed chair Janet Yellen, despite saying on the campaign trail that she would not be reappointed. He said it was still \u201cvery early\u201d and that she was \u201cnot toast\u201d. I like her, I respect her. It\u2019s very early. Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management in New York said the dollar sell-off following Trump\u2019s comments was probably an overreaction: The market had a big reaction, but I think it was an overreaction. He may just be hedging his bets by making sure that the American public realises he\u2019s not backing down on trade. The pound is up against both the dollar and the euro this morning. Sterling is up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2548, and 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1778. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is back above $1.25 following a warning from President Trump that the dollar \u201cis getting too strong\u201d because people have confidence in him. He told the Wall Street Journal: I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that\u2019s my fault because people have confidence in me. But that\u2019s hurting -- that will hurt ultimately. Look, there\u2019s some very good things about a strong dollar, but usually speaking the best thing about it is that it sounds good. It\u2019s very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency. The President also suggested he would like the Federal Reserve to keep US interest rates low: I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you. The comments sent the dollar index - which tracks the US dollar against six major currencies - to its lowest level since 30 March.",

Pro-EU Tory MPs will not defy May\u2019s line during the election. They are therefore much less likely to fight for soft Brexit once she has won a mandate. The Lords, however, will still have a soft Brexit majority. Peers will still apply pressure to May but without backing in the Commons the unelected second chamber will be powerless to halt a hard Brexit. </p> <p>An election will therefore strengthen May\u2019s hand in the Brexit negotiations. The EU27 would arguably also have to treat her with more respect\u2014not someone who, as Nicola Sturgeon recently reminded May, had never won an election as leader.</p> <p>May wants an EU deal. The extra freedom that an election win would give her will also give her more room to make the concessions she has recently signalled\u2014on the divorce bill; and freedom of movement and the ECJ\u2019s remit during a transitional period. It will be much more difficult for hardline Brexiteer Tories to oppose these concessions if the PM has won a personal mandate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f5fdf4e4b05b487c0e36ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrickcollinson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-18T11:59:40.001Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A Conservative victory in the general election is almost a racing certainty, according to the bookies.</strong></p> <p>The odds on a Conservative outright majority are 1/5, said Ladbrokes, with Labour\u2019s chance of winning the most seats put at just 7/1, with even longer odds, 12/1, for obtaining a majority.</p> <p>That said, the same bookies were giving odds of 10/1 on an outright Conservative majority in the days before Cameron\u2019s surprise victory in 2015. </p> <p>Lib Dem hopes of a huge anti-Brexit surge in support are slim, judged by the odds.

We mentioned in our previous note on the French election that Francois Fillon\u2019s candidacy was worth a second look. He has a solid block of conservative voters, whose numbers may be swelled if it is a means of keeping Le Pen out of the Elysee Palace. Added to that, French voters are surprisingly immune to scandals, such as those that have plagued Fillon\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>While the latest odds still give independent Emmanuel Macron a healthy chance of winning in May, his odds have fallen as those of Fillon and Far Left candidate Melenchon have surged. If we get a Macron/ Fillon second round run-off, this is likely to be considered \u201cmarket friendly\u201d, triggering a rally in the euro, the Cac, but also in the German Dax and Eurostoxx index, which have had decent correlations with the French bond yield this year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f5cf61e4b05776df18eaf2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-18T08:45:08.194Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trader: French election could drive euro down to dollar parity</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d56f027fce1bd04a86f53723ad1027f66e4ad71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d56f027fce1bd04a86f53723ad1027f66e4ad71/1016_554_932_803/500.jpg\" alt=\"The euro symbol.\" width=\"500\" height=\"431\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Jordan Hiscott, chief Trader at ayondo markets, believes the euro would suffer sharp losses if the French election delivers a surprise result.</strong><br></p> <p>The euro is flat against the dollar this morning, at $1.065 - but it would probably tumble to parity if either Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc Melenchon defies the odds and wins the presidential race.</p> <p>Hiscott says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While at opposite ends of the spectrum politically, both are unhappy with the current terms of being in the Euro, with Le Pen after an outright referendum and Melenchon pushing for re-negotiation of the current terms, or an exit if this can\u2019t be achieved.

                "bodyText":"PS: Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s market reaction to the snap election: London traders are catching their breaths after the most volatile day for some months. So here\u2019s a closing summary. The British pound has soared to its highest levels of the year after Theresa May stunned Westminster, and the City, by calling for a general election on June 8th. Sterling has gained two cents against the US dollar, and is also up against the euro tonight. The strength of sterling helped to wipe more than \u00a345bn off the value of companies on the FTSE 100. The blue-chip index closed down 180 points, due to the strong pound hitting the value of overseas earnings, plus a fall in commodity prices. Some analysts have predicted that a large Tory win would make a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 more likely. Others have argued that it would allow May to resist pressure from hard-line eurosceptic MPs, and cut a more moderate deal with Europe. Economists also argue that the election raises the chances of a \u2018transitional deal\u2019 after 2019 (when Brexit should have happened), as the next government won\u2019t need to hold another election until 2022. City firms have been racing to revise their forecasts. Deutsche Bank was forced to rip up its bets against the pound, and promised to release new forecasts soon. There are also concerns that the election could hurt the UK economy, if it deters firms from committing to fresh investment. But in brighter news, the International Monetary Fund has revised up its forecast for UK growth this year - from 1.5% to a punchy 2%. That\u2019s all for tonight. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the latest developments this evening. GW Swiss bank UBS has just fired over a research note on the snap general election. They predict that the pound will rally against the US dollar over the next year, to around $1.36, and that shares will also rally over the next six months. Here\u2019s the key points: The election is likely to have a limited economic impact We continue to expect the pound to close some of its valuation discount to other major currencies in the months ahead Our sense is that May will use this election as an opportunity to dampen the influence of those in the Conservative party who favour the hardest form of Brexit (a World Trade Organization-type arrangement) May\u2019s presumptive plan, if it proceeds as she intended, could support the economic outlook. It is unlikely to suffice to ward off the headwinds that falling real incomes and sliding business confidence will have on growth in the short term, yet it does reinforce our view that the economy will stage a recovery in the medium term We still target GBPUSD at $1.36 in the next 12 months We see a recovery in the 10-year gilt yield to 1.50% over the next 12 months We retain our six-month FTSE 100 forecast of 7550 After a highly volatile day, the pound is sitting proudly at its highest level since last December. Sterling is currently up two cents against the US dollar at $1.276, and up one euro cent at \u20ac1.191. They\u2019re both the highest levels in four months. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the currency markets have \u201croared their approval\u201d for a snap UK election. That has a predictable impact on the FTSE 100 - which earns around 70% of its revenues from overseas, rather than in sterling. Khalaf explains: The fall in the stock market is not a negative response to the UK election per se, rather it is a knock on effect of a surging pound, combined with price falls in some key commodity markets, all of which has taken its toll on the heavyweights of the FTSE 100 index. As we\u2019ve covered earlier, many economists have predicted that the poll on June 8 will strengthen Theresa May\u2019s hand in her EU negotiations. The risk of a \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 crisis, in which MPs reject the final Brexit deal, is perceived to have fallen. Some experts are arguing that May could rein in hard-line eurosceptic MPs, if she get a robust majority. David Owen of stockbrokers Jefferies explains: With the Labour party in disarray and polling (in a poll of polls) around 15 points behind the Conservatives, and the Lib Dems still facing an uphill struggle to win a lot more seats, the 8th June will likely see Theresa May elected with a larger majority. This will not just put her in a much stronger positon when negotiating with Brussels, but also should mean that the influence of some of her own hard-Brexit backbenchers may be significantly diluted. By my reckoning, today\u2019s slump has wiped off around \u00a346bn from the combined value of the 100 companies in the FTSE 100 index. Ouch! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has suffered its biggest one-day fall since the aftermath of the EU referendum last June. The blue-chip index has ended the day down 180 points, or 2.46%, at 7147 points. That takes the FTSE 100 down to its lowest level since February 2nd, and means it\u2019s barely registered any gains in 2017. Mining companies suffered the biggest losses, with BHP Billiton, Glencore and Anglo American all down over 5%. Like other internationally-focused firms, their overseas earnings are worth less in sterling terms when the pound rallies. Miners also suffered from the fall in the price of Chinese iron ore - a potential sign of slowing demand. Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: Incredibly, on a day where the UK stocks are suffering so heavily, it is not the announcement of a general election which has caused the biggest losers, but instead the falling price of iron ore, which has dragged the likes of BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore to the bottom of the pile. Media Eghbal, Head of Countries\u2019 Analysis at Euromonitor International, is worried that the election will hurt the UK economy. She says: Weeks of campaigning leading up to the June election will add further uncertainty to an already highly ambiguous UK outlook. This will weigh on confidence and encourage investors to continue to hold off investment decisions until after the elections so it may well be now that we will start to see a slowing of economic growth. Euromonitor forecasts that UK real GDP growth will slow from Q2 2017 onwards to reach 0.8% annually by Q4 2017 compared to 2.0% a year earlier. With elections due in 2017 in Europe\u2019s three largest economies of Germany, France and now the UK (contributing 43.1% of European GDP in 2016), volatility in Europe is only set to get worse.\u201d A general election means new manifesto promises from the UK\u2019s political parties. And that could mean that existing pledges on, say, pensions and national insurance rates are ditched. Steven Cameron, Pensions Director at Aegon, says this include could the famous \u2018triple-lock\u2019 (which guarantees that pensions rise by average wages, inflation, or 2.5%, whichever is higher): He writes: \u201cWhile Brexit related matters will clearly dominate June\u2019s General Election, Political Party Manifestos could reopen other contentious issues including pensions, savings, taxation and the changing nature of employment. This could include the future of the state pension triple lock, which had looked safe until 2020, the shelved increases in self-employed National Insurance and the unfortunate \u2018will they, wont they\u2019 debate on pensions tax relief reform. Whilst revisiting these policy areas may not be a vote-winner amongst pensioners, higher rate tax payers, or the self-employed, the opportunity exists for all parties to set out their stall on these key issues, creating much needed longer term stability. Cameron predicts that rising prices could even become an election issue: \u201cWe may also see a new set of economic concerns rising in voters\u2019 minds. For example, pensioners on fixed incomes are particularly affected by the ongoing uptick in inflation we\u2019ve seen since the decision to leave the EU. Some older voters may start asking questions about each of the parties\u2019 plans to ensure it doesn\u2019t surge much beyond current levels.\u201d Financial journalist Paul Lewis also flags up the potential threat to the triple lock: With 30 minutes until the close of trading, the FTSE 100 is firmly on track for its worst day since last June. The blue-chip index is down 2.3%, or 168 points, at 7159, as the surging pound eats into the value of multinational firms in London. Sterling continues to get a boost from the general election decision - it\u2019s now up two cents at $1.276, the highest level this year. Over in parliament, chancellor Philip Hammond has hailed the surge in the pound\u2019s value today. He told MPs that the government doesn\u2019t have a view on the appropriate value of sterling -- that\u2019s a matter for the markets. But in the next breath, Hammond tells a Labour member that he\u2019s surely \u201cdelighted\u201d that the pound has risen today. He says: (The) prime minister\u2019s statement this morning has sent sterling up in the markets, demonstrating the confidence that the markets have in a future, for this country, under a Tory government with a new mandate.\u201d A glance at historic opinion polls shows why the City expects Theresa May to romp home in June.... Most City economists and investors seem convinced that Theresa May is going to win the general election by some distance (as do the bookmakers, to be fair). Here\u2019s Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explaining the market reaction: \u201cWith Brexit negotiations on the cards, the Prime Minister has sought to strengthen her hand by calling a General Election. A successful election in June would likely provide May with a larger majority, one that would ease the process of agreeing terms of negotiation in Westminster. As we have seen across the Atlantic, a divided party can cause delays in driving policy change \u2013 delays the Prime Minister simply does not have time for, so this move to consolidate her power is wise, especially as recent polls show the Conservatives leading by more than 20 points ahead of Labour. Much depends on the Conservative manifesto \u2013 but the election campaign is unlikely to upset the markets. Unless we see a political upset, a greater source of clarity and confidence will be welcomed by investors as Brexit discussions get underway in earnest.\u201d The International Monetary Fund has just got Theresa May\u2019s election campaign off to a good start, by hiking their UK growth forecasts. The IMF now expects Britain\u2019s GDP to expand by 2% this year, up from 1.5% back in January and just 1.,1% last year, outperforming almost every other advanced economy. The Fund has also raised its forecasts for global growth this year, from 3.4% to 3.5%, and attacked the protectionist policies championed by Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, says: \u201cThe global economy seems to be gaining momentum \u2013 we could be at a turning point. \u201cBut even as things look up, the post\u2013world war two system of international economic relations is under severe strain despite the aggregate benefits it has delivered \u2013 and precisely because growth and the resulting economic adjustments have too often entailed unequal rewards and costs within countries.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Share prices in London are suffering further losses. The FTSE 100 is now down 151 points, or 2%, at 7175, putting it firmly on track for its worst one-day performance since the Brexit vote. As mentioned earlier, that\u2019s mainly because the rallying pound hits the value of multinational companies listed in the City. But....the smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK focused firms, is also in the red. It\u2019s lost 227 points, or 1.1%, taking it down to 19294 points. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is in the red, with mining companies suffering the biggest losses. Deutsche Bank has declared that the general election is a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for the pound, forcing it to tear up its forecasts. Deutsche had been one of the most bearish voices in the City about sterling. Last month, it predicted that the pound would fall further as Brexit negotiations began. Not any more.... Breaking! The pound has now hit its highest level against the US dollar since last December. Sterling has extended its gains, and is now up 1.6 cents at $1.2729 - a four month high. Investors remain pretty confident that the election will deliver a decisive results, says Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cSterling has taken the news of a snap general election positively, as while it means increased political uncertainty in the near term, it probably means less uncertainty in the longer term. He\u2019s also not worried that the general election campaign will eat into the two-year window to negotiate Brexit. \u201cIf Theresa May gets a significantly increased mandate it will strengthen the UK\u2019s position in Brexit negotiations. In any case, while the UK may be distracted for the next few weeks of political uncertainty, there probably isn\u2019t much benefit in the UK engaging with French and German governments on Brexit ahead of their own elections.\u201d By calling a June election, Theresa May is effectively getting an extra two years to steer Britain through Brexit, as the next election needn\u2019t come until 2022. So argues Neil Williams, Chief Economist at Hermes Investment Management: The PM\u2019s call today to bring forward the election to 8 June looks both a way of consolidating her political position and tacit recognition that completing onerous Brexit negotiations will take longer than the two years hoped for by triggering Article 50. Holding the election this June instead of by May 2020 effectively offers her an extra two years to strike a deal before having to go to the nation again. But even this may not be long enough to address all the issues, he adds: I fear our negotiations could take many years to potentially end up back close to square one in terms of striking Mrs May\u2019s preferred \u201cbold and ambitious free trade agreement\u201d. This suggests she will negotiate to maintain access to - but no longer full membership of - a tariff-free system (akin to Canada\u2019s deal), and/or a customs union (similar to Turkey\u2019s). Even this will need time. First, the deal when struck will need Parliamentary approval, and then be subject to a \u2018phasing in\u2019 period (Mr Hammond has suggested two years) to allow firms, consumers and officials to adjust to the new arrangements. A second independence referendum in pro-EU Scotland, though not precluding Brexit, would also have provided an extra hurdle to completing it before the previous election deadline of May 2020. Second, the UK is relying on a cooperative sign-off by its 27 EU peers. The only real precedent we have is Greenland\u2019s exit in 1985. This was a \u2018soft\u2019 exit, but it took three years. We, larger and 44 years entwined in the EU, will need longer. The pound is on the brink of hitting $1.27, up over one cent today. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief strategist at City firm ActivTrades, says the market is confident that Theresa Ma will win a larger majority on 8 June. \u201cMarkets tend to like a stronger government \u2013 they are predicting one in the UK due to the apparent weaker situation Labour is in \u2013 and we have seen in Turkey what a similar situation can do for the currency. Despite today\u2019s rally, the pound is still worth 15% less against the US dollar than before the EU referendum: The poll on June 8 will be a \u201cBrexit referendum\u201d, says Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, an analyst firm. Rahman expects Theresa May will win a substantial majority, which will prevent pro-EU MPs from pushing for a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 (eg, with membership of the single market). Instead, the PM will have a mandate to get a deal, making a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 much more likely, he argues: Unity is the Tories\u2019 secret weapon. Pro-EU Tory MPs will not defy May\u2019s line during the election. They are therefore much less likely to fight for soft Brexit once she has won a mandate. The Lords, however, will still have a soft Brexit majority. Peers will still apply pressure to May but without backing in the Commons the unelected second chamber will be powerless to halt a hard Brexit. An election will therefore strengthen May\u2019s hand in the Brexit negotiations. The EU27 would arguably also have to treat her with more respect\u2014not someone who, as Nicola Sturgeon recently reminded May, had never won an election as leader. May wants an EU deal. The extra freedom that an election win would give her will also give her more room to make the concessions she has recently signalled\u2014on the divorce bill; and freedom of movement and the ECJ\u2019s remit during a transitional period. It will be much more difficult for hardline Brexiteer Tories to oppose these concessions if the PM has won a personal mandate. A Conservative victory in the general election is almost a racing certainty, according to the bookies. The odds on a Conservative outright majority are 1/5, said Ladbrokes, with Labour\u2019s chance of winning the most seats put at just 7/1, with even longer odds, 12/1, for obtaining a majority. That said, the same bookies were giving odds of 10/1 on an outright Conservative majority in the days before Cameron\u2019s surprise victory in 2015. Lib Dem hopes of a huge anti-Brexit surge in support are slim, judged by the odds. Boyle Sports reckons the party has just a 25/1 chance of winning the most seats in the House of Commons, with UKIP priced at 50/1 whilst the Green party are the 200/1 outsiders. But you can get 5/1 on their being no overall majority. It\u2019s now also a 1/5 shot Jeremy Corbyn is replaced as leader of the Labour party before the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Boyle Sports will give you 33/1 on Britain changing its mind on Brexit and rejoining the EU before the start of 2025. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u201cMay\u2019s change of heart has caught everyone by surprise, but it\u2019s looking hard to see Labour springing their own on June 8th with the Tories long odds-on for victory.\u201d The FTSE 100 is extending its losses, and now down 130 points or 1.7% at 7197. That\u2019s means we\u2019re on track for the biggest one-day selloff since the Brexit vote, as the Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham tweets: City experts are in broad agreement that Theresa May will win a larger majority on June 8th: Here\u2019s Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management: \u201cWe believe it is highly likely the Conservatives will increase their majority and firm up the future direction of government policy, particularly in regard to Brexit.\u201d Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon agrees: \u201cI guess people see that this may give Theresa May a better majority. It is a politically astute move and it should provide more stability going over the immediate aftermath of the exit from the EU.\u201d The latest odds from online betting exchange Betfair suggest they\u2019re right: UK Next General Election \u2013 Most Seats Conservative 1.11 (1/9) Labour 12 (11/1) Lib Dems 50 (49/1) UKIP 200 (199/1) Any Other 300 (299/1) Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, hopes that the general election won\u2019t JUST focus on Brexit. Politicians need to offer solutions to other problems, such as the rise of robotics and the gig economy, he says: \u201cBusinesses are having to get used to being buffeted by the changing winds of politics at the moment, and will just have to endure yet another campaign. This must be used as a chance to properly debate what leaving the EU means for the long-term future of the UK, including how we continue to bring in the skills employers need. \u201cWhile Brexit will inevitably dominate the campaign, there are also much wider questions that need to be addressed on the changing nature of business and work, automation and our ageing society. These can\u2019t be ignored in the run up to June 8, and the business voice must be heard in this crucial discussion.\u201d The pound had rallied because Theresa May is likely to win a \u201csignificant majority\u201d, says Peter Ashton, managing director of Eiger FX: \u201cThere is still huge uncertainty surrounding the implementation of Brexit but a strong majority party will help to provide a degree of stability while we negotiate the choppy waters ahead. Rob Aird, corporate partner at law firm Ashurst, says Theresa May\u2019s decision shows just how big and complex Brexit will be. He argues that the general election will have two principal effects: Optimists will say that it gives the public a chance to have their say on who should run the country during the negotiation process and how that process should be run. Cynics will argue that the Government has called this election as they sense an opportunity to increase their parliamentary majority, and extend their time in power, which will likely make agreeing and implementing Brexit (and any transitional arrangements) much easier to achieve domestically. Britain\u2019s stock market is on track for its biggest one-day fall in three months, as the surge in the pound hits shares in London. The FTSE 100, which is packed with Britain\u2019s largest companies and many multinationals, has shed 116 points to 7210. Only four of the 97 companies in the Footsie are up today. That\u2019s partly because a stronger pound will push down the value of their overseas earnings. Mining companies are leading the selloff. They were already down before May\u2019s announcement, following a sharp fall in the price of Chinese iron ore. Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, is worried that a general election could be a damaging distraction. \u201cMany business communities will understandably be concerned that attention will inevitably shift from the economy and the intricacies of leaving the EU to a potential election campaign. Firms will want to be reassured that the key challenges facing the economy will be front and centre throughout any election period.\u201d Many City experts (like many MPs!) have been caught off-guard by today\u2019s shock news. Aberdeen Asset Management Investment Manager Luke Bartholomew says it will take a while for investors to calculate what it means for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. \u201cNo one was expecting this. Not least because the Government itself ruled an election before 2020 out barely four weeks ago. But Theresa May has clearly smelt an opportunity to consolidate her mandate ahead of the Brexit negotiations. The market reaction has been muted so far. Sterling sold off initially and has now come back. But it will take investors some time to digest the effects of the election in the next few days. A big factor for them is whether the election will make a softer stance on the Brexit negotiations more likely. The election should hand Theresa May a much bigger mandate to stand up to the harder line, anti-EU backbenchers which currently hold a disproportionate sway over her party\u2019s stance on Brexit. That would be welcomed by financial markets. There\u2019s also a decent chance of some volatility now with imminent elections in both the UK and France.\u201d The pound has risen to a four-month high against a basket of international currencies. The pound has surged to its highest level since the start of February, following the dramatic news that Theresa May is calling for a general election on June 8th. Sterling has ripped higher after the prime minister declared that Britain will head to the polls in a few weeks time. With opposition parties backing the plan, the general election is nailed on. And City investors are welcoming the move -- with many predicting a large Conservative win. That has sent the pound roaring up to $1.266, its highest level in 10 weeks, after an early wobble.... Our Politics Live blog is tracking the main news; I\u2019ll pull together City reaction here.... ...starting with Shilen Shah, Bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, who says: \u201cAfter much speculation this morning, the Prime Minister has confirmed that she is calling an early general election to fully implement the Brexit process. \u201cFollowing some initial weakness ahead of the statement, Sterling has stabilised and is slightly up on the day. Gilts yields have also been stable, with the 10-year yield hitting a session low of 1.01%.Overall, today\u2019s announcement suggests that PM wants full control of the Brexit process without any interference from the opposition.\u201d It\u2019s official! Theresa May has called for a general election, on 8 June. Sterling has actually recovered its early losses, and is back to $1.257 against the US dollar. Full coverage here: FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, sums up the mood in the City right now: There has been some sudden selling in the British Pound over the past few minutes following the news that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will be making a statement within the next hour. There are unconfirmed rumors at this stage circulating that Theresa May might be stepping down, while there are other reports going around that this could be linked to the announcement of a UK general election. Truth be told, nobody is really that aware of what is going on but this uncertainty has caused a reaction in the Sterling. Money is also pouring into UK government bonds, as nervous investors prepare to hear Theresa May\u2019s statement. That has driven the price of UK debt up, sending the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year bonds down to a six-month low. Back in the City, the pound has fallen sharply following the news that prime minister Theresa May will deliver an unexpected statement at 11.15am. The Westminster rumour mill is in overdrive, with speculation of an early general election. And that\u2019s pulled sterling back towards $1.25, having hit a three week high this morning. No-one really knows what\u2019s going on, which is another reason to sell the pound.... Our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow is on the case: On the other hand, the euro could rally if French voters plump for a more mainstream candidate. Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts a \u2018relief rally\u2019 if Marine Le Pen is eliminated in the first round of voting, on Sunday. She writes: Since Marine Le Pen is the most euro-toxic of all of the candidates, one can assume that a first round eradication for her Front National Party could trigger a relief rally in the euro in a week from now. We mentioned in our previous note on the French election that Francois Fillon\u2019s candidacy was worth a second look. He has a solid block of conservative voters, whose numbers may be swelled if it is a means of keeping Le Pen out of the Elysee Palace. Added to that, French voters are surprisingly immune to scandals, such as those that have plagued Fillon\u2019s candidacy. While the latest odds still give independent Emmanuel Macron a healthy chance of winning in May, his odds have fallen as those of Fillon and Far Left candidate Melenchon have surged. If we get a Macron/ Fillon second round run-off, this is likely to be considered \u201cmarket friendly\u201d, triggering a rally in the euro, the Cac, but also in the German Dax and Eurostoxx index, which have had decent correlations with the French bond yield this year. Jordan Hiscott, chief Trader at ayondo markets, believes the euro would suffer sharp losses if the French election delivers a surprise result. The euro is flat against the dollar this morning, at $1.065 - but it would probably tumble to parity if either Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc Melenchon defies the odds and wins the presidential race. Hiscott says: While at opposite ends of the spectrum politically, both are unhappy with the current terms of being in the Euro, with Le Pen after an outright referendum and Melenchon pushing for re-negotiation of the current terms, or an exit if this can\u2019t be achieved. What can we determine from this? Two French politicians at opposite ends of the political spectrum, almost united in their mutual dislike, in its current form, of an institution they were the key founders of and have been the biggest supporters of for the past 30 years. \u201cIf we extrapolate this to Europe\u2019s financial assets, looking at EUR-USD in particular, the prognosis is not good. The dual effect of two anti-EU politicians could weigh heavily and while currently trading around 1.0625, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see parity with the US dollar following a Le Pen or Melenchon victory. Amazingly enough, this wouldn\u2019t be a level seen since the October 31 2002, and a lifetime away from the all-time high of 1.60 in 2008. Whatever the result from the French elections, its arguable, the fragmentation of Europe is in swing.\u201d France\u2019s borrowing costs have inched up this morning, widening the gap with safe-haven German debt. That\u2019s a signal that investors are getting more worried about Sunday\u2019s election. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s 10-year bond yield rose 2.5 basis points in early Tuesday trade to 0.93 percent, while German Bund yields were marginally lower at 0.18 percent and within sight of Friday\u2019s more than three-month low of 0.16 percent. That left the gap between the two at 75 basis points and not far from six-week highs hit last week around 78 bps. The spread between short-dated French and German bond yields was at 44 bps - also within sight of six-week highs. Christine Lagarde has also claimed that Britain\u2019s economy is starting to suffer from last year\u2019s Brexit vote -- even though growth has been rather stronger than the IMF predicted. QUESTION - You say the UK is still having growth, being still in the EU. Do you think that Brexit can be a bad trip for the UK? MS. LAGARDE - As you know, we had anticipated a much lower growth than the UK has demonstrated during the last quarters. But we are beginning to see \u2013 in terms of disposable incomes, of depreciation of the currency, etc. \u2013 the beginning of the impact of Brexit. And the more discussion there is of companies or financial institutions relocating to Frankfurt, Dublin or Paris, the more uncertainty there will be in a country where the capital city plays such a role as a financial center. The IMF will release its latest forecasts for the UK in under five hours time, as part of the World Economic Outlook. It has already revised up its 2017 growth forecast once this year, in January - from 1.1% to 1.5%...... On America, Lagarde seems to acknowledge that criticism of Germany\u2019s trade surplus are valid --- although she doesn\u2019t approve of Donald Trump\u2019s approach: QUESTION - Is Trump right to criticize the German trade surplus? Are the bad guys saying the right things? MS. LAGARDE - I would stay away of the \u201cbad guy\u201d language--that is a moral judgement that does not have a place in the kind of work we do. When there are excessive imbalances, when there is excessive inequality, or instability in the financial system, all those three are bad for stability, for the sustainability of growth. We do not shy away from saying that. During her interview with European reporters, Christine Lagarde also warned that the IMF is adamant that Greece needs debt relief - and it won\u2019t join its bailout programme until this is tackled. QUESTION - Without a debt restructure upfront, the IMF will not participate? MS. LAGARDE - If the Greek debt is not sustainable in accordance with the IMF\u2019s rules and on the basis of reasonable parameters, we will not participate in the program. QUESTION - Is the staff of the IMF now convinced that the debt is not sustainable as it is? MS. LAGARDE - Based on the debt sustainability analysis, we will determine how much debt needs to be restructured. But there is no question in our mind that a degree of debt restructuring is needed. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest French polling data: Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the French presidential election is casting a \u201chuge question mark\u201d over the eurozone. In an interview with several European journalists, just published, Lagarde says that France\u2019s election race is causing rising uncertainty worldwide, and creating fresh uncertainty over the future of the currency bloc. Here\u2019s the key section: Q: Is the fate of the euro also at stake in the French presidential elections? MS. LAGARDE - It is clearly one of the debates. And one that actually weighs on the confidence and the stability of the euro area--because if one of the largest partners is wondering if its destiny and fate is in or out of the group, it is a huge question mark for the others. Two of the candidates in this spring\u2019s election have made no secret of their opposition to European institutions. Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front, has repeatedly blamed the single currency for hurting France\u2019s economy - arguing that the country would prosper if it returned to the franc. Poll suggest that she could win the first round of voting, this Sunday. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the far-left candidate who is making a late surge in the polls, is also a critic of the European Union. He has vowed to renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with the EU - and hold a referendum on exiting the Union if he fails. Many political analysts argue that Le Pen would lose the second-round run-off to either Emmanuel Macron or Francois Fillon -- both of whom are less critical of the euro. But, as Christine Lagarde puts it, there is clearly \u201crising concern\u201d about the uncertain outcome of the elections. She says: There is no single country that I have visited in the last couple of months where I have not been asked with anxiety what the outcome might be. It matters because of the role played by France, the size of the French economy relative to other euro area partners, and because some of the ideas being discussed seem aimed at disrupting the current architecture of the European Union as far as France is concerned. The sooner that uncertainty is removed, and I guess it will have to wait until May 7th, the better it will be for the global economy, and of course, for the euro area economy. I\u2019ll truffle through the interviews for more significant points now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have lots to ponder as they return to their desks following the Easter holidays break, with plenty of geopolitical risks swirling. The French presidential election, last weekend\u2019s controversial Turkish referendum, and rising tensions between America and North Korea could all move the markets this week. With less than a week to go until the first round of voting, France\u2019s election looks pretty tight. Far-left politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon is making a late charge, gaining ground on centrist Emmanuel Macron, right-winger Francois Fillon and National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Interestingly, Fillon appears to be shaking off the allegations of wrongful payments to family members that rattled his campaign. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: The latest poll (from Opinionway) puts macron and Le pen at 22%, Fillon at 21% and Melenchon at 18%. So where last week it was Melenchon who was surging, now M Fillon is closing in. Uncertainty reigns supreme and relative rates are going to struggle to drive the Euro higher against that backdrop. All the main candidates are making a late push before Sunday\u2019s polls; the top two will enter the crucial second-round runoff in early May. Further afield, Pyongyang\u2019s latest (failed) missile test is a particular concern to investors - especially as a senior North Korean official has warned that \u201cthermonuclear war may break out at any moment\u201d. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons investors are looking for Washington\u2019s reaction (vice-president Mike Pence is in South Korea today). North Korea faced another failure in its nuclear test and investors are wondering what will be the reaction from the US and its allies. The demand for other safe haven assets also picked up in the light of this, spot gold is moving further closer to our target of $1300. We are sitting near a five month high. When it comes to the gold price, we do think that the momentum could easily continue and bias remain skewed for more upside move. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, says: \u201cIt seems the focus is now firmly on future missile tests from North Korea and whether any future tests will actually be successful. One suspects the concerns in North Korea have further to play out.\u201d The Turkish lira, meanwhile, has rallied after Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan claimed a narrow, and contested, victory in a referendum to reshape Turkey\u2019s constitution as a presidential republic. The lira gained 2% against the US dollar yesterday as investors calculate that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s win means less political instability. It will certainly give him sweeping new powers; critics fear more authoritarianism and further crackdowns against the president\u2019s opponents. The legitimacy of the result is being questioned \u2013 as more than 1 million votes without official stamps were included.

                "bodyText":"British businesses have lived through some turbulent times recently (like the rest of us....). So a snap election probably won\u2019t cause as much disruption as the shock EU referendum vote. So argues Edmund Parker, partner at legal firm Mayer Brown: \u201cBrexit brought about a significant pause in deal making. However, yesterday\u2019s announcement of a snap election seems less likely to have the same impact on deals and financial activity, as many of the polls believe May will boost her majority, and this will give her a stronger hand in Brexit negotiations, with fewer factions to please.\u201d \u201cHowever, we\u2019re living in uncertain times and if anything changes between now and the 8 June, we still may see a slowdown in activity. The starting gun has only just been fired. Ultimately, uncertainty is becoming the new normal and the markets are just getting on with it. To a large degree, this latest round of \u2018uncertainty\u2019 is just a different shade of the same.\u201d The pound is coming under some late pressure tonight. After a steady day, sterling is now down almost half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2795, having hit a six-month high last night. After initially hailing Theresa May\u2019s push for a snap election, some in the City are now pondering exactly how the campaign will play out. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says many traders are still cautious about the pound\u2019s prospects. The market still remains in a negative mindset for sterling with short positions still elevated. Some investors may also be wondering whether the Conservatives are really nailed on for a landslide, as opinion polls suggest. Richard Benson of currency fund Millennium Global explains (via Reuters):. \u201cIt isn\u2019t quite the one-way street that a lot of people have painted over the last 20 hours. With a 20-point lead off the starting blocs, I would have thought the risk is more that it will narrow than grow. A positive surprise from the French election would also presumably see a squeeze higher in the euro after the weekend.\u201d BREAKING! Edginess over the UK snap general election has sent the FTSE 100 index deeper into the red, wiping out all its gains so far this year. The blue-chip index has just closed for the night, down 33 points at 7114 points. That adds to the 180 points lost yesterday, which wiped \u00a346bn off the index (we\u2019ve lost another \u00a38bn today). This takes the FTSE 100 down to an 11-week low, and means the index is now lower than on 1st January 2017. Fashion firm Burberry was the big faller, down almost 8%, after it warned of uncertain trading conditions and falling sales in the US this morning. Energy companies also lost ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, blames \u201congoing political uncertainty\u201d for spurring investors to sell shares. The FTSE has suffered a somewhat disappointing end to Wednesday\u2019s trade, as early gains were eroded in the wake of the vote to dissolve parliament ahead of a snap General Election in seven weeks\u2019 time. After yesterday\u2019s dramatic crash for the FTSE, today has been more about stability as traders seek to ascertain whether such a dramatic selloff is really justified ahead of what looks likely to be a landslide for the Conservatives. However, the FTSE 250 index (which is arguably a better measure of the UK economy) has closed higher. It gained 119 points to 19,417, up 0.6%, taking it closer to the record high hit last Thursday. Here\u2019s another chart showing how the FTSE 250 has caught up with the FTSE 100, after suffering much heavier losses immediately after the EU referendum: Back in parliament Sajid Javid, the secretary of state for Communities and Local Government, has been answering questions about Britain\u2019s housing problem. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the key points: Sophie Barnes of Inside Housing also tweeted from the session: Bloomberg has spotted that the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has been outperforming the larger FTSE 100 for several weeks, and by more than ever before. The white line on this chart shows how the gap between the two indices has risen (a higher number means the 250 has extended its lead). That\u2019s partly because the massive companies on the FTSE 100 are vulnerable to sterling (as they earn money overseas). Mining companies have also been hurt by volatile commodity prices. There\u2019s a general feeling in the City that Theresa May will get a larger majority on June 8, and this will strengthen her hand in the battles ahead with Brussels. That\u2019s why the pound jumped so high yesterday, and had held those gains today. But.... just packing the House of Commons with more Tory MPs won\u2019t make the Brexit talks a breeze, when it comes down to the cost of leaving the EU, and the details of a trade deal. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga suspects that the pound could have rebounded too far, given the uncertainty. He says: Questions should be raised over the sustainability of the current Sterling rally, especially when considering how political uncertainties and Brexit woes remain current. Investors are still pondering over the economic future of the United Kingdom after Brexit, with questions still being raised about whether the two-year timeframe will be enough to secure a deal. Although the European Union has stated that they will not punish Britain during negotiations, the thought of the EU making an example out of Britain to prevent others from leaving the bloc does linger in the background. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, also spies problems ahead: Evidently, investors are hopeful that the UK Prime Minister will have a stronger mandate to secure the UK\u2019s EU exit from the EU as she will be able to push back hard deadlines for a trade deal until the next election in 2022, assuming she wins this one. But that is the hope, in reality things might turn out differently, as US investors are starting to find out with regards to Donald Trump. Clearly, Brexit-related uncertainty will remain in place for a while yet. It\u2019s official! Britain is heading back to the ballot box in June. 522 MPs have voted in favour of a snap general election, comfortably more than was needed. But 13 MPs voted against, which means there were around 100 abstentions. Our Politics Live blog has full details: There\u2019s not immediate market reaction -- obviously it would have been a shock if MPs had voted the other way. Over in parliament, MPs are now voting on whether to hold a general election on June 8th. Theresa May needs a two-thirds majority, under the Fixed Term Parliament Act - which should be a breeze as most opposition MPs have said they\u2019ll support the PM\u2019s plan. Just in: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy could be threatened by Brexit uncertainty. In its new Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF flags up that the financial system could be weakened if banks are forced to leave the City, to maintain full access to the EU. The fund says: \u201cUncertainty about the negotiation outcome is pushing banks to anticipate Brexit-related costs. Banks have started preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which no agreement is reached, to avoid any possible disruption to their services. Duplication of some activities and business structures in different locations seems inevitable and represents an extra cost. Operating in different regulatory regimes will also increase the burden on banks. The Report also flags up China\u2019s economy, Europe\u2019s weak banks, and Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies as potential causes of financial instability. Here\u2019s our full story from Washington: Despite this week\u2019s losses, the FTSE 100 is still up over 12% since last June\u2019s referendum. However, it\u2019s NOT as simple as that, because the index is priced in sterling (so a weaker pound pushed up share prices). In dollar terms, the Footsie is down around 1% since the Brexit vote: The FTSE 100 is continuing to slide, adding to yesterday\u2019s 2.5% tumble. The blue-chip index is now down 25 points at 7122, its lowest point since 2nd February, and putting it deeper into the red for 2017. Burberry are still the biggest faller, down almost 6%, after reporting slowing sales growth this morning. Silver miner Fresnillo are close behind, down 3%, followed by gold producer Randgold (-2.4%) , Rolls-Royce (-2.3%) and Royal Dutch Shell (-2%). Analysts at RBC Capital Markets are predicting that the Liberal Democratic party will gain seats on June 8th. The Lib Dems currently have just nine seats, having suffered a near-wipeout in the 2015 election. But their vocal opposition to Brexit is likely to win support from the 48% of voters wanted to Remain in the EU last year. RBC say: The recent opinion polls suggest a strong lead of the Conservative party over the biggest opposition party, Labour. The latest set of polls indicates that there will be a 19% lead in the popular vote. This would almost certainly increase the number of seats in the House of Commons from the current 17 to a much more sizeable majority. Nonetheless, a lot can change between now and June 8 and it seems likely that the Liberal Democrats will be able to increase their number of MPs from the current setting as they are the only party openly campaigning on a pro-European tickets. In this respect heightened volatility in UK assets as we approach the election. After a calm morning, the pound has held onto Tuesday\u2019s strong gains. Sterling is broadly unchanged against the US dollar right now, at $1.285, and against the euro at \u20ac1.197. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says currency traders are hoping that Britain can avoid a particularly hard Brexit: Through May\u2019s snap election, she at last has the opportunity to take full control of the Brexit process and minimise the political uncertainty which has beset her tenure that had several implications for the currency. Once again, the narrative of sterling has changed from one of uncertainty and volatility in the days following the referendum, to the relative stability of a defined negotiation period following the triggering of Article 50, and now to the possibility of renewed strength as the prospect of \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit and a more coherent negotiating position from the UK\u2019s government becomes a possibility. Morgan Stanley has predicted that the snap general election means Britain is almost certain to leave the single market. But it also reduces the risk of a disorderly Brexit (assuming the polls are right, and the Conservatives win a larger majority). That\u2019s according to a new research note from MS on the general election. Here\u2019s the highlights: Why it virtually rules out staying in the single market: On Brexit, we expect the \u201csovereignty\u201d red lines on UK control over borders, courts and laws, which were set out in the Lancaster House speech, to be put into the Conservative manifesto, effectively ruling out a Remain or EEA outcome. A Conservative government would then imply leaving the single market: either a WTO-like outcome where the UK re-establishes national control but at the cost of economic barriers with the EU, or a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d FTA outcome where the UK re-establishes national control while avoiding major barriers to business with the EU. Why it reduces the risk of a disorderly Brexit: In the base case the UK government would have the Parliamentary majority to push through difficult decisions to seal a deal. In addition, the next Parliament should have time to complete Brexit negotiations before the next scheduled UK election in June 2022. Back in the markets, Britain\u2019s medium-sized companies, are bouncing back from yesterday\u2019s selloff. The FTSE 250 index, which is packed with UK mid-cap firms, has now jumped by 1% today to 19,491 points. Familiar firms such as high street chain Dixons Carphone (+3.7%), holiday firm Thomas Cook (+3.3%) and builders merchants Travis Perkins (+3.5) are among the top risers. Chris Beauchamp of City spread betting firm IG says the FTSE 250 has \u201cleapt out of bed\u201d as investors look to buy up UK-focused assets. As the shock fades from the election announcement, there is a real possibility of a rebound in UK stocks, since yesterday\u2019s fall provided the kind of dip that bargain hunters have been praying for over the past few weeks..... Signs of weakness in the US market will give cause for concern, but overall it still looks like a strong update that points to more growth further down the line. This takes the FTSE 250 back towards last week\u2019s record high (19,525 points), and claws back most of Tuesday\u2019s losses. But its big brother, the FTSE 100, is lagging behind - having shed all its gains for 2017 this morning following yesterday\u2019s 2.5% tumble. Many British firms will welcome the June election, as it should provide a little more certainty about the future. So argues Karen Briggs, Head of Brexit (great job title!) at KPMG, who says: \u201cUK PLC understands the Brexit journey will be a bumpy one. We are getting used to a new normal where political shocks are commonplace, foreign exchange shifts dramatic and the UK\u2019s labour supply in transition. \u201cBusinesses desperately want to make a success of Brexit but their fear has long been that the sheer scale of the negotiations mean they cannot be completed in two years. This might mean vital details in everything from finance, to life sciences and aviation being missed or delayed - upending business models and affecting jobs. \u201cThe prospect of a government now serving until 2022 creates a window for even clearer negotiating objectives and a less frenzied implementation period. Business will hope this makes for a smoother Brexit with more time to fix the intricate detail of a good deal and adequate time to prepare for necessary change.\u201d City traders have another market to watch....and this one shows Theresa May winning a majority of around 100 seats on June 8th , up from just 17 today. Newsflash from Brussels: Eurozone inflation fell to 1.5% in March, down from 2% in February. That\u2019s mainly due to Easter falling in April, and matches the earlier \u2018flash\u2019 reading. It\u2019s rather lower than in the UK, where price are now rising by 2.3% year-on-year, as this chart hows.... Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes the UK pound will keep rallying against the US dollar as the British election campaign picks up. The pound might even hit $1.35 (from $1.28 today), she argues, if the Conservatives look likely to win a large majority. In and of itself the UK election shouldn\u2019t be a key driver of UK asset prices, particularly if Theresa May wins a landslide, as she is expected to do. This election shouldn\u2019t change domestic policy too much, and Brexit was going to happen with or without the vote on June 8th. However, if the polls are to be believed about the Tory lead over Labour then this election could add certainty to the UK\u2019s Brexit positioning stance and to domestic policy for the next 5 years, and that is good for markets. For GBP/USD 1.30 is now in view, and as we lead up to the election then we could see more unwinding of the GBP/USD short positions which could take us to 1.35 around the time of the election result. Viktor Nossek, director of research at ETF provider WisdomTree in Europe, says investors expect Theresa May to do well on June 8th. He says: The sharp jump in the pound yesterday against a number of currencies, including the US dollar, was an acknowledgment that the snap election is likely to lead to more political certainty, given the Conservative Party\u2019s lead in the polls. There would be far more downside risk for the Prime Minister if she had waited another 12 months before acting, but by deciding to hold an election on June 8th - with the sentiment in the UK still in favour of Brexit - it means the Tories will be able to cement their position and allow the PM to get the political support needed to follow her agenda. The move has also given the opposition little room to prepare, and call for, an alternative to Brexit, or a watered-down version of it. Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities, told Bloomberg News that the snap UK election has unnerved some investors. The market dislikes uncertainty. Investors had already been a little on edge over the French presidential election, and now the UK general election is creating further uncertainty in Europe. Here\u2019s a list of the leading risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. One of the MPs who did the most to hold Britain\u2019s business leaders to account is stepping down. Iain Wright, the Hartlepool MP who chaired the Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy Committee, has announced on Twitter he won\u2019t run in the June 8 election. Wright\u2019s committee held some important inquiries this parliament, probing the scandal of the collapse of BHS and the unacceptable working practices at Sports Direct. Britain\u2019s retailers should be celebrating yesterday\u2019s surge in the pound, as it will make it cheaper to import goods from abroad. Analyst Nick Bubb comments: Well, the Fixed Term Parliament Act was meant to bring us \u201cstability\u201d and \u201ccertainty\u201d, but we are now told we need a General Election on June 8th for that\u2026Time will tell whether an increased Tory majority will deliver the \u201csofter\u201d Brexit the City hopes for, but retailers will be pleased if sterling has now bottomed out\u2026 Fashion group Burberry is helping to pull the FTSE 100 into the red today, after reporting underwhelming results. Burberry\u2019s shares have shed 6.7%, their worst fall since October, after reporting a sales slowdown, due to tougher conditions in the US. CEO Christopher Bailey said the market was \u2018uncertain\u2019, despite strong sales in the UK as the weak pound encouraged tourists to buy Burberry items here. The company\u2019s finance officer has told reporters that Burberry remains committed to UK manufacturing, despite the Brexit uncertainty, and hopes that the UK will secure a trade deal with Europe that avoids returning to World Trade Organisation rules. Our Politics Live blog is up and running, and tracking all the election action. Theresa May has already been interviewed on the Today Programme, where she\u2019s ruled out a second EU referendum, and defended her decision to call a general election: The FTSE 250 index, which is a better gauge of the UK economy than the FTSE 100, is having a slightly better morning. It\u2019s clawed back 43 points, or 0.23%, having lost over 220 points yesterday. The pound is holding steady this morning - which is another way of saying that it\u2019s not done much yet. Sterling is trading at $1.284 against the US dollar, having surged to a six-month high of $1.29 late last night. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says the currency markets are closely focused on the pound. Yesterday\u2019s surprise move by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May calling a snap election sent the British pound to its highest levels against the US dollar since October. The 400-pip move [from $1.25 to $1.29] from low to high is not a reflection of the short-term fundamental outlook for the U.K.\u2019s economy. But traders expect the snap election to lead to stronger negotiation powers with the EU on Brexit terms, thus a softer exit. Today we expect May to win parliamentary support for the snap election, but the reaction on the Pound to be mild, given it\u2019s already priced in. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons that low turnout might scupper Theresa May\u2019s hopes for a whopping majority: While advertising magnate Sir Martin Sorrell fears the election might have a dampening effect on the economy: Britain\u2019s leading stock index has shed all its gains for 2017, as Theresa May\u2019s election call continues to grip the City. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 17 points at the start of trading, adding to the 180 points it lost yesterday. That takes the blue-chip index down to 7130 points, below the closing price of 7142 on 30 December 2016. That\u2019s also the lowest level since late January. Yesterday\u2019s selloff was mainly due to a surge in the pound, as traders welcomed the snap election. A stronger pound erodes the value of overseas earnings, hitting the value of multinationals. Tony Cross of TopTradr predicts that political uncertainty will weigh on the markets until the UK election is out of the way. The market\u2019s clear belief is that the incumbent party will win again, and with a bigger majority. This in turn will make for a cleaner break when the Brexit negotiations conclude \u2013 something that has driven the pound crosses out to six month highs. Success in today\u2019s vote in Parliament - which is required to approve the early election - is a foregone conclusion, but the risk is that the vote in early June doesn\u2019t return the result that\u2019s expected. Early polling suggests it will, but with the centrist Liberal Democrat party likely to make sweeping gains from their diminished current position, they could be the deal-makers again as they were in 2010. Given they are expected to be running on a ticket that promotes retaining single market access, we should be bracing for further volatility as this campaign unfolds over the next seven weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have come down with a double-dose of election fever. The symptoms? Worrying about whether Marine Le Pen could sweep into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, while also pondering how Theresa May\u2019s snap general election call will effect the Brexit negotiations. The French presidential election is looking increasingly right, with just four days until the first round of voting. The consensus view, that centrist Emmanuel Macron would beat Le Pen in the second round in early May, is looking shaky. With right-winger Francois Fillon and Communist-backed Jean-Luc Melenchon both gaining ground, it\u2019s hard to say exactly who\u2019ll claim the prized top two places on Sunday. The prospect of Le Pen and Melenchon contesting the run-off is causing some jitters in the City. As correspondent Angelique Chrisafis reports from Paris, tension is mounting among Macron\u2019s team too: The independent centrist, who is running in his first election, had been seen as a frontrunner but faces a gruelling final few days before the first-round presidential vote this Sunday. Styling himself as a pro-Europe progressive, he went from dark-horse outsider to favourite three months ago. But as polls narrow and a third of the electorate remains undecided, the race has become increasingly uncertain. Macron\u2019s supporters concede that the last few days of campaigning will be tough and unpredictable. Although polls have shown he could win a second round runoff on 7 May, Macron first has to make it to the final round \u2013 and that is not by any means guaranteed. \u201cThe new president,\u201d said one butcher as he posed for a selfie with Macron at the market. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t won yet!\u201d came the cry from the scrum of media recording the moment. \u201cYou have to vote first,\u201d Macron reminded him gently. Meanwhile in London, MPs are expected to approve Theresa May\u2019s plan for a general election on 8 June. That shock decision sent the pound to a six month high last night, but also wiped \u00a346bn off the FTSE 100. The City\u2019s snap reaction is that Theresa May will claim a large majority, strengthening her hand in the Brexit talks, and removing the chance of being derailed by either pro-Remain MPs or hard-line eurosceptics. That could cut the chances of her final deal being rejected by parliament. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Britain gets a better deal. As our financial editor Nils Pratley says, the Brexit talks will still be tough: If delivering a \u201csuccessful\u201d Brexit involves making a few pragmatic compromises \u2013 which is surely the lesson from the initial skirmishes with the EU negotiators \u2013 you can\u2019t blame May for seeking cover from the hard-liners in her own party. And kicking out the next election until 2022 seems a smart political move: it would allow time for a three-year transitional phase before UK voters go back to the polls, which could take the edge off any economic shock at the moment of Brexit in 2019. So, yes, it was fair for investors to take some comfort in the idea that a market-friendly \u201csoft\u201d Brexit is now easier to imagine. Just don\u2019t get too carried away with the idea. Investment uncertainties rarely evaporate so easily. If the election delivers a messy result \u2013 even a barely improved Tory majority \u2013 what would really have changed? Coming up today... The International Monetary Fund is releasing its Global Financial Stability Report at 1.30pm GMT. That will identify the biggest threats to the world economy. We get a final estimate of eurozone inflation for March, at 10am BST (corrected). New European car sales figures are out this morning (more on that shortly). Fashion chain Burberry, food and closing group Associated British Foods and packaging group Bunzl are reporting results.",

But here\u2019s a flavour of the Economist\u2019s argument:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Macron is untainted, if only because he is a political outsider. He has never held elected office, though he was the appointed economy minister in the present government. His plans are less bold than Mr Fillon\u2019s, cutting only 120,000 public jobs and \u20ac60bn in spending, but an independent study rates them as equally free-market. Mr Macron is pro-business, but more subtle about it. Instead of abolishing the 35-hour week, he would help companies work around it. Rather than raise the retirement age, he would unify the country\u2019s 35 pension schemes, eventually doing more to enhance labour mobility.</p> <p>Mr Macron is more outward-looking, too. He backs recent EU free-trade deals that Mr Fillon rejects. He is more likely to be able to work with Germany to strengthen the governance of the euro. He is socially liberal, whereas his opponent, close to Roman Catholic traditionalists, opposed gay marriage and wants to limit gay adoption. Mr Fillon would impose immigration quotas and end sanctions against Russia; Mr Macron exhorts the French to live up to their values.</p> <p>The worry is that Mr Macron will not get his reforms through the legislature. Though En Marche!, the party he founded, will run in every constituency in elections to the National Assembly in June, it will struggle to win a majority, unlike Mr Fillon\u2019s Republicans. But do not write off his political skills. In rallies and on TV he has more than held his own. En Marche! is barely a year old, but it has 250,000 members\u2014more than twice as many as the Socialists.</p> <p>His critics say Mr Macron is wishy-washy. But he is the only candidate who has made a full-blooded case for the open society and economy this newspaper believes in. That takes courage\u2014the courage to step outside France\u2019s party system, to defend complex arguments against polarising sound bites and to stand for optimism in an age of identity politics. That is a message all democracies need to hear.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721143-french-go-polls-they-are-angry-and-divided-consequential-choice-franceand\">A consequential choice for France\u2014and an uncertain one</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f8cc3fe4b05b487c0e4261\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T15:03:43.478Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall tweets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tom_nuttall/status/855070584056799232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our cover this week. <a href=\"https://t.co/GynxZc4Ve6\">pic.twitter.com/GynxZc4Ve6</a></p>&mdash; Tom Nuttall (@tom_nuttall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_nuttall/status/855070584056799232\">April 20, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58f8cc90e4b0e0ec04f02c0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-20T14:58:53.344Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Encouraging news.

The IMF, which only this week said it could not participate in the latest bailout programme unless Greece\u2019s debt burden became manageable, projected the country\u2019s primary surplus would be just 2% in 2018, well short of its target of 3.5%.

                "bodyText":"France\u2019s stock market has surged today as excitement mounts ahead of Sunday\u2019s presidential vote. The CAC 40 outperformed other European indices to end the day 1.7% higher. Almost every share gained ground in a broad-based rally, led by financial companies and industrial firms. Shares were boosted by forecasts that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron would win the race to succeed Francois Hollande -- even though opinion polls should be treated with plenty of caution these days..... The euro has also held onto this morning\u2019s gains, and is trading at a three-week high of $1.076 tonight. Joshua Mahony of IG says traders are pretty confident that Macron will win in the second round of voting, on May 8th. The stability we have seen in the markets today is a clear nod to the blas\u00e9 outlook that the trading community is holding with regards to this weekend\u2019s French election. The first round is widely expected to result in a toss-up between Le Pen and Macron, but most expect voters to team up against Le Pen in the second round. The threat of an upset seems likely to be negated by the structure of the French democratic system. But could Francois Fillon spring a surprise? Marchel Alexandrovich of stockbroking firm Jefferies argues that Fillon\u2019s popularity with older voters could be decisive: For example, one of the latest French polls with a demographic breakdown shows two things: the older voters are more likely to vote, and they still overwhelmingly support Fillon. In fact no candidate carries as much support with any demographic group as Fillon does with the over 65s. And what if Marine Le Pen, or the far-left\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, defied the experts? Daniel Christen of Capital Economics explains how a shock result would reignite the eurozone crisis: If either Le Pen or M\u00e9lenchon were to become the next president, there could be a big reaction in the markets. France\u2019s sovereign credit spread would probably surge as fears over her creditworthiness rose. And in our view, it is likely that the euro would fall. Unlike a potential \u201cGrexit\u201d, a \u201cFrexit\u201d would pose an existential threat to the common currency. Even if investors thought that a \u201cFrexit\u201d wouldn\u2019t occur any time soon, the two candidates\u2019 views on monetary policy might be enough to make investors shy away from holding euros. And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A reminder, from Sky News, of how close the French election looks: The Economist has just backed Emmanuel Macron for the French presidency. It argues that the centrist candidate can break the mould of French politics and push through reforms to improve the French economy. It\u2019s not really a surprise. But here\u2019s a flavour of the Economist\u2019s argument: Mr Macron is untainted, if only because he is a political outsider. He has never held elected office, though he was the appointed economy minister in the present government. His plans are less bold than Mr Fillon\u2019s, cutting only 120,000 public jobs and \u20ac60bn in spending, but an independent study rates them as equally free-market. Mr Macron is pro-business, but more subtle about it. Instead of abolishing the 35-hour week, he would help companies work around it. Rather than raise the retirement age, he would unify the country\u2019s 35 pension schemes, eventually doing more to enhance labour mobility. Mr Macron is more outward-looking, too. He backs recent EU free-trade deals that Mr Fillon rejects. He is more likely to be able to work with Germany to strengthen the governance of the euro. He is socially liberal, whereas his opponent, close to Roman Catholic traditionalists, opposed gay marriage and wants to limit gay adoption. Mr Fillon would impose immigration quotas and end sanctions against Russia; Mr Macron exhorts the French to live up to their values. The worry is that Mr Macron will not get his reforms through the legislature. Though En Marche!, the party he founded, will run in every constituency in elections to the National Assembly in June, it will struggle to win a majority, unlike Mr Fillon\u2019s Republicans. But do not write off his political skills. In rallies and on TV he has more than held his own. En Marche! is barely a year old, but it has 250,000 members\u2014more than twice as many as the Socialists. His critics say Mr Macron is wishy-washy. But he is the only candidate who has made a full-blooded case for the open society and economy this newspaper believes in. That takes courage\u2014the courage to step outside France\u2019s party system, to defend complex arguments against polarising sound bites and to stand for optimism in an age of identity politics. That is a message all democracies need to hear. More here. A consequential choice for France\u2014and an uncertain one The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall tweets: Encouraging news. Consumer confidence in the eurozone has risen to a 25-month high. It\u2019s another sign that the European economy is strengthening. Back in Washington, Christine Lagarde has also taken a swing at Germany\u2019s trade surplus, saying the country\u2019s external imbalances should be addressed. Germany posted a current account surplus of \u20ac253bn, or over 8% of GDP; critics want it to spend, borrow and import more to bring this surplus down. The latest unemployment figures from America show that the US labo(u)r market remains pretty strong. The number of new applications for jobless benefit rose by 10,000 last week, to 244,000 - well below the 300,000 threshold that shows a healthy jobs market. But the continuing claims figure, a wider measure of unemployment, is at its lowest level since 2000. An upbeat-sounding Christine Lagarde has launched this week\u2019s Spring Meeting by calling for a new push for innovation, closer trade ties and a clampdown on tax evasion. The Greek government is hoping to make progress in its negotiations with creditors at the IMF Spring meeting this week. The country\u2019s finance minister, national economy minister and deputy finance minister are all flying to Washington today for crucial debt talks, including with Fund chief Christine Lagarde. Helena Smith reports from Athens Greek officials say the all-important issue of debt \u2013 and ways to reduce it \u2013 will be at the core of talks the finance and national economy ministers, Euclid Tskalotos and Dimitris Papadimitriou, will have in Washington. Tsakalotos, whose first meeting will be with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde on Friday, is hoping that the framework of a debt relief deal can be secured in time for the next Eurogroup meeting of single currency finance ministers on May 22. Athens\u2019 leftist-led government, in a sop to sceptical MPs unnerved by the prospect of further pension cuts and tax increases - concessions made to conclude the long-stalled compliance review at the heart of the country\u2019s latest standoff with creditors - has threatened the measures won\u2019t be implemented if a debt relief deal isn\u2019t cut first even if the unpopular policies aren\u2019t due to be enforced until 2019. Auditors representing Greece\u2019s bailout lenders are expected to return to Athens next week to complete the technical aspects of the review before a staff level agreement is finally wrapped up. Parliament would then legislate the measures before a comprehensive deal, including medium-term debt relief measures, are put before the Eurogroup of finance minister. But as ever nothing is quite as easy as it seems. The IMF, which only this week said it could not participate in the latest bailout programme unless Greece\u2019s debt burden became manageable, projected the country\u2019s primary surplus would be just 2% in 2018, well short of its target of 3.5%. That once again leaves the door wide open for renewed friction between the Fund and euro area member states not least Germany which has made IMF participation a condition of further loan disbursements. In forecasts issued late Wednesday, the IMF attributed Athens\u2019 bigger- than-expected primary surplus of 3.3 percent in 2016 to \u201ctemporary factors.\u201d Greece\u2019s economic recovery is hanging by a thread with many fearing it could be thrown into reverse unless a deal is reached and the uncertainty is ended given the country\u2019s tight \u20ac7.5bn debt repayment deadline early July. But speaking to reporters today, Greece\u2019s government spokesman said the country\u2019s extraordinary over-performance \u201cfinally noted by the Fund\u201d would determine the fiscal path it would take once its current 86 bn euro bailout programme ended in September 2018. The government\u2019s over-arching aim was for primary surpluses to be reduced, he said, so that the Greek economy could regain its potential and achieve the highest possible rates of growth. Over in Washington, world finance ministers and top central bankers are gathering to discuss the state of the global economy. Top of the agenda at the IMF/World Bank Spring Meeting will be the new US government, and its protectionist trade policies. Reuters has more details: \u201cThese meetings will all be about Trump and the implications of his policies for the international agenda,\u201d said Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board official who is now with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank. He added that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde is aiming to \u201csocialize\u201d the new administration to the IMF\u2019s agenda and influence its policy choices. Every politician should have a party trick, and Emmanuel Macron has just tweeted his.... Here\u2019s a lookback at the Harris opinion poll over the last couple of of months: The pound is still having a solid enough day, up 0.2% at $1.28. That\u2019s more than two cents higher than Monday morning, before the snap election news. But Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit isn\u2019t impressed: Some analysts think investors are too relaxed about the French election. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan explains: \u201cMarkets are unprepared for the worst,\u201d notes Athanasios Vamvakidis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThe worst outcome for markets is if Le Pen and M\u00e9lenchon are in the second round, in our view, as markets could start pricing Frexit risks\u201d Fillon\u2019s late revival in the polls could increase the chances that Marine Le Pen fails to win a place in the final run-off. That could trigger a surge in the euro and in share prices, believes Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She says a Macron-Fillon playoff would be the most \u2018market-friendly\u2019 option. A win for Macron with Fillon in second place would restore faith in centrist politics, which has been eroded ever since last year\u2019s Brexit vote in the UK and Trump\u2019s triumph in the US Presidential election. The eradication of the Far Left and the Far Right candidates in the first round would likely see a collective sigh of relief that it is politics as usual in France. This combination for the second round could unleash a surge in the Cac, a sharp drop in French bond yields and a decent move higher in EUR/USD back towards 1.10, we could also see EUR/GBP recover back towards 0.8570 \u2013 a cluster of key resistance levels. Overall, there is a chance that the market has been wrong-footed once again by the polls, and Le Pen is not guaranteed a spot in the second round. If we are correct, then the political premium that has kept the euro range bound in recent months could evaporate, allowing the single currency to stage a decent rally on the back of a victory for the two moderate, pro EU candidates on Sunday night. One of the more surprising elements of the French election is Francois Fillon\u2019s recent revival. After unexpectedly winning the Republican nomination, Fillon\u2019s campaign was badly hurt by allegations that his wife had been paid for work she\u2019d not done. The Penelope Affair, followed by questions over gifts and consultancy fees, seemed likely to sink Fillon\u2019s chances, and his plans for Thatcherite free market reforms. But instead, he\u2019s been regaining ground - and could yet claim a top-two finish on Sunday. If that happens, Fillon can thank his core support, and his move towards increasingly populist, right-wing policies. My colleague Jon Henley explains: Born in the traditionally Catholic Sarthe department west of Paris, Fillon is the son of a history professor mother and solicitor father. With Penelope, whom he met in Le Mans when she was a student on a year abroad, he has raised five children in a 12th-century chateau. He has abstained or voted against laws on equality between men and women and same-sex marriage and is personally opposed to abortion, though he would not try to repeal the 1975 law that legalised it in France. A year after he was first elected as France\u2019s youngest MP, he opposed the 1982 law that effectively legalised homosexuality. A centre-right gay rights group, GayLib, has described his vision of French society as \u201cclearly hostile to LGBT people\u201d. Fillon has pledged to defend France\u2019s \u201cChristian values\u201d. He would ban medically assisted procreation and use of sperm donors for single women and same-sex couples, and reverse some gay adoption rights. He has also promised to set annual quotas on immigration, restrict foreigners\u2019 rights to French nationality, set the age of criminal responsibility at 16, build 16,000 new prison cells and, in foreign policy, develop more positive ties with Russia. The closing days of the campaign have seen Fillon more openly courting a hard-right vote, evoking France\u2019s sovereignty and identity and promising at his Lille rally to crack down hard on immigration and pursue a zero-tolerance policy on radical Islam. The candidates to become France\u2019s next president have been campaigning for months, including a major TV debate earlier this month. But many voters are still uncertain of who they\u2019ll vote for, and their choices could decide the election. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says: The French election looks very close. Although Macron and Le Pen are expected to make it to the second round, all four candidates are close and 30% of voters are said to be still undecided as ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. Two interesting weeks ahead in France.\u201d Pollsters have reported that the number of uncommitted French voters is at unprecedented level. This chart, from Teneo Intelligence, shows how last minute changes of heart could boost, or undermine, the leading candidates: The \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for global financial markets is second-round duel between the equally sharp-tongued Le Pen and Melenchon, says Associated Press\u2019s John Leicester. Victory for either could, in the wake of the Brexit vote, possibly deliver a knockout punch to the EU ambition of ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe because both want to tear up agreements that bind together the 28 EU states. Melenchon says \u201cthe Europe of our dreams is dead.\u201d He proposes \u201cdisobeying treaties from the moment we take power\u201d and negotiating new EU rules followed by a referendum on whether France should leave the bloc it helped found. \u201cWe either change the EU or quit it,\u201d Melenchon\u2019s manifesto says. The \u201ctotalitarian\u201d EU has also long been one of Le Pen\u2019s pet hates and constant target for her virulent nationalist discourse. She wants an in-out referendum on France\u2019s EU membership, a new French franc to replace the common euro currency, and re-imposing French borders to staunch what she describes as out-of-control immigration. Like her father, National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2002, she hopes for an electoral coup by making the runoff. But pollsters suggest that, like him, she would likely lose on May 7 to any of the other top three opponents. Paris\u2019s stock market is on track for its best day since the start of March. The CAC 40 has jumped by 1% today, outperforming the rest of Europe, as investors react to the latest forecasts of a Macron victory. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with BNP Paribas jumping 2.6% and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale gaining 1.9%. Technology and consumer-focused stocks are also up. The FTSE 100 is lagging behind, though, partly due to the rise in the pound this morning. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, explains: The FTSE is weakening once more this morning, as the pound continues its ascent in the wake of Theresa May\u2019s decision to call a snap election in just seven weeks. To many the appreciation of the pound seems counter-intuitive, yet the prospect of a strengthened Tory majority means there is hope that this election could be good for the UK in Brexit negotiations. M&amp;S isn\u2019t the only UK retailer shutting stores. Debenhams has announced plans to close up to 10 shops, and 11 warehouses, as new CEO Sergio Bucher gets to grips with its \u201ctired and old\u201d estate. Newsflash: The government has announced the sale of Britain\u2019s Green Investment Bank to Australian bank Macquarie in a \u00a32.3bn deal (as my colleague Adam Vaughan reported overnight). It\u2019s an unpopular move with environmental activists, who question Macquarie\u2019s commitment to clean energy. Dr Doug Parr, Policy Director at Greenpeace UK, says: \u201cAt a time when the government should be shoring up low carbon industry for post-Brexit Britain, they have given away one of our key tools for advancing green technologies. The hole left by the Green Investment Bank will slow our transition to a clean energy system, set us back on reaching our climate targets, and mean more of the jobs from new sectors will go elsewhere. If the government picks up its pace, the UK could be a world leader in renewable and green technology. But selling a great British success story, which levered private money into eco-projects, to a controversial Australian bank known for asset-stripping, is a disaster. We need investment in the booming clean technology industry in the UK, for skilled jobs, fairer bills and a healthy economy to see us through the next uncertain few years and in to the future.\u201d The FT\u2019s Jim Pickard suspects the deal is being slipped out under the cover of election fever: The euro is climbing higher, now up 0.5% to a new three-week high of $1.077. That\u2019s partly due to general dollar weakness, as well as that French opinion poll suggesting a win for Emmanuel Macron. Retail news: Marks &amp; Spencer is shutting six UK stores, but promising staff that they\u2019ll be offered new positions elsewhere. Here\u2019s the statement. European stock markets will probably fall sharply if the French election delivers a shock result. Marketwatch\u2019s Sara Sj\u00f6lin explains: And here are the two-way risks: A win for either Le Pen or Melenchon would spark a selloff in risk assets and drive French and European equities down 5%-10% by the end of June, Citi said. However, if Macron or Fillon secures the presidency, stocks in Europe could see a 10%-20% rally before the end of the year, they said. The pound is also strengthening this morning, up half a cent at $1.2825 against the US dollar. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever has spotted signs that investors are more confident about UK assets. The yield (or interest rate) on UK gilts (government debt) has fallen in recent weeks, for example, as the price of the bonds has risen. Marine Le Pen\u2019s best hope of victory would come in a run-off against former prime minister Francois Fillon, argues Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence. Barroso believes that many centrist and left-leaning voters might find this choice underwhelming, and not participate in such a second round scenario. He writes: The worst-case scenario in terms of a potential Le Pen victory is a runoff between Fillon and the leader of the National Front. This is especially the case considering the former PM\u2019s recent \u201crightist turn\u201d after he suggested he would include members of an ultra-catholic organization in his administration. Combined with his frequent attacks on the judiciary, this will only make it more difficult for Fillon to credibly moderate his positions in between rounds. The risk is that center-left voters decide to stay at home on 7 May, allowing Le Pen to be elected by voter neglect rather than by voter endorsement. Barroso also agrees that Macron would be a much tougher opponent for Le Pen. This chart confirms that traders have been anxious about the French elections, and the prospect of a eurosceptic winner: Tactical voting will probaly keep Marine Le Pen out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, argues Kit Nicholl, country risk analyst at IHS Global Insight: In a scenario where Le Pen is pitted against Fillon, or more likely, Macron, voters from the moderate left and right are likely to unite in a so-called \u201cRepublican front\u201d, voting tactically to keep the FN out of power. A Le Pen victory is therefore unlikely but still remains possible, particularly as abstention rates will also play a big role. Furthermore, the occurrence of a major terrorist attack, widespread urban riots, or the disclosure of damning information aimed at discrediting Macron would all have the effect of significantly increasing the FN\u2019s share of the vote. The euro has hit its highest level since the end of March this morning. The single currency gained 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.074, after a new opinion poll suggested centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will win the French election. Harris Interactive placed Macron on 25% support ahead of Sunday\u2019s first round of voting, ahead of Marine Le Pen (22%). Republican candidate Francois Fillon (19%) and left-winger Jean-Luc Melenchon (also 19%) followed behind. Harris also see Macron comfortably beating Le Pen in the second round of voting in May. The euro has been under pressure from predictions that either Le Pen or Melenchon (or even both) might contest the run-off, as both are extremely critical of the EU and could potentially trigger Frexit. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political issues continue to occupy the market\u2019s attention today. The first round of the French presidential election is just three days away, so investors are watching closely to see which candidates make it through to the run-off two weeks later. The race looks rather tight, raising concerns that the eurozone could be dragged into another crisis if the more mainstream candidates stumble. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: Volatility in the euro has peaked at its highest since before the June referendum as markets weigh the prospects of either Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc Melenchon \u2013 or both - making the second round. The killer scenario for the euro would be if both candidates make the May 7th runoff as it would raise the very real possibility of France exiting the euro. Current polling gives the nod to Macron and Le Pen, with Macron eventually winning. But with four candidates polling around 20% there is every reason for caution. We\u2019re looking at contingency plans in the event of a Le Pen-Melenchon runoff as this would spark a big selloff in the euro and French government bonds, as well as bank stocks. Britain\u2019s general election also looms over the City, of course, as traders try to calculate the consequences. The latest front pages suggest Theresa May is determined to make Brexit the centrepoint of the campaign: Overnight, Asian shares have been boosted by some solid trade data from Japan. Exports jumped at the fastest pace in two years in March, raising hopes that rising demand from overseas could help the sluggish Japanese economy. There\u2019s plenty of corporate news too, including results from Unilever, Debenhams, and Sky. On the economics side, there\u2019s eurozone construction figures at 10am BST, the weekly US unemployment report at 1.30pm, and eurozone consumer confidence stats at 3pm.",

                "bodyText":"Stock markets surged and the euro jumped sharply after centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron won the first round of the weekend\u2019s French presidential election, easing fears of a victory by the far-right Front National. France\u2019s Cac index climbed more than 4% to a nine-year high, its best daily performance since August 2015, as investors bet that Macron would defeat the other runoff candidate, the FN\u2019s Marine Le Pen on 7 May. The first vote put Macron on 23.75% with Le Pen on 21.53%. The result was seen as the most market-friendly outcome, putting the independent former investment banker in pole position to fend off the anti-EU Le Pen. The euphoric mood spilled over into other stock markets, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 3.3% to a new closing peak and the FTSE 100 recovering 2.1% to 7,264 after last week\u2019s slump in the wake of the UK general election announcement. . The FTSE 250 added more than 1% to hit a record closing high, while in Asia the Nikkei 225 ended up nearly 1.4%. On Wall Street, US markets also rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by about 200 points or nearly 1% by lunchtime and the Nasdaq Composite technology index hitting its best ever level. Banking shares were among the leading gainers across the globe, lifted by the prospect of a more certain economic outlook for the eurozone if the EU-friendly Macron wins the final round of the election. The VIX volatility index \u2013 the so-called fear index \u2013 fell by 22%, its biggest daily drop since the day after Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory last November. Meanwhile, the single currency hit a five-and-a-half month high against the dollar. Although it came off its best levels, it was still up about 1% against the dollar and the pound as European markets closed. Sterling had its worst day against the euro since last October and analysts cautioned the currency was likely to remain volatile before the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday.

The prospect of Macron beating anti-EU far right candidate Marine Le Pen - not to mention the relatively unusual sight of opinion polls making the correct call - gave some relief to investors concerned about the rise of extremism in Europe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This [market reaction] might seem a bit overdone, given Macron was always supposed to win the first round, and there is still a second round to go. Only in two weeks\u2019 time will be able to put thoughts of a Len Pen presidency behind us. However, investors seem buoyed by the consistent record of French polling, one that was reinforced by the result yesterday, and are prepared to move back into risk assets once more. Of course, this hasn\u2019t solved all the other problems, such as North Korea, Syria and the Trump administration\u2019s failure to produce any major reforms, but for now the bears have been forced to get out of the way or risk being trampled in the rush to buy stocks again.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 150.13 points or 2.11% at 7264.68</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 4.14% to 5268.85</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 3.37% to a closing high of 12,454.98</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB closed up 4.77% at 20,684.41</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.76% at 10,766.8</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 1.75% to 683.30</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 211 points or 1.03%.</p> <p>Meanwhile the euro is currently up 1.1% against the dollar and 1.3% against the pound.</p> <p>Here is our updated markets story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/24/stock-markets-surge-after-french-election-result\">Stock markets surge after French election result</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Helena Smith writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The congratulatory message from Tsipras not only underscored the strong alliance between Greece and France, but also how much store Athens sets on Paris\u2019 long-standing support in economic matters. Throughout the seven-year debt crisis, Greece has frequently depended on France\u2019s backing in often fraught negotiations with creditors, not least Berlin.</p> <p>After weeks of tense talks over the country\u2019s latest bailout review, monitors representing lender institutions will return to Athens to resume inspections tomorrow, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas announced today. The aim was to reach an agreement \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d he said, in comments reflecting Europe\u2019s desire to avert another Greek crisis in the run-up to Germany also going to the polls. The inspection tour, which is expected to be wrapped up within weeks, will focus on the \u201ctechnical details\u201d of implementing \u20ac3.6bn worth of further pension cuts and tax hikes, the latter enforced though broad expansion of the tax base.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Highlighting the extraordinary fiscal adjustment Greece has made, Schinas said the EU statistics agency, Eurostat, had confirmed that in 2016 the country\u2019s primary budget surplus far exceeded expectations coming in at 3.9% of GDP (excluding debt servicing costs). The spokesman said the Commission was confident Greece could meet its budget targets in 2017 and 2018.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51677aed92571085855e416e7c9516b078d21538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51677aed92571085855e416e7c9516b078d21538/0_244_7235_4341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek newspapers report the French poll news\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek newspapers report the French poll news</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleftherios Elis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58fe0f6fe4b09033f808c8fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-24T14:50:16.048Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A couple of manufacturing surveys from the US are showing a slight dip in performance.</p> <p>The Dallas Fed manufacturing activity index dipped from 16.9 in March to 16.8 this month, below expectations of a rise to 17.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Chicago Fed national activity index for March fell from a 0.27 increase in February to a 0.08 rise.

                "bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the first round of the French presidential election saw stock markets surge and the euro gain ground against the dollar and pound. The prospect of Macron beating anti-EU far right candidate Marine Le Pen - not to mention the relatively unusual sight of opinion polls making the correct call - gave some relief to investors concerned about the rise of extremism in Europe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said; This [market reaction] might seem a bit overdone, given Macron was always supposed to win the first round, and there is still a second round to go. Only in two weeks\u2019 time will be able to put thoughts of a Len Pen presidency behind us. However, investors seem buoyed by the consistent record of French polling, one that was reinforced by the result yesterday, and are prepared to move back into risk assets once more. Of course, this hasn\u2019t solved all the other problems, such as North Korea, Syria and the Trump administration\u2019s failure to produce any major reforms, but for now the bears have been forced to get out of the way or risk being trampled in the rush to buy stocks again. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 150.13 points or 2.11% at 7264.68 France\u2019s Cac climbed 4.14% to 5268.85 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 3.37% to a closing high of 12,454.98 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB closed up 4.77% at 20,684.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.76% at 10,766.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.75% to 683.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 211 points or 1.03%. Meanwhile the euro is currently up 1.1% against the dollar and 1.3% against the pound. Here is our updated markets story: And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The prospect of Emmanuel Macron becoming France\u2019s next president has prompted the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to call the centrist politician following his first-round win. Helena Smith writes: The congratulatory message from Tsipras not only underscored the strong alliance between Greece and France, but also how much store Athens sets on Paris\u2019 long-standing support in economic matters. Throughout the seven-year debt crisis, Greece has frequently depended on France\u2019s backing in often fraught negotiations with creditors, not least Berlin. After weeks of tense talks over the country\u2019s latest bailout review, monitors representing lender institutions will return to Athens to resume inspections tomorrow, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas announced today. The aim was to reach an agreement \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d he said, in comments reflecting Europe\u2019s desire to avert another Greek crisis in the run-up to Germany also going to the polls. The inspection tour, which is expected to be wrapped up within weeks, will focus on the \u201ctechnical details\u201d of implementing \u20ac3.6bn worth of further pension cuts and tax hikes, the latter enforced though broad expansion of the tax base. Highlighting the extraordinary fiscal adjustment Greece has made, Schinas said the EU statistics agency, Eurostat, had confirmed that in 2016 the country\u2019s primary budget surplus far exceeded expectations coming in at 3.9% of GDP (excluding debt servicing costs). The spokesman said the Commission was confident Greece could meet its budget targets in 2017 and 2018. A couple of manufacturing surveys from the US are showing a slight dip in performance. The Dallas Fed manufacturing activity index dipped from 16.9 in March to 16.8 this month, below expectations of a rise to 17. Meanwhile the Chicago Fed national activity index for March fell from a 0.27 increase in February to a 0.08 rise. The February figure was itself revised down from 0.34. Another sign of the relief among investors following Macron\u2019s first round victory, with the volatility index falling sharply: US markets have followed the global surge in the wake of the French election first round vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 200 points or just over 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite opened up 1.1% at a new record high and the S&amp;P 500 rose around 1%. Here is our French election blog with all the latest developments: Market euphoria following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the first round of the French presidential election may not last, says Forex.com technical analyst Fawad Razaqzada: The euro and stock markets have absolutely surged higher on the back of news Emmanuel Macron secured almost 24% of Sunday\u2019s first-round vote, suggesting he will probably beat Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency. The threat that a Eurosceptic leader will preside over France has therefore diminished sharply. However, the prospects of an unlikely victory for Le Pen remains and that may dampen the enthusiasm expressed by investors today. What\u2019s more, there is always the possibility that the markets may have overreacted to the news. Thus, there is a risk that both the euro and European stock markets may ease back in the days to come, even if the German Dax index has climbed to a new record high level. Time for a quick recap. European stock markets are starting the week with solid gains, after centrist politician Emmanuel Macron took a big step towards becoming France\u2019s next president. The CAC 40 index of top French shares has hit a nine-year high. It is currently up 4.5%, or 227 points, at 5286, its best level since early 2008. Germany\u2019s DAX hit a record high, while the UK FTSE 100 has jumped by 1.8%, back to 7243 points. City experts are united in predicting that Macton will beat Marine Le Pen, who came second in yesterday\u2019s first round of voting, on May 7th. This is calming fears that France could vote to leave the European Union in the next few years. Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, Head of Multi-Asset at NN Investment Partners, says a Macron victory has two important implications for Europe: \u201cFirst, it would substantially reduce the risk that the increasingly strong and broad-based recovery in the European economy is derailed by a political shock. Second, the prospect of stronger rather than weaker cooperation between France and Germany would emerge at the core of Europe, making the region more able to digest new political, institutional and economic challenges in the future.\u201d The euro continues to hold onto its early gains too. It\u2019s currently up 1.25% against the US dollar at $1.0858, half a cent below the five-month high struck overnight. But could investors be too complacent about the French election? Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group thinks that Marine Le Pen will make a close fight of it, and argues that Macron is actually her ideal opponent. He says: While she has maintained hostility to immigration as one of the key elements of the FN\u2019s platform, Le Pen has moved its economic platform considerably further left. By promising to protect French living standards from globalization, she has broadened the party\u2019s reach and made it capable of attracting second-round votes from social conservatives and economic protectionists alike. Almost everything in Macron\u2019s background and his policy platform make it easy for the FN to caricature him as the darling of the pro-EU establishment and of financial markets. They will do this consistently and aggressively over the next two weeks in order to rally the 48% of the vote went to anti-establishment candidates. This does not include Fillon\u2019s 20%. Hartwig Kos, vice-CIO and co-head of multi-asset at SYZ Asset Management says the possibility of Marine Le Pen becoming French president appears to have subsided. That\u2019s because opinion polling has shown Macron would probably secure a larger majority over the National Front leader than, for example, the Republican candidate Francois Fillon (who came third last night). But despite that, Kos is being a little cautious -- after all , shock results are by their very nature hard to spot. As he puts it: \u201cMacron currently leads the opinion polls for the second round by almost 30% \u2013 while Le Pen scored poorly in areas such as Paris, at below 5% in the first round. This clearly improved sentiment and many investors are now more willing to bet on a positive election outcome. We have also started to reposition our portfolios into a more pro-risk stance, recognising that political risks have moved more to the tail than previously expected. Despite this, we have kept some of our hedges intact, as the main characteristic of a tail event is the fact that it is unexpected.\u201d The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead by rallying when trading begins at 2.30pm BST (9.30am in New York). The British pound has shed more than 1% against the euro this morning, as traders push up the single currency. This has taken the euro back to 85p against the pound, recovering its losses since Theresa May called a snap general election a week ago (which pushed the pound up). Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, suspects that sterling could fall further against the euro in the coming weeks. He writes: \u201cEuropean markets soared on Monday morning, with investors confident that centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will become French President in a fortnight. \u201cMacron topped the voting in the first round, and if elected, his pro-EU agenda could continue to stabilise markets and boost the euro in the coming months. \u201cThis could spell bad news for the Brexit-hit pound; the prospect of losing further ground to the Euro may be heightened by uncertainty surrounding June\u2019s General Election, with sterling volatility far from over.\u201d Rating agency Moody\u2019s has just commented on the French presidential election: \u201cMoody\u2019s will assess any credit implications associated with the presidential election once the outcome is known. Fiscal and economic policies are likely to be key rating drivers under the next French presidency given the country\u2019s debt and growth challenges.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the CBI report into British industry, from Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Here\u2019s Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: And here\u2019s Andy Bruce of Reuters: Britain\u2019s factory bosses have reported that 2017 got off to a good start, but there may be tougher times ahead. The CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey shows that export orders for manufacturing goods jumped at the fastest pace in six years, in the three months to April. Orders from outside the EU rose at their fastest ever pace. Domestic orders were also solid, jumping at the fastest rate since July 2014 during the quarter. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief Economist, says UK-manufactured goods are in demand. \u201cUK manufacturers are enjoying strong growth in demand from customers in the UK and overseas, and continue to ramp up production. \u201cExports have surged and firms are at their most optimistic about selling overseas in over four decades. Even so, the combination of the weak pound and recovering commodity prices means that cost pressures continue to build, and manufacturers report no sign of them abating over the near-term.\u201d However.....firms did also report a slowdown in export orders in April alone, after a strong March. That may be a sign that production could slow this summer...... Bloomberg have a rather neat scoreboard showing the state of the markets today. It show that Europe\u2019s stock markets are strongly higher (first column), with most currencies up against the US dollar (second column). Government bond yields have fallen (third column), which means prices have risen, while the cost of insuring said bonds has fallen (fourth column). Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher on this morning\u2019s market action: The gold price has fallen sharply this morning, down 1% to $1,270 per ounce. That\u2019s because investors are ditching safe-haven assets in favour of riskier ones: This chart shows how French shares have risen to their highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says traders are expecting a resounding win for Macron on May 7th: \u201cThe first round of the French Presidential election, as expected has led to second round contest between Macron and Le Pen. However, the fact that Macron currently leads over Le Pen does effectively remove the prospect of a victory for Marine Le Pen and her anti EU agenda. Polls see Macron beating Le Pen by a decisive 60%-40%. Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, agrees that Macron looks like a shoe-in: For the first time in six decades, both mainstream parties were eliminated in the first round, highlighting a sentiment of change that is sweeping across the political landscape of advanced economies. Could Macron \u2013 a centrist political newcomer \u2013 be to France what Trudeau is to Canada. Sunday\u2019s result is consistent with recent polls and our base case expectations. Crucially for investors, the presence of centrist candidate Macron in the second and final round significantly increases the probability of a pro-EU French president; based on the polls we assign an 80% to 85% probability of Macron winning, and the backing of Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon would further strengthen his case Newsflash! The French stock market has now hit its highest level in nine years as the election relief rally gathers pace. The CAC 40 has burst through its April 2015 high, and is now up 4.5% to levels last seen in 2008, before the world economy entered its deepest crisis in decades. Industrial stocks, and financial companies, are in hot demand thanks to optimism that France is unlikely to elect a eurosceptic president. Investors are relieved that far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon didn\u2019t join Marine Le Pen in the second-round. Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management, explains: \u201cThe main worry for investors and traders watching the French election was that voters would be presented with a choice between anti-EU candidates on the left and right in the second round. With roughly 55% backing pro-EU candidates over the weekend and the polls clearly pointing to a Macron victory in the run off with Le Pen, the euro rallied strongly. \u201cIn stocks and bonds, markets were also taking the good news early as French bond yields dropped and stock markets rallied across the board. And in Berlin, Germany\u2019s stock market has hit a record high in the last few minutes. Emmanuel Macron faces a serious challenge to revitalise the French economy, assuming he becomes the next president. One potential hurdle is that his En Marche! party probably won\u2019t win a majority in June\u2019s legislative elections. That means Macron would have to build alliances in the French assembly to actually get things done. Analysts at ABN AMRO have warned their clients that Macon could face \u201cmajor obstacles\u201d. They say: Even presidents with the best intentions have struggled to pass reforms in France. They have been blocked by vested interests, street protests and strikes in the past. Macron could also face the obstacle of not having a parliamentary majority. Under France\u2019s semi-presidential political system, if a president\u2019s party is different to that of the majority of members in parliament, the government is divided \u2013 this is called \u201ccohabitation\u201d. Such a scenario seems likely in the event of a Le Pen, but also a Macron victory. When this happens, the President can become a marginal figure in national politics. In 1998, for example, the Socialist government of PM Lionel Jospin used its parliamentary majority to pass legislation shortening the work week from 39 to 35 hours, against the wishes of the centre-right President Chirac. In another encouraging signal, German investor confidence has hits its highest level in over five years. That\u2019s according to the monthly IFO index, which suggests Germany\u2019s economy is growing strongly right now. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, says investors - and policymakers - should be remain cautious until the presidential run-off is over: \u201cMarkets will be buoyed by the positive outcome of the French election last night, with the centrist Emmanuel Macron going on to face the far right Marine Le Pen. This is not just because Macron is likely to win. Concerns over polling reliability and the turnout rate have been allayed after Sunday\u2019s strong figures and markets reacted positively to the result in Asian trading this morning, with the euro up against the US dollar and Japanese yen and French bonds performing well. \u201cHowever, Le Pen could still potentially win the second round. It is probably too early for markets to see a big relief rally just yet or indeed, for the ECB to send any signals on tapering its bond purchase programme this week. The focus now will be on whether Le Pen changes her anti-EU messages in the next few days, with the Le Pen-Macron debate scheduled for 3 May.\u201d Emmanuel Macron vs Marine Le Pen was the market\u2019s preferred outcome, says John Wyn-Evans of Investec Wealth &amp; Investment. Like most City experts, Wyn-Evans also expects Macron to win on May 7th. His policies cleverly appeal to both sides of the political spectrum, and they are succinctly described by the Financial Times as a \u201cbusiness-friendly agenda coupled with Nordic-style welfarism\u201d, encompassing, for example, labour market deregulation, lower corporation tax, and no social security contributions for those on the minimum wage. He is also a strong supporter of the European Union, although a full exposition of his EU policies might have to wait until we know who wins the German election later this year. Analysts at investment group BlackRock have warned investors not to get carried away ahead of the second round of voting, in two weekend\u2019s time. They say: Business-friendly and pro-European Macron, who has maintained a large winning margin in head-tohead polls with Le Pen, can now build on his momentum. Other candidates on both the left and right said they would vote for Macron while issuing strong statements against the National Front. We see markets pricing in some remaining political risk, given the potential for surprises in the next two weeks. Any significant shift toward Le Pen in the polls could dampen investor sentiment due to her anti-euro stance. But right now, the CAC 40 index of leading French shares is sitting proudly at a two-year high: DIY group Kingfisher is leading the rally in London, up 5.2%. It\u2019s closely exposed to the French economy, through its Castorama chain. The Macron relief rally is also driving shares up in London. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 130 points, or 1.75%, in early trading to 7238 points. Financial stocks are (unsurprisingly) driving the rally, with Barclays up 4%, Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 3%. Bank shares are jumping across Europe this morning: Other European stock markets are also up strongly, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 2%. Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as traders react to last night\u2019s French election. In Paris the CAC 40 has jumped by 4% to its highest level since April 2015. Bank shares are leading the rally, with Societe Generale, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas up by around 10% each. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says traders are cheering the news that Macron and Le Pen have progressed to the second round run-off of the French presidential election, adding: The assumption is that centrist Macron is victorious in a fortnight\u2019s time, picking up supporters of Fillon, Hamon and M\u00e9lenchon. This chart explains why investors are so confident that Macron will become the next French president in two weeks: Here\u2019s Jon Henley\u2019s head-to-head guide to the two candidates who will contest the run-off in a fortnight: France\u2019s government bonds are rallying hard in early trading, in another sign of relief about last night\u2019s election results. This means the gap between French and German borrowing costs has narrowed sharply, showing that investors are more confident about lending to Paris. That\u2019s because the threat of France leaving the euro has now waned, given Macron\u2019s pro-European credentials. France\u2019s stock market is tipped to rocket this morning, quite possibly by more than 4%. That\u2019s because the \u2018nightmare scenario\u2019 of Marine Le Pen becoming French president appears to have been squashed, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: With pollsters and analysts giving the FN candidate virtually no chance in the second round against Macron, those really big worries that many had coming into this election - the risk of \u2018Frexit\u2019 and a breakup of the Eurozone - have definitely subsided. But they have not vanished. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A wave of relief is sweeping through the markets this morning, pushing the euro up and triggering a wave of buying. The first round of the French election delivered the result that most investors were hoping for, calming fears that the eurozone faced another threat to its existence. In a massive snub to the established parties, the presidency will be contested between centrist Emmanuel Macron and National Front leader Marine Le Pen. And there\u2019s a widespread expectation that Macron is ready to march into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The euro spiked to a five-month high over $1.09 when the polls closed last night, and forecasters correctly predicted that Macron had won first place. Most of the defeated candidates have already thrown their support behind Macron, and he is heavily odd-on to become the next French president. If you missed last night\u2019s excitement, let our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis explain: The independent centrist Emmanuel Macron has topped the first round of the French presidential election and according to projections will face the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen in a standoff marked by anti-establishment angerthat knocked France\u2019s traditional political parties out of the race. Macron topped Sunday\u2019s first round with 23.9% of votes, slightly ahead of Le Pen with 21.4%, according to near-final results from the interior ministry. Macron, 39, a political novice, now becomes the favourite to be elected as France\u2019s next president. He is the youngest ever French presidential hopeful and has never run for election before. After the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the US vote for the political novice Donald Trump as president, the French presidential race is the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo. The French election is the main discussion point in the markets today, but there are a couple of other things on the agenda. 9am: German IFO business confidence report for April 11am: The CBI\u2019s survey of UK industrial trends in April",

The administration\u2019s humiliating defeat, at the hands of its own party, over its plans to repeal and replace Obamacare have shown the limits of his authority. When Trump came out in support of Bill O\u2019Reilly, Fox News\u2019s fallen idol, O\u2019Reilly still lost his job. Already some business leaders, even those with terrible reputations (that\u2019s you Uber\u2019s Travis Kalanick) have dropped out of Trump\u2019s business advisory council, lest their proximity be read as approval. Thanks to the supreme court, corporations are people too and as the fight for equal bathroom rights for transgender people in North Carolina has shown, corporations are increasingly more liberal in their views than the Trump administration. On issues such as the environment, women\u2019s rights, immigration and the treatment of the LGBTQ community, it\u2019s not hard to see companies increasingly siding with consumers and activists against the Trump administration (especially if the president\u2019s poll numbers keep falling). But while the president may look less powerful 100 days on, business has not forgotten what Potus represents. Rihanna may have 71 million followers on Twitter compared with Trump\u2019s 6.6m but she doesn\u2019t have the nuclear codes. Foreign policy remains the great uncertainty as Trump exits his \u201choneymoon\u201d. He has softened the rhetoric on China but is still insisting on his border wall, has bombed Syria and made worrying noises about North Korea. One hundred days in, business may be taking Trump a little less seriously at home \u2013 for now, overseas issues look more worrying. All that could change in a tweet. This is a president who likes surprises, and business hates surprises.",

But with some concerns that there is a chance far right candidate Marine Le Pen could still defeat Macron, the gains in Europe were subdued.

First, impressive updates from McDonald\u2019s, which saw some super-sized, all day breakfast-charged like-for-like sales, and Caterpillar, which posted Q1 EPS of $1.28 against the 62 cents expected, added a chunk of growth, the companies climbing 4.1% and 6.4% respectively. Secondly, and more importantly, investors are getting all hot under the collar for the promised reveal of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan tomorrow, an announcement abuzz with the President\u2019s trademark haphazardness.</p> <p>These US gains ensured that Europe remained buoyant. Though it couldn\u2019t re-cross 12500, the DAX added another 20 points, while the CAC rose just shy of half a percent as investors continued to cheer the likelihood of a Macron presidency.</p> <p>As for the FTSE, it maintained its 0.3% increase as the day went on, keeping the index a smidge below 7300. Sterling, meanwhile, kept its head above 1.28 against the dollar with a 0.2% rise, but lost even more ground against the euro, falling to a fresh fortnightly low after dropping 0.3%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ff58f8e4b08d339d361adb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-25T14:14:34.531Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow hits 21,000 again</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached 21,000 for the first time since the middle of March, on a mixture of positivity over the French election, a number of good corporate results and anticipation for Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ff5887e4b01972138ef4b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-25T14:10:50.002Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In other US data, single family home sales jumped to an eight month high in March.</p> <p>Sales rose 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000 units, but February\u2019s figure was revised down from 592,000 to 587,000.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ff56dce4b0e81396c868de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-25T14:08:32.793Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US consumer confidence falls in April</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US consumers were less confident than expected in April, partly due to concerns about the jobs market.</p> <p>The Conference Board consumer confidence index came in at 120.3 in April, below the 122.5 that analysts had been expecting.

More details are due at the Wednesday\u2019s announcement.

The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.15% or 10.96 points at 7275.64 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.17% to 5277.88 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.1% to 12,467.04 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.59% better at 20,805.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 10,783.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.05% to 697.32 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 234 points or 1.1%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the day\u2019s market moves, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: The Macron-move was joined by a Trump and earnings-inspired surge from the Dow Jones this afternoon. There were two main reasons for the Dow\u2019s 200 point jump after the bell... First, impressive updates from McDonald\u2019s, which saw some super-sized, all day breakfast-charged like-for-like sales, and Caterpillar, which posted Q1 EPS of $1.28 against the 62 cents expected, added a chunk of growth, the companies climbing 4.1% and 6.4% respectively. Secondly, and more importantly, investors are getting all hot under the collar for the promised reveal of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan tomorrow, an announcement abuzz with the President\u2019s trademark haphazardness. These US gains ensured that Europe remained buoyant. Though it couldn\u2019t re-cross 12500, the DAX added another 20 points, while the CAC rose just shy of half a percent as investors continued to cheer the likelihood of a Macron presidency. As for the FTSE, it maintained its 0.3% increase as the day went on, keeping the index a smidge below 7300. Sterling, meanwhile, kept its head above 1.28 against the dollar with a 0.2% rise, but lost even more ground against the euro, falling to a fresh fortnightly low after dropping 0.3%. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached 21,000 for the first time since the middle of March, on a mixture of positivity over the French election, a number of good corporate results and anticipation for Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. In other US data, single family home sales jumped to an eight month high in March. Sales rose 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000 units, but February\u2019s figure was revised down from 592,000 to 587,000. US consumers were less confident than expected in April, partly due to concerns about the jobs market. The Conference Board consumer confidence index came in at 120.3 in April, below the 122.5 that analysts had been expecting. The March figure was revised down from 125.6 to 124.9. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in April after increasing sharply over the past two months, but still remains at strong levels. Consumers assessed current business conditions and, to a lesser extent, the labor market less favorably than in March. Looking ahead, consumers were somewhat less optimistic about the short-term outlook for business conditions, employment and income prospects. Despite April\u2019s decline, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the months ahead. On the jobs market, the Conference Board added: Consumers\u2019 assessment of the labor market was moderately less favorable. Those stating jobs are \u201cplentiful\u201d declined from 31.8 percent to 30.8 percent, while those claiming jobs are \u201chard to get\u201d was virtually unchanged at 19.1 percent. The Nasdaq Composite first hit 5000 back in 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom. But the subsequent bust meant it has taken 17 years for the index to add the next 1000 points to get to 6000. US markets have again joined the global optimism, with the technology led Nasdaq Composite hitting 6000 for the first time. The chances of Emmanuel Macron winning the French presidential election at the expense of far right rival Marine Le Pen has pushed share prices higher, while investors are also anticipating US president Donald Trump\u2019s tax announcement. Trump is said to be about to announce more details of his plans on Wednesday, including a possible cut to corporation tax to 15%. Meanwhile a host of positive results, notably from McDonalds and Caterpillar, have also provided support. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 190 points or 0.9% better while Nasdaq opened up 0.34% at 6004 and the S&amp;P 500 was up a similar amount. Ahead of the Wall Street open, new figures show that US house prices rose more quickly than expected in February. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Schiller index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.9% in February, compared to 5.7% in January and expectations of 5.7% again. This was the biggest year on year increase since July 2014. David M. Blitzer of the index compilers said: \u201cThere are still relatively few existing homes listed for sale and the small 3.8 month supply is supporting the recent price increases. Housing affordability has declined since 2012 as the pressure of higher prices has been a larger factor than stable to lower mortgage rates.\u201d The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in under 40 minutes. That\u2019s thanks to fast food chain McDonald\u2019s, and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar. Both companies have beaten analyst forecasts for sales and profits today. Bad news for the UK: 300 jobs are reportedly being cut at Nestle. The Swiss chocolate maker is also moving production of its Blue Riband bar to Poland, unions say. Over in Berlin, Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka is rubbing shoulders with some of the world\u2019s most powerful women, at the W20 women\u2019s empowerment summit. The event, backed by the G20 group of advanced economies, is aiming to increase women\u2019s economic empowerment. Its motto is: \u201cInspiring women: scaling up women\u2019s entrepreneurship\u201d The W20 wants to help more women into work, raise the value of work traditionally carried out by women, help more to become entrepreneurs, and close the digital gender divide. Ivanka was invited by German chancellor Angela Merkel; seemingly as part of Merkel\u2019s attempt to build bridges with the new US government. Buzzfeed\u2019s Jina Moore reports that president Trump\u2019s attitudes to women have come up.... Angela Merkel, though, is focusing on Ivanka Trump\u2019s business know-how: Ivanka seems to have received a somewhat bracing reception, tweets Politico\u2019s Annie Karn: NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson concurs: This wave of investor optimism is jolly good news for the world\u2019s richest men and women. Bloomberg has calculated that Europe\u2019s billionaires added $27.5bn to their collective fortunes (on paper, anyway), thanks to the jump in share prices on Monday. Amancio Ortega Gaona, the Spanish retail magnate behind the Zara chain, became $2.7bn richer - overtaking Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos to become the world\u2019s second richest person, Bloomberg say: The latest Guardian Brexit Dashboard is out, showing the state of Britain\u2019s economy since last June\u2019s EU referendum. And the warning light next to \u2018living standards\u2019 is flashing alarmingly, as rising inflation hits household incomes. Katie Allen, who compiles the Dashboard, explains that the The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote and a mood of uncertainty among employers has hit household budgets creating a tough economic backdrop for Theresa May\u2019s snap election, a Guardian analysis shows. The prime minister will be hoping the resilience seen in the UK economy in the wake of last summer\u2019s referendum will hold over the coming months now that she has called an election for this June. But the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows living standards are already falling as rising prices outpace meagre pay growth. That bodes ill for an economy reliant on household spending and the latest indicators from Britain\u2019s retail and leisure industries suggest they are feeling the effects of a tightening consumer squeeze. The export sector has failed to offset that domestic drag and GDP figures due this week are expected to show the economy slowed markedly at the start of this year. Here\u2019s the full report: European stock markets are holding onto this morning\u2019s gains, keeping the MSCI World Index at record levels. In London, the FTSE 100 is 20 points higher, while France\u2019s CAC has also added to Monday\u2019s 4% surge. Connor Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says the market\u2019s \u201clove affair\u201d with Macron helped markets to record highs. But.... The latest opinion polls have Macron crushing Le Pen with more than 60% of the vote; however, the far right has continually beaten the odds in the last year and a half, so there could still be some more volatility in store before May\u2019s second election. The latest opinion polls suggests that Emmanuel Macron would win comfortably on May 7th. BUT.... my colleague Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de says it\u2019s \u201cdelusional and dangerous\u201d to assume the race is over. Turnout in the second round could be low if people think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, for example. Or Marine Le Pen could win more votes from the defeated candidates than Macron - particularly as left-wing candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon hasn\u2019t yet backed either side. She explains: If playing with fire in politics means anything, this was it. M\u00e9lenchon spoke dismissively of both, as if unable or unwilling to see the difference. He announced that his radical left movement, France Unbowed, would organise an online \u201cconsultation\u201d designed to determine its position ahead of the run-off. It was as bewildering as it was disgraceful. And it was a deliberate attempt to deny or minimise what is now at play. Yet the choice France now faces could not be more clear-cut: an open, liberal message versus a closed, illiberal one. A platform of inclusiveness versus one of bigotry and nationalist hatred. A promise to strengthen the European project through reform versus a pledge to close borders, introduce protectionism and pull out of Euro-Atlantic structures. It\u2019s also a choice between a candidate who resolutely criticises President Putin and his worldview, and one who consistently panders to the Russian autocrat and has been financially dependent on his networks. In the bond markets, the gap between German and French borrowing costs has narrowed this morning, extending Monday\u2019s moves. That shows investors are less anxious about France quitting the eurozone - a possibility if Marine Le Pen becomes French president. Financial market volatility has slumped since the French election results were released on Sunday night. That shows that investors are pleased that Emmanuel Macron will fight Marine Le Pen for the presidency. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote bank has the details: The most interesting result of the French election vote was the collapse of volatility indicators globally. The VIX index declined -19% from 15.30 while one-month implied volatility in the euro-US dollar exchange rate fell to 8.20 from 13.45. The JP Morgan G7 volatility index fell to 8.03, a level not seen since November 2014. Let\u2019s get back to the stock market rally! And Donald Trump can take some credit for the rise in share prices this week. Yesterday, a White House official revealed that the president is seeking to slash US corporation tax to just 15%, from 35% today. Such a dramatic cut goes further than current proposals on Capitol Hill, and would deliver on a key Trump campaign pledge (making it something of a collector\u2019s item at this early stage of the presidency...). Apparently, Trump\u2019s advisors believe that cutting taxes on companies would pay for itself in the long-run by encouraging economic activity and spurring growth. That\u2019s debatable, depending where you think we are on the Laffer Curve (and if you believe in it at all). In the short run, though, such a move would create a big hole in the US budget - driving its deficit and national debt higher, and possibly creating a major row with Congress. But the scent of tax cuts is having its usual effect on investors, helping to push shares higher. Ipek Ozkrdeskaya of London Capital Markets explains: The US stocks were resuscitated after the White House announced that the US corporate taxes will be cut by 15% as part of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018major\u2019 fiscal plans. According to the latest news, the personal income taxes will also be reduced. More details are due at the Wednesday\u2019s announcement. Donald Trump will prioritize the tax cuts over the budget deficit. In this respect, the US debt ceiling should be adjusted to avoid an eventual government shutdown. Nevertheless, the early highlights regarding the very much expected tax reforms pleased the private sector investors. The optimism is back in the US markets. Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation has tweeted a handy chart, showing how the UK deficit has fallen over the last few years: But.... the independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts borrowing will jump to \u00a358bn in the current financial year. There\u2019s no room for complacency about the state of Britain\u2019s public finances, just because the deficit fell to \u00a352bn last year. So argues John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, who fears that borrowing could be driven up again. He says: A number of one-off factors relating to the timing of tax receipts and spending flattered the deficit figures for 2016/17 but are likely to be reversed in 2017/18. \u201cHigher inflation will also act as a drag on growth over the next year while boosting some benefit payments that are linked to prices. So the improvement in the deficit could well be reversed in the coming financial year as the OBR predicted. \u201cIn the longer term an ageing population and rising healthcare costs will also put pressure on the public finances. So while the deficit is now approaching a more sustainable level, there will still be some tough choices ahead on tax and spending for the next government.\u201d Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual public deficit has fallen to its lowest level in almost a decade. The UK borrowed \u00a352bn in the 2016-17 financial year, new figures show. That\u2019s slightly above the \u00a351.7bn predicted in last month\u2019s budget, but around \u00a320bn or 28% lower than the previous year. This is the smallest annual deficit since 2007-08, and the start of the financial crisis which rocked Britain\u2019s financial sector and triggered a deep recession. Disappointingly, March\u2019s deficit rose by \u00a3800m to \u00a35.1bn, rather larger than expected. And Britain\u2019s total national debt is now around \u00a31.7 trillion. Markets do have a strong history of getting carried away by political events, especially if their favourite candidate is doing well. So we should treat this rally with some caution, as Emmanuel Macron hasn\u2019t yet proved he can deliver on his promises. The first challenges will be to win seats in the French national assembly in June. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says there is a significant risk that Macron struggles to implement a reform agenda in France. She writes: Equity markets are putting a lot of faith into Macron, he first has to win the second round of the French Presidential election and get the keys to the Elysee Palace, but then his newly formed party has to do well in the National Assembly elections in June. French banks have been the immediate beneficiaries to Macron\u2019s strong showing in the first round of the vote. Societe General, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole rose 9.5%, 7.5% and 10.8% respectively on Monday. This is to be expected, as they are most correlated to the economy and are likely to salute a pro-business Presidential candidate. However, they are also most at risk if Macron\u2019s En Marche! Party do not get enough seats in the National Assembly elections in two months\u2019 time, which would make it hard for Macron to get his pro-growth agenda into action. Thus, European political risk is not at bay completely. The French presidential rate took another twist last night, when Marine Le Pen announced she was stepping aside as leader of the National Front. That may help her win support from voters who aren\u2019t impressed by Macron, but can\u2019t stomach placing a cross next to a party with such a toxic past. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says it\u2019s a clever idea, but not enough to win the second round of voting. Optimism over the French election is pushing the euro up this morning. It\u2019s gained 0.2% to $1.089, close to the five-month high struck on Sunday night. Good news for the next French president -- the country\u2019s business leaders are at their most optimistic since 2011. Bullish investors are in \u201cfirm control\u201d of the markets right now, says Chris Weston of IG. Weston writes: Despite concerns of elevated valuation, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, the fact the MSCI World index is at an all-time high is remarkable, especially when we think that we haven\u2019t seen a 2% pullback for 120 trading sessions. The \u201chighly likely\u201d prospect of Emmanuel Macron becoming France\u2019s next president is encouraging traders to buy European shares and French bonds, and driving down the cost of insuring against France defaulting on its debts, he adds. India\u2019s main stock index, the NSE Nifty, has swept to a new all-time high today. Tirthankar Patnaik, India strategist at Mizuho Bank, explains: \u201cGlobal markets have been very positive on news from the French election,\u201d More here: Nifty hits record high; rupee strengthens Markets are in a \u201cparty mood\u201d this morning thanks to last Sunday\u2019s French elections, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. It now appears that investors are confident that Macron will be France\u2019s next president and will win the battle on 7 May easily. Investors who lost confidence in pollsters after they failed to predict the outcomes of the U.S. elections and Brexit vote are all of a sudden viewing them as credible sources of information again... The importance of this one single event was reflected in asset classes across the globe, but whether this rally will have legs depends on how big Macron wins. Macron would need to win by a margin of more than 60% in the second round to unite a divided country and ensure that the spread of populism ends in France. Frankfurt traders have pushed the German DAZ to new record highs: European stock markets are inching higher this morning, adding to yesterday\u2019s strong rally. The French CAC, German DAX and UK FTSE 100 have all gained a little ground in early trading, helping to send global markets to record levels. Global stock markets have hit their highest ever levels this morning, as relief over the French presidential election continues to sweep through trading floors. The MSCI World Index - a broad measure of markets around the globe - has hit an all-time high today, for the second session running. The rally is driven by expectations that Emmanuel Macron will become France\u2019s next president, calming fears that the European Union could be dragged into another political crisis. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with the Japanese market gaining over 1%, and Hong Kong and India also up. Investor are reacting to poll suggesting that Macron would comfortably beat his opponent, Marine Le Pen Yesterday, European markets surged after Macron claimed a place in the run-off, with France\u2019s CAC leaping by 4% to a nine year high. Guy Foster, Head of Research at Brewin Dolphin, agrees that Macron looks highly likely to succeed Francois Hollande. He says: \u201cFollowing the first-round election we are now in a crucial fortnight for France in which the impact of terror events, further WikiLeaks\u2019 disclosures or potential scandals are multiplied by the fact that if Macron the centrist doesn\u2019t win, Le Pen the extremist will. Nevertheless, the chances of an Emmanuel Macron victory in the run-off election are very high indeed. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suggests that investors may be being too optimistic about Macron\u2019s ability to change France. Markets are surmising that Emmanuel Macron is a dead certainty to be French President in two weeks\u2019 time, and while this is probably the most benign outcome at a time of rising populism it completely overlooks the challenges facing the new French President when he or she takes office on May 8th. For a start while Mr Macron is an outsider from the established political order, he will still be viewed by the majority of the 40% of French people who voted for anti-Euro candidates, as very much part of the same elite who he has helped to push to one side in this particular vote, which means he will be presiding over a country very much ill at ease with itself. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to discover how much Britain was forced to borrow to meet its financial needs last year, and whether it hit its targets. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics publishes the public finance figures for March. That will show the deficit last month, and across the full 2016-17 financial year. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that government borrowing would hit \u00a351.7bn this year. That was down from the \u00a368.2bn forecast in November, and much better than the \u00a371bn borrowed in 2015-16. As of last month, Britain had borrowed around \u00a347.8bn, implying that the nation will have tapped the markets for another \u00a33bn or so in March. With an election looming, the UK government will surely hail the figures as proof that it is getting the deficit down. But, Britain\u2019s total debt pile is still going up, of course - as there\u2019s no prospect of an actual surplus in the next few years. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Macro data this morning includes March UK Public Finances with net borrowing set to continue to rise following January\u2019s seasonal drop on corporation tax receipts and accounting revisions. Also coming up today... Investors will be watching France closely, ahead of the presidential run-off between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen on May 7th. In the City, hotels and coffee chain Whitbread, flooring company Carpetright, wealth manager St James\u2019s Place and financial services group Virgin Money are all reporting results.",

From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>With the timing of a maestro, Greece\u2019s leftist leader used the first day of reactivated bailout talks to deliver a stern message: without promised debt relief the pension cuts and tax hikes Athens has now agreed to as part of a bigger package to unlock further emergency loans will never be enforced. </p> <p>In a live TV interview aired late Tuesday, Tsipras said it was Greece\u2019s right as \u201cas sovereign government\u201d to reverse the measures (the equivalent of 2 % of GDP and due to be enacted as of 1.1.2019) if lenders didn\u2019t also honour pledges to offer medium-term debt relief that would allow the economy to breathe. </p> <p>\u201cThey will not be implemented if we do not have a solution to the debt,\u201d he told ANT 1 TV. While the controversial cuts worth \u20ac3.6bn would be approved by parliament in the coming weeks, Tsipras insisted it was within Greece\u2019s sovereign right \u201cto take back something that had been voted if the agreement wasn\u2019t upheld.\u201d </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8bf0670110dd0ffb0c75251f6cebabb0e57bfb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8bf0670110dd0ffb0c75251f6cebabb0e57bfb4/74_208_4204_2524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Predicting that the progress review would be completed in time for the next eurogroup on May 22 \u2013 averting the prospect of crisis being replayed when Greece is called to meet \u20ac7.5bn of maturing debt in July \u2013 Tsipras argued that the review was no ordinary report card but part of a much broader agreement that would allow the country to finally recover from eight years of crisis. </p> <p>While Athens had been forced to make concessions, it had also won the ability to enforce \u201ccounter measures\u201d to offset losses when Greece hit budget targets and secured valuable labour rights that the IMF had wanted to abolish. \u201cWe must not see this review as a review that only concerns the bailout programme.

Yet this hyperbole was treated as just that by the Dow Jones, which nudged a mere 0.1% higher after the bell. Even the dollar was nonplussed, maintaining 0.3% and 0.5% rises against the euro and Japanese yen respectively while sitting flat against sterling.</p> <p>The fact investors failed to react to the Treasury Sec\u2019s headline tax cut announcement suggests that they are looking for more detail, especially the red flags that may cause any proposed bill to go the same way as Trump\u2019s healthcare reforms.

If taxes are slashed then some large US firms may re-base themselves back in the US to take advantage of the 15% rate, which might encourage them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities such as share buy-backs, larger dividends etc.</p> <p>However, stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The pesky debt ceiling remains crucial problem for Congress</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem for the Republican -controlled Congress is the debt ceiling, which was breached back in March but has been massaged by some accounting measures until the end of this month. Congress is trying to pass a budget that will fund the Federal Government from 28th April, however, an unfunded tax cut from the Trump administration could add to the pressure on the debt ceiling going forward.</p> <p>Thus, Republicans have to balance their desire to reduce the Budget deficit, with their desire to boost the economy with a large cut to the corporate tax rate. If they do the latter, as many expect, then this could be a green light for US stock markets.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Infrastructure plan, what infrastructure plan?</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This makes Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan, which has been suspiciously absent from the coverage of the tax blueprint, very unlikely to go ahead. The Trump team is likely to focus on the fact a tax cut can pay for itself and create jobs, but can it do that at the same pace of a large government-spending programme?</p> <p>On balance, we expect markets to outperform in the coming days if key members of Congress throw their weight behind Trump\u2019s tax proposals. But, if there are any signs that this won\u2019t get through the US legislature, then we could see big declines for US stocks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5900540fe4b08d339d361e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T08:04:20.447Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets will probably have closed before we hear details of Trump\u2019s tax proposals.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/finance/330588-mnuchin-cohn-expected-to-roll-out-trump-tax-plan\">According to The Hill</a>, an announcement is expected at 1.30pm Washington time, or 6.30pm BST.</p> <p>They also predict that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn will present the plans;<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/trump-team-to-brief-senators-on-north-korea-at-white-house-10851205\"> Trump is busy holding a session on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T09:20:32.170Z\">at 10.20am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-590050fee4b0e81396c86c6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T07:52:16.834Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After two solid days, European stock markets are taking a little breather.</p> <p>The UK, French and German indices have all dipped in early trading:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d0f93f31e43ec5d5b2b46f30583afe2240ad85b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d0f93f31e43ec5d5b2b46f30583afe2240ad85b/0_0_919_287/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets tis morning\" width=\"500\" height=\"156\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59004cc9e4b01972138ef82d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T07:38:46.660Z\">8.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms plans are the number one issue in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets.</strong></p> <p>He sounds a little sceptical about the whole thing, though:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Currently, one major aspect of his plan which everyone is talking about is the corporate rate tax cut to 15% from its current rate of 35%.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all from us; thanks for reading and commenting! GW Steven Mnuchin\u2019s claim that faster economic growth would help fund these tax cuts (see here) has been rubbished by one former White House staffer. CNBC explains: \u201cThis idea that growth can pay for these kinds of huge tax cuts is operating in fairyland,\u201d former Clinton administration budget director Leon Panetta told MSNBC on Wednesday. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t work, so if you\u2019re going to do a tax cut, then show how you\u2019re paying for it.\u201d Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s tax announcement (with links to the key points in this liveblog) Trump\u2019s \u2018huge tax cut for the rich\u2019 would slash taxes for businesses and wealthy The Trump administration unveiled what it called the biggest tax cuts \u201cin history\u201d on Wednesday in a move that will simplify the US tax system, slash taxes for businesses large and small (including his own), eliminate inheritance taxes and set the president on a collision course with Congress over the likely $2tn-plus cost of the proposal. Critics immediately called it \u201cbasically a huge tax cut for the rich\u201d. The plan would cut the US\u2019s individual income tax brackets from seven to three (10%, 25% and 35%) and slash US corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%. \u201cWe have a once in a generation opportunity to do something really big,\u201d said Gary Cohn, chief economic adviser to Donald Trump. \u201cThis is about growing the economy, creating jobs.\u201d Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, were short on details of the plan that, if passed, would be the largest overhaul of the US tax system since the Reagan era. \u201cWe are moving as quickly as we can,\u201d said Mnuchin. The announcement comes amid a continuing row over Trump\u2019s own taxes, with members of his own party asking for him to release his returns before pressing ahead with tax reforms. Mnuchin said on Wednesday that Trump \u201chas no intention\u201d of releasing his tax returns to the public. As well as slashing costs for his own businesses, the new proposals will also cut the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a tax designed to stop the super-wealthy from taking so many tax deductions that they avoid paying anything. Leaked documents have shown that in 2005 Trump paid $31m in tax thanks to the AMT. Mnuchin and Cohn were pressed on how Trump would benefit from the proposals but avoided the questions. \u201cWhat this is about is creating job and economic growth,\u201d Mnuchin said. Mnuchin described the proposals as \u201cthe biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country\u201d.... Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s full story: The US stock market has greeted the plan with a shrug. The Dow Jones industrial average is up just 37 points, or 0.2%, with similar small gains on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. That\u2019s because some of the details had already leaked, so were \u2018priced in\u2019, and also because it\u2019s not clear that the plan can really be implemented. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Stocks pared gains, sliding as the \u2018details\u2019 were announced, while the dollar also handed back gains. For all the hype, this just wasn\u2019t quite enough to send everything skyward.... We have to factor in considerable risk that the president won\u2019t get his way on tax and must be sceptical about whether the package will make it through the legislature in its current guise. Economics professor Justin Wolfers is also sceptical that this plan can get approved. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t appear to pay for itself or appeal to Democrats on Capitol Hill. Analysts at Capital Economics are sceptical that the House and the Senate will approve this plan: The \u201cnew\u201d tax plan that the White House unveiled today looks a lot like President Donald Trump\u2019s old economic plan from the election campaign, with deep cuts to corporate and individual tax rates. Even with dynamic scoring, however, the old plan was expected to increase the Federal budget deficit by $7trn over the next decade. For that reason alone, this plan is never getting approved by Congress, particularly not through a budget reconciliation that requires ten-year revenue neutrality. Donald Trump\u2019s historic tax reform plan actually fits on a single sheet of paper, with just a dozen key bullet points: Here\u2019s a video clip of Steven Mnuchin being quizzed about Donald Trump\u2019s elusive tax returns: Q: Analysis of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns from 2005 show that without the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) he would have only paid \u00a35.3m of tax.. So doesn\u2019t that show that these tax reforms will benefit the president and his companies? This plan is about \u201ccreating jobs and creating economic growth\u201d, Mnuchin insists. We\u2019re talking about massive tax cuts, massive tax reforms, simplifying the system. The AMT is just a \u201cthird complicated set of rules\u201d, he insists [explainer: AMT is a supplementary income tax aimed at preventing the richest people avoiding tax] And that\u2019s the end of the session -- Spicer, Cohn and Mnuchin exit smartly, as a reporter shouts whether Trump might yet change his mind about releasing his tax returns. Q: Will these plans mean president Trump pays more or less tax? I can\u2019t comment on the president\u2019s tax situation since I don\u2019t have access to that, Mnuchin smiles. Our objective is the reduction in taxes is offset by significant reductionin deductions and other items. So the effective tax rate is what we\u2019re focused on, he adds. Q: What does this proposal mean for American families watching from home? It means a tax cut, national economics director Gary Cohn promises. Q: How much? We\u2019ll let you know as soon as the final details are agreed, Cohn promises. The elephant in the room rears its trunk... Q: Will the president release his tax returns? Trump has \u201cno intention\u201d of releasing his tax returns, Mnuchin replies. He\u2019s released \u201cplenty of information....I think the US population has plenty of information.\u201d Q: This is just one page - just a statement of principles. When do we see full details? We\u2019re working as fast as we can, Mnuchin replies. Q: When would the Death Tax be repealed? Our initial proposal is to phase it out immediately, as son as this new tax package is passed into law, Cohn replies. Q: Is there a danger that Republicans won\u2019t support this package, as with Trump\u2019s healthcare reforms? There is a lot of desire from everyone to reform the tax system, Mnuchin replies. We have agreement on the core principles of this package. Q: Will this package pay for itself? We\u2019re working on the details, says Mnuchin, before promising: This will pay for itself with extra growth, and by reducing tax deductions and closing loopholes. Gary Cohn also wades in, declaring that the plan will cut debt as a percentage of GDP. In other words, the economy would grow faster than the national debt. Q: You talked about repealing the 3.8% Obamacare rate that hits small businesses - is this the first attempt to start pulling Obamacare back? We are trying to get rid of that tax so we can get more capital back into the economy and stimulate business investment, says Cohn. Q: What do you say to critics who say this package is about helping corporations, not reforming the tax code? This package is about growing the economy and creating jobs, Cohn replies. Asked for more details about the plans, Cohn says the administration is still working with the House and the Senate to agree final details. The goal is to simplify the tax system, lower rates, and make the system fairer, he adds. Q: What are the income boundaries for the new 10%, 25% and 35% tax brackets? Cohn won\u2019t say - only that there is a \u2018broad brush\u2019 view of where they\u2019ll be. We\u2019ll be back to you with very firm details, he promises. Now Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks, confirming that the US corporation tax rate will fall to 15%. Small and medium-sized firms will benefit, he pledges, not just big business. Mnuchin also confirms a tax repatriation holiday for businesses who have got cash piles stacked overseas, but doesn\u2019t give details. Cohn predicts that the Trump administration will be attacked from both sides, but he wouldn\u2019t bet against the president getting this plan through. As rumoured, the plan cuts the number of tax brackets to three, from seven. We will repeal the Death Tax on American\u2019s estates, says Cohn -- something West Wing fans will be familiar with. Trump is creating a new zero-rate tax band, Cohn says, that means married couples won\u2019t pay tax on the first $24,000 they earn. Cohn outlines how complicated the US tax code has become - it now comes with 211 pages of instructions. Americans spend 7 billion hours complying with tax codes each year, he declares - and almost everyone needs some help filling the form in. Gary Cohn speaks first. This is a historic day, he says - a once in a generation opportunity. The president is going to lead the most significant tax reform legislation sine 1986, and one of the biggest tax cuts in history. Many of the key principles have already been agreed with Congress, Cohn continues, and the administration will work hard over the next few weeks to get a full agreement. Tax reform is \u2018long overdue\u2019, he continues - both for business and families, especially low and middle-income ones. The session is underway - press secretary Sean Spicer jokes that he didn\u2019t expect such a big audience for an announcement about the Antiquities Act (tee hee....) I think this live feed should let you watch Mnuchin and Cohn in action.... Some Republicans are already concerned that Trump\u2019s plan is all about tax cuts, and not really about reforms at all. CNN has the details: House Speaker Paul Ryan put a positive spin on things during his own news conference Wednesday, but things are far from great behind the scenes. The Trump administration has ruffled GOP feathers on Capitol Hill, by getting in the way of legislators efforts to fix the tax system. \u201cIt\u2019s not tax reform,\u201d said one senior GOP aide. \u201cNot even close.\u201d We\u2019re expecting to hear details of the tax reform plan very shortly.... While we wait to hear from Steven Mnuchin (and Gary Cohn) here\u2019s a video clip of him speaking earlier today: CNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers has heard that Trump\u2019s plan might eliminate some tax exemptions (which allow people to lower their overall bill) It was not a convincing display, but this week\u2019s market rally which began with Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the first round of the French election and was then fuelled by the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has continued for another day. Ahead of the confirmation of the US president\u2019s plans European markets ended higher, helped by a positive morning on Wall Street. There was still some caution in Europe, as investors awaited Thursday\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank, which will be carefully scrutinised for any hints that the bank might begin withdrawing its economic stimulus measures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 13.08 points or 0.18% at 7288.72 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% at 12,472.80 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.19% higher at 5287.88 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 20,836.51 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 10,763.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.3% to 706.40 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 56 points or 0.27% higher. Not everyone is upbeat about Trump\u2019s corporation tax reform. ActionAid head of policy Anna Thomas said: President Trump\u2019s plan to slash the corporate tax rate risks triggering a global race to the bottom, which could see companies paying minimal taxes around the world. Despite public outrage at corporate tax scandals involving the likes of Google and Amazon, big companies look set to benefit from historically low rates. The IMF has found that when countries try to undercut each other on tax, poorer countries suffer the most. They are particularly dependent on corporation tax and stand to lose the most as they come under pressure to offer ever-lower tax rates to big companies. Healthcare, schools and other key public services are left starved of resources as they are deprived of tax revenues, hitting women and girls hardest. There are reported details of further US tax reforms, in addition to the cut to corporation tax. Individual tax bands of 10%, 25% and 35% are being proposed, apparently: Here\u2019s a comparison of various countries\u2019 corporate tax rates: US markets have come to life ahead of the Trump tax announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 67 points and is just 100 points shy of its record high of 21,169 hit on 1 March this year. If the market likes what it hears from Trump\u2019s administration, that barrier could soon be breached. Meanwhile Nasdaq, which did hit a record high on Tuesday, has edged higher, with many of its technology constituents likely to benefit from the tax changes. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global markets have continued in a buoyant mood today, thanks to optimism about the impending tax reforms in the US. Despite a significant degree of political uncertainty still evident in Europe, there is a feeling that worst is over, with markets instead focusing on the Trump trade coming back into play. Unlike other more nuanced political and economic changes, a huge corporate tax cut would make a huge difference to the bottom line of US-based businesses. For investors, this impending shift in profitability is a huge attraction to invest in the US, and hence the outperformance of the American markets relative to Europe. Over in Greece, as long-stalled bailout negotiations finally resume, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been causing ripples warning that while parliament may legislate creditor-demanded reforms, the painful measures may never be implemented if the country isn\u2019t given debt relief. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: With the timing of a maestro, Greece\u2019s leftist leader used the first day of reactivated bailout talks to deliver a stern message: without promised debt relief the pension cuts and tax hikes Athens has now agreed to as part of a bigger package to unlock further emergency loans will never be enforced. In a live TV interview aired late Tuesday, Tsipras said it was Greece\u2019s right as \u201cas sovereign government\u201d to reverse the measures (the equivalent of 2 % of GDP and due to be enacted as of 1.1.2019) if lenders didn\u2019t also honour pledges to offer medium-term debt relief that would allow the economy to breathe. \u201cThey will not be implemented if we do not have a solution to the debt,\u201d he told ANT 1 TV. While the controversial cuts worth \u20ac3.6bn would be approved by parliament in the coming weeks, Tsipras insisted it was within Greece\u2019s sovereign right \u201cto take back something that had been voted if the agreement wasn\u2019t upheld.\u201d Predicting that the progress review would be completed in time for the next eurogroup on May 22 \u2013 averting the prospect of crisis being replayed when Greece is called to meet \u20ac7.5bn of maturing debt in July \u2013 Tsipras argued that the review was no ordinary report card but part of a much broader agreement that would allow the country to finally recover from eight years of crisis. While Athens had been forced to make concessions, it had also won the ability to enforce \u201ccounter measures\u201d to offset losses when Greece hit budget targets and secured valuable labour rights that the IMF had wanted to abolish. \u201cWe must not see this review as a review that only concerns the bailout programme. It is the most critical review. Why? Because we have a comprehensive agreement,\u201d he said in the interview. Unlike the American Petroleum Institute figures out on Tuesday, the latest official figures on crude stocks show a surprise fall in inventories. The API said stocks rose last week by 897,000 barrels but figures from the Energy Information Administration show a weekly fall of 3.64m barrels to 528.7m. This is higher than the forecast fall of 1.7m barrels. Gasoline stocks however rose by 3.37m barrels compared to expectations of a 1m barrel fall. Brent crude, which had earlier fallen as low as $51.38 a barrel is now up 0.19% at $52.2. The API report is an industry one while the EIA is a government publication. Here is more on the two reports, which are often aligned but sometimes contradict each other. Investors are awaiting more details on the Trump tax plan, hence the muted reaction in the markets so far, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Financial Analyst Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s confirmation that Donald Trump is seeking to cut corporation tax to just 15% did little for the markets this afternoon. Mnuchin echoed the President in an interview on CNBC, promising the \u2018biggest tax cut\u2019 and \u2018largest tax reform in US history\u2019. Yet this hyperbole was treated as just that by the Dow Jones, which nudged a mere 0.1% higher after the bell. Even the dollar was nonplussed, maintaining 0.3% and 0.5% rises against the euro and Japanese yen respectively while sitting flat against sterling. The fact investors failed to react to the Treasury Sec\u2019s headline tax cut announcement suggests that they are looking for more detail, especially the red flags that may cause any proposed bill to go the same way as Trump\u2019s healthcare reforms. There is also every chance that the bulk of the tax plan\u2019s market-boosting juice was used up yesterday, leaving little room for extra growth following the Mnuchin/Cohn press conference later this evening. Elsewhere oil prices are slipping back ahead of new official US crude inventory data from the Energy Information Administration. Earlier in the week industry figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stockpiles rose by 897,000 barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 1.7m fall. The report indicated the difficulty producers are having in reducing supplies despite cuts in output, which have been offset by growing production from US shale companies. Brent crude is currently down nearly 1% at $51.60 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dipped 0.8% to $49.16. Confirmation of at least one part of Donald Trump\u2019s US tax proposals - corporation tax cut to 15% - has done little for US markets, but at least they have opened higher rather than lower as originally expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 7 points while the S&amp;P 500 is virtually flat and Nasdaq Composite is 1.45 points better. Here\u2019s our first take on the proposed US tax reforms, with a corporation tax to 15% now confirmed by Treasury secretary Mnuchin: Here\u2019s more details of the Mnuchin interview, and some early reaction: Nice work by The Hill and CNBC there, getting early confirmation from the Treasury secretary about Trump\u2019s tax reform plans. Here\u2019s CNBC\u2019s early take: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that the tax plan the Trump administration will outline Wednesday afternoon will call for a 15% corporate rate. At an event hosted by The Hill, Mnuchin \u2014 who declined to go into many specifics about the proposal \u2014 contended it would be \u201cthe biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country.\u201d Mnuchin and White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn are expected to go into more detail about the plan at a briefing later in the day. When Trump floated a 15 % corporate tax rate as a candidate, most analyses of the proposal estimated that it would balloon the deficit. It is unclear what the proposal would do to raise revenue to offset those major cuts, and Mnuchin declined to say how specifically the administration would pay for the 15% rate. Asked about the US debt ceiling, Steven Mnuchin says an agreement must be done in the fall (that\u2019s the autumn, UK readers) to create headroom for more borrowing. He doesn\u2019t want to get into the details of any potential deal, though. On the US economy, Mnuchin says he\u2019s confident that 3% per-year growth can be achieved [up from just 1.6% last year]. Newsflash: America\u2019s treasury secretary has just confirmed that Donald Trump wants to cut business taxes to just 15%. Speaking to CNBC ahead of today\u2019s official announcement, Steven Mnuchin says: I can confirm that the business tax rate will be 15%. This will deliver on Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to cut corporation tax, and stimulate growth and job creation, the Treasury secretary explains. The aim is to cut the taxes paid by small businesses, Mnuchin continues, rather than create a loophope for the rich. Mnuchin adds that the Trump administration want to simplify the US tax code. We have a fundamental agreement with Congress about tax reforms, Mnuchin explains, but the details need to be worked out. The interview is being streamed live here. Today\u2019s Wall Street open will be more whimper than bang, with the Dow expected to open broadly unchanged. The pound has taken the opportunity to claw back a little ground against the euro today, up 0.2% to \u20ac1.178. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Sterling has bounced off a two-week low of \u20ac1.1718 versus the euro to trade around half a cent higher at \u20ac1.1771 by noon, although euro strength is generally still being underpinned by ongoing expectations that Emmanuel Macron will defeat Eurosceptic candidate Marine Le Pen in the second round of the French presidential elections on 7 May. Social networking site Twitter has defied its critics and posted better than expected financial result. Shares in Twitter are soaring in pre-market trading after it reported earnings of 11 cents per share (on a non-GAAP basis) up from the 1 cent per share which Wall Street expected. Twitter also signed up an extra 9 million users in the last quarter, and now has 6% more users than a year ago. But despite that, Twitter\u2019s revenues declined in the quarter to $548 million, down 8% on a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to report accelerating growth in daily active usage for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 14% year-over-year,\u201d said Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO, warns that Twitter continues to face \u201crevenue headwinds\u201d, but believes it will return to positive revenue growth in the long term. Traders are optimistic; Twitter shares have surged by 11% in the New York grey market. Former UK prime minister David Cameron apparently told friends recently it was time to \u201cput some hay in the barn\u201d, after swapping Downing Street for the speaking circuit. By that measure, Barack Obama may need a second barn - after agreeing to give a speech to Cantor Fitzgerald for $400,000.... Newsflash: One of the employment agencies at the centre of the workplace problems at Sports Direct is preparing for insolvency. My colleague Simon Goodley explains: Transline, the temporary employment agency that became embroiled in the Sports Direct scandal, has submitted court documents preparing the company for insolvency. The Guardian understands that the business has filed a \u201cnotice of intention of appointing administrators\u201d at a court in Leeds, and has sounded out the accountancy firm Deloitte as a potential administrator. The \u201cnotice of intention to appointment\u201d is a device to give notice to secured creditors that there is a chance or prospect of an administration process. It also creates a moratorium around the business from action by creditors for 10 working days. Transline hit the headlines last year, over its \u2018six strikes\u2019 policy that penalised workers for trivial actions like \u2018excessive talking\u2019 or taking time off to nurse an ill child. It has also been facing backpay claims from Sports Direct staff who received less than the minimum wage, due to security checks. Here\u2019s the full story: It\u2019s been one of those mornings... It\u2019s been a good morning for Yorkshire-based chemicals company Croda. Shares in the FTSE-listed firm hit a record high this morning, up 4.8%, after it reported a blistering 19% jump in revenues in the last quarter. It confirms that UK companies are benefitting from the fall in sterling since the EU referendum (Croda\u2019s sales were only up 5% in \u2018constant currency\u2019 terms). Croda aren\u2019t exactly a household name, but its chemicals go into a swathe of products - from beauty products and Omega 3 fish oil to paints and adhesives. Is some UK economic data being leaked early, and is someone profiting from it? The Wall Street Journal has examined how the pound performs around major data releases, and found that it typically starts to move before the news hits the wires. That\u2019s fuelling concerns that some people may be illicitly profiting from embargoed information. The WSJ\u2019s Mike Bird explains: During the hour before unexpectedly strong or weak U.K. data is made public, the pound moved 0.065% versus the dollar on average in the same direction it subsequently did after those numbers came out, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University. It showed that the average change in the pound\u2019s value one hour before and after such economic data announcements is 0.127%, meaning around half the shift associated with the statistics came ahead of their official release This is significant because UK data is shared with a wide number of government insiders (from ministers to press officers) before it is released. This creates the potential for a leak -- unlike in Sweden, say, where no-one outside the statistics office gets a sniff before the official release. And the Swedish krona is much less likely to pre-empt a data announcement: More here: Are U.K. Traders Getting an Early Glimpse at Government Data? Currency Markets Suggest Yes Kathleen Brooks of City Index has released a very useful note outlining the Trump tax proposals, and the likely political hurdles. Here\u2019s a flavour: Will Congress back Trump this time? In theory this tax plan looks like it should extend the rally for US stocks. If taxes are slashed then some large US firms may re-base themselves back in the US to take advantage of the 15% rate, which might encourage them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities such as share buy-backs, larger dividends etc. However, stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill. The pesky debt ceiling remains crucial problem for Congress The problem for the Republican -controlled Congress is the debt ceiling, which was breached back in March but has been massaged by some accounting measures until the end of this month. Congress is trying to pass a budget that will fund the Federal Government from 28th April, however, an unfunded tax cut from the Trump administration could add to the pressure on the debt ceiling going forward. Thus, Republicans have to balance their desire to reduce the Budget deficit, with their desire to boost the economy with a large cut to the corporate tax rate. If they do the latter, as many expect, then this could be a green light for US stock markets. Infrastructure plan, what infrastructure plan? This makes Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan, which has been suspiciously absent from the coverage of the tax blueprint, very unlikely to go ahead. The Trump team is likely to focus on the fact a tax cut can pay for itself and create jobs, but can it do that at the same pace of a large government-spending programme? On balance, we expect markets to outperform in the coming days if key members of Congress throw their weight behind Trump\u2019s tax proposals. But, if there are any signs that this won\u2019t get through the US legislature, then we could see big declines for US stocks. European stock markets will probably have closed before we hear details of Trump\u2019s tax proposals. According to The Hill, an announcement is expected at 1.30pm Washington time, or 6.30pm BST. They also predict that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn will present the plans; Trump is busy holding a session on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. After two solid days, European stock markets are taking a little breather. The UK, French and German indices have all dipped in early trading: Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms plans are the number one issue in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. He sounds a little sceptical about the whole thing, though: Currently, one major aspect of his plan which everyone is talking about is the corporate rate tax cut to 15% from its current rate of 35%. He can certainly cut that to 15% but that would only be good enough to produce a mammoth headline on the newswire. But, the question which you need to ask is how long it will take for that tax rate to become effective if it becomes effective at all. The market may go higher on the back of these flashy headlines but it will not take long before reality catches up with it. Last weekend\u2019s French elections continues to reassure traders, says Chris Weston of IG: It\u2019s a good time to hold equity and credit and it seems a dark cloud in the form of the French elections has swiftly departed from the investment landscape, combining effectively with headlines on Trump tax reform and in turn providing fresh impetus to chase returns. The prospect of sweeping tax reforms in America has helped to drive Asian stock markets higher today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed 1% higher, and the other main indices are also gaining ground. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a buoyant mood in the markets today, keeping indices at their highest ever levels. Yesterday the MSCI World Index hit a record high, helped by optimism over European politics and hopes of chunky tax cuts in America. That sent Wall Street racing last night, with the Nasdaq hitting 6,000 points for the first time ever. And traders expect to hold onto these gains today: Three factors are working together to keep shares up, and thwart those who think the rally has gone two far. 1) The Europe effect. Investors seem pretty convinced that Emmanuel Macron will defeat Marine Le Pen on May 7th, and become France\u2019s next president. Cautious voices point out that Macron faces a serious struggle to get his reform agenda moving - especially if his En Marche! party don\u2019t make big wins in June\u2019s elections. 2) Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. The US president is expected to outline fiscal plans today, including slashing corporation tax from 35% to just 15%. That\u2019s alarmed some experts, with one estimating that it could cost $2 trillion in revenue. But lower taxes = higher profits = higher share prices. There\u2019s also optimism that a budget deal can be reached to prevent a government shutdown, with Trump apparently giving ground over his Mexican Wall plan: 3) Decent corporate earnings. Yesterday, fast food chain McDonald\u2019s and equipment maker Caterpillar both beat forecasts, bolstering hopes that the global economy is on firmer footings. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US equity markets continues their sharp jump higher in anticipation of the Trump administration\u2019s tax reform announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq trading above 6,000 for the very first time, while both the S&amp;P500 and Dow Jones indices move closer to their respective all-time highs. Strong Q1 earnings performances from Caterpillar, McDonald\u2019s and DuPont led the Dow over 200 points higher, while the Materials sector led the S&amp;P to within 20 points of a fresh high. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, agrees that \u201cConfidence has returned\u201d, adding: Markets seem a lot more relaxed. Globally, we\u2019re seeing a lot of risk-on.\u201d There\u2019s not much in the economic diary today. On the corporate front, the London Stock Exchange, Jupiter Fund Management, Metro Bank, chemicals firm Croda and German carmaker Daimler are reporting results this morning. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer is to launch an online grocery shopping service this autumn as it looks to cash in on the success of its food halls. The retailer confirmed that a team of executives was currently drawing up a battle plan ahead of trials this autumn, allowing M&amp;S customers to order food online and have it delivered to their home. While Britons may have fallen out of love with the M&amp;S clothing ranges in recent years they have been heading in droves to its food aisles as they opt to pick up food for an evening meal rather than do a big weekly shop. Until now selling food online has not made business sense for M&amp;S as its customers do not typically spend enough on groceries on each visit to make the service profitable. But the retailer has concluded it can no longer ignore what is the fastest growing section of the UK\u2019s \u00a3180bn grocery market as new delivery services, such as AmazonFresh, which allows shoppers to order groceries at lunchtime and get the delivery in time for dinner, revolutionise the way Britain buys food. Senior executives were informed of the plan at a meeting at Wembley, north-west London, on Wednesday. \u201cWe continue to review food online carefully,\u201d said Steve Rowe, chief executive of M&amp;S. \u201cIt has not cost us anything over the last five years by not being online with food. Our customers haven\u2019t moved yet, but they will and we need to ensure that we are ready with the right response. There are unanswered questions over what this means for M&amp;S and we have a team looking at this now with a view to undertaking a soft trial in the autumn.\u201d M&amp;S already sells a limited selection of party food and alcohol on its website but this would be the first time its wider grocery offer would be made available online. The high-street store is different from other food retailers as it stocks just 7,000 products compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops. It also focuses on exclusive own-brand products with only a limited number of household brands available in its stores. It is not clear how the retailer would overcome these hurdles if it were to offer customers a full grocery outlet. \u201cThe economics of food online are not straightforward and it is not something that we are going to rush into until we have substantial customer insight and a better understanding of what is right for M&amp;S and right for our customers,\u201d Rowe added. Tony Shiret, an independent retail analyst, said Rowe was finally \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d. Shiret added: \u201cIf they don\u2019t do food online they stand to lose market share to people who do. It\u2019s become a basic expectation from customers.\u201d However, the analyst said the retailer would face a big challenge trying to make the service profitable. \u201cIt is going to be tricky for them because their shopping baskets are small as people use their stores to buy bits and pieces.\u201d Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at the M&amp;S Croydon store in south London, and took over as chief executive last April, is seeking to revive the declining profits of the 132-year-old retailer. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm which under his predecessor, Marc Bolland, relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers. Rowe is also keen to exploit the success of its food arm. Last year Rowe announced plans to shut 30 UK stores and convert 45 more into food-only shops as part of a business overhaul that would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to clothing and face the challenge posed by online shopping. M&amp;S confirmed the location of six of the affected stores, which included four large \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homeware and food.

                "bodyText":"Phew! Economists and investors are catching their breath after a busy day dominated by growth figures from the eurozone, the UK and America. There\u2019s some disappointment that Britain, the United States and France all grew slower than expected in January to March. But there\u2019s no panic. American GDP is expected to rebound this quarter, while the UK seems to be settling into a period of slower growth due to the pick-up in inflation, and some Brexit uncertainty. Here\u2019s our news story about the US GDP: And here\u2019s our UK GDP story: Thanks for reading and commenting. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Here\u2019s today\u2019s Nasdaq record high: Larry Fink, the head of fund management firm BlackRock, has said it\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d that America grew slower than France in the last quarter. Fink is speaking at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago, where he expressed concern about the US slowdown. [Reminder, we learned today that French GDP rose by 0.3%, or 1.2% on the US-style \u2018annualised basis\u2019]. The US stock market isn\u2019t too concerned by the growth figures. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped in early trading, but the technology-focused Nasdaq hit a new record high. That\u2019s due to Amazon and Alphabet (Google), which both posted strong results after the closing bell on Thursday night. The weather is copping some blame for the slowdown in US growth. Unusually mild conditions meant Americans spent less money heating their homes and offices during the winter, which equates to lower economic activity. Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains: \u201cWarm weather meant consumers weren\u2019t spending as much on electricity and natural gas and home heating. Government spending can also be affected by seasonal factors, and defense spending is especially volatile.\u201d Here\u2019s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, explaining how weak consumption dragged the American economy back down in the last three months: The slowdown in the first quarter this year was principally due to a near-stagnation in consumption, which increased by only 0.3% annualised. Household spending was held down by a drop back in motor vehicle sales from a near-record high at the end of last year and the unseasonably warm winter weather, which depressed utilities spending. But consumer confidence is unusually high and real personal disposable income increased at a 4% annualised pace in the first quarter. Consumption growth will rebound in the second quarter. Another former Democratic official argues that we shouldn\u2019t panic about the US growth figures. Jason Furman, who chaired president Obama\u2019s council of economic advisors, points out that growth will likely rebound in the April-June quarter. It may be tempting to contrast Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d with the news that US economic growth has hit a three year low on his watch. This certainly isn\u2019t the start that Trump had in mind during the campaign, when he boasted that America could grow by more than 4% per year if he were in charge. But I don\u2019t think you can really blame the new president for the slowdown in Q1 (especially if you\u2019re also criticising him for not getting much done in his first 100 days). The consequences of Trump\u2019s presidency will only emerge over many months and years. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: We haven\u2019t yet had the expected fiscal stimulus from Trump, the effects of which may not be seen until the end of this year or the start of 2018. While investors might be disappointed with the reading, it has been a steady start to the year with inflation looking benign, a resilient jobs market and positive PMI data, all likely to boost returns for investors.\u201d Macro-economic strategist George Pearkes concurs: Jared Bernstein, a former advisor to VP Joe Biden, points out that America\u2019s economy has posted solid enough growth over the last year: Some context: As you can see, America\u2019s economy also grew modestly in Q1 2016, and actually shrank in Q1 2014. The first three months of 2015 weren\u2019t amazing either. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the US growth figures: The U.S. economy turned in the weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter as consumers sharply slowed their spending. The result repeats a pattern that has characterized the recovery: lackluster beginnings to the year. The Commerce Department says the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter. The slowdown primarily reflected slower consumer spending, which grew by just 0.3 percent. That was the poorest showing in more than seven years. Analysts blame in part the unusually warm winter, which meant less spending on utility bills. Economists believe the slowdown will be temporary. They forecast GDP growth will rebound to 3% or better in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u2019s economy has slowed sharply, posting its weakest growth in three years. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of just 0.7% in the first three months of 2017. That\u2019s equal to a quarterly rate of less than 0.2%, and means that the first growth figures of the Trump administration are a disappointment. This is a sharp slowdown compared to the final quarter of 2016, when the US economy grew at an annualised pace of 2.1%. As in the UK, consumer spending was partly to blame, with car sales rather weak. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s snap take: Three down, one to go.... After disappointing GDP figures from the UK and France, but stronger growth in Spain, we\u2019re now turning to America to see how its economy fared in the first quarter of this year..... Time for a quick recap of this morning\u2019s UK growth report. Economists are warning that the Brexit slowdown has begun, after Britain\u2019s economic growth has more than halved to its lowest rate since the EU referendum. UK GDP grew by just 0.3% in January to March, down from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s a weaker performance than the City expected. The service sector suffered the brunt of the slowdown, as rising prices hurt the retail, hotels and restaurant sector. The data show that the drop in the pound since last summer is now hurting the domestic economy. But manufacturing grew by 0.5%, suggesting sterling\u2019s depreciation has also boosted UK factories. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said that the UK economy remains resilient. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and TUC head Frances O\u2019Grady, have both warned that Britain faces a new cost of living squeeze. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says the consumer-driven slowdown has begun, as incomes are hit by slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation. One quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers\u2019 incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices; we still expect CPI inflation to exceed 3% in the second half of this year. The British Chambers of Commerce fears that the UK is entering a period of sluggish growth, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. With growth unlikely to pick up, Barclays predict UK interest rates will remain on hold until at least the end of 2018. The pound has not been rattled by the slowdown in UK growth. Instead, sterling hit a new seven-month high of $1.2957 after the GDP figures were released. The pound is now on track for its best month since the Brexit vote last June: As mentioned earlier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has become the latest bank to revise its pound forecasts higher. BAML currency analyst Kamal Sharma told clients that The announcement of an 8th June general election was a game-changing event for sterling. Sterling will face Brexit challenges but its day of reckoning has been pushed further into the future.\u201d BAML now expect the pound to bottom out at $1.25 in the current quarter and finish the year at $1.27, compared with their respective forecasts of $1.15 and $1.19 previously. The chancellor has now tweeted about the GDP figures: This chart, from CBI economist Alpesh Paleja, shows why the UK growth rate almost halved in the last quarter. As you can see, the retail and hospitality sector (in green) had been a key driver of growth in October-December, but shrank in January-March. The looming shadow of Brexit means the UK economy is unlikely to accelerate over the next couple of years, warns Morgan Stanley economist Melanie Baker. She writes: We expect this slower quarterly pace of growth to persist in 2017, reflecting our assumption that higher inflation will dampen real consumer spending growth and an assumption of subdued business investment as Brexit approaches As this chart shows, Morgan Stanley predict growth could inch up to 0.4% in April to June, but then dipping back to around 0.3%: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the news that growth slowed to 0.3% the last quarter: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures reveal the threat to living standards under the Tories. \u201cGrowth for the first three months of 2017 was only half of what was expected. It comes on the back of new forecasts last week from leading independent forecasters showing growth and earnings expectations slashed and inflation revised up.\u201d \u201cThere is no hiding from the truth. The Tories\u2019 economic plan has undermined the UK economy and is a threat to working people\u2019s living standards. \u201cThis General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Tory Party which only looks after the privileged few.\u201d There\u2019s not been much other reaction from the campaign trail; The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn thinks he knows why.... TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears that the alarm bells are ringing in the UK economy, now that the consumer slowdown is underway. \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures do not bode well for the future. \u201cConsumer spending has been propping up the UK economy. But with pay packets squeezed, families have less money to spend on the high street. \u201cThe next government cannot rely on household spending alone to drive growth, especially when another living standards crisis is on the horizon. \u201cPoliticians have long promised to rebalance the economy. They need to spell out at this election how they will deliver, starting with an industrial strategy that creates good jobs where they\u2019re needed most.\u201d But writing in The Times, Ed Conway suggests the Conservatives will play down economic issues in this election: The slowdown in Britain\u2019s economy will prevent the Bank of England raising interest rates until at least 2019. That\u2019s according to analysts at Barclays, who have issued a good note on the GDP figures. They argue: In our view, given rising inflationary pressures and the increasing likelihood of negative real wage growth in the coming months, household consumption will continue to ease over the course of 2017. All in all, we believe this strengthens our view that the Bank of England MPC will leave its monetary policy stance unchanged over our forecast horizon (until end-2018). Barclays also predict that the UK economy will keep slowing this year, as \u201chouseholds are forced to tighten their belts\u201d. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg says we shouldn\u2019t panic about the slowdown in the UK economy, even though growth halved in the last quarter: While the deceleration looks a little scary, the UK\u2019s trend rate is around 0.4%. The expansion is entering its eighth year and the labour market is at full employment. Against this backdrop, growth with some volatility around its trend rate during the middle of the cycle is more than satisfactory. Via Berenberg Bank, here\u2019s a neat chart showing UK growth by sector over the last decade: Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes Britain is entering a \u201csustained period of more sluggish growth\u201d. June\u2019s snap general election won\u2019t help the situation, he warns: Inflation is expected to continue to rise, increasing the squeeze on consumer spending power and firm\u2019s profit margins, pushing growth lower. The BCC\u2019s own Quarterly Economic Survey confirms that inflation is a key risk to the UK\u2019s growth prospects, with businesses under increasing pressure to raise prices. Uncertainty over the impact of Brexit and the distraction of a General Election are also likely to weigh on economic activity over the near term. Chancellor Philip Hammond has just been interviewed about the GDP figures by Sky News, outside the Treasury. Hammond argues that the UK economy is in good shape, despite the slowdown in the last quarter. \u201cEmployment at record highs and it\u2019s set to go higher still\u201d, says Hammond, adding that \u201cThe British economy is resilient\u201d. Q: But isn\u2019t the slowdown in growth due to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans? These negotiations will be \u201ctough and complex\u201d, Hammond replies. That\u2019s why we need strong and stable leadership and a clear mandate, to get the best possible deal, he concludes. The slowdown in Britain\u2019s service sector is worrying, because services firms make up around 80% of the economy. Dutch bank ING says households are being squeezed, and fears that Brexit uncertainty will compound the problem: Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen\u2019s take on today\u2019s GDP figures: Britain\u2019s economy slowed more than expected in the opening months of this year, with GDP growth slipping to 0.3% from 0.7% the previous quarter as the post-referendum rise in living costs took its toll on British households. The news adds to signs that the resilience seen for the UK economy in the wake of the Brexit vote is now waning and will come as a blow to Theresa May\u2019s government as it banks on a solid victory in the snap election on 8 June. Economists had expected growth to slow more modestly to 0.4% in the first quarter, according to a poll by Reuters. The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. Statisticians said the biggest drag was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back.... Click here for the full story: Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank sums up the slowdown: To put the pace of growth into context, this is like driving away for the bank holiday weekend, hitting traffic and slowing from 70mph to 30mph\u2026 and it is starting to rain... Clarke also believes that Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is responsible: This weakness is likely to be blamed on Brexit. That is probably fair, albeit in an indirect sense. The fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment. That hasn\u2019t happened. What did happen is the pound dived, pushing inflation sharply higher and that is causing consumer spending and hence overall growth to slow. The good news is that the surge in inflation is probably temporary and the squeeze on growth should pass. However, it is probably going to take another year before growth on back on an upwards trajectory. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says that weak pay growth and the rising cost of living is hurting the UK economy. \u201cAfter a GDP reading which defied expectation at the end of last year, all eyes were on the Q1 data to see whether the Brexit effect would have affected UK economic performance at the start of 2017. Rising inflation and slow wage growth have dampened consumer demand and reduced retail spending, which were helping drive growth last year after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. On the other hand though, the increased attractiveness of sterling in the wake of the referendum has boosted manufacturing and international exports, making headway in rebalancing the UK economy. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, fears growth will remain modest this year. \u201cToday\u2019s print of 0.3% represents a sharp fall from the giddy pace of growth we witnessed a last quarter. Rising inflation seems to be having a negative impact on the parts of the economy exposed to the consumer. Looking ahead, we expect that pressure on real household incomes will keep growth subdued. Mark Sismey-Durrant, chief executive officer at Hampshire Trust Bank, blames economic uncertainty for the slowdown: \u201cToday\u2019s decline in GDP demonstrates the short term uncertainty being felt among both businesses and consumers. Businesses like certainty and with the impact of the snap General Election and the evolving EU negotiations, perhaps some economic impact is inevitable. However, we believe that the outlook offers room for optimism, based on the resilience the economy has demonstrated since the EU Referendum. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway agrees that consumers are cutting back: ITV\u2019s Noreena Hertz reckons Theresa May won\u2019t be happy: Here are the key points from today\u2019s report into the UK economy: UK gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have increased by 0.3% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2017, the slowest rate of growth since Quarter 1 2016. Slower growth in Quarter 1 2017 was mainly due to services, which grew by 0.3% compared with growth of 0.8% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016. In Quarter 1 2017 there were falls in several important consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation; this was due in part to prices increasing more than spending. Production, construction and agriculture grew by 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively in Quarter 1 2017. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.1% during Quarter 1 2017. Today\u2019s GDP repost shows that Britain\u2019s economy is suffering the impact of higher inflation. Retailers, hotels and restaurants all suffered falling growth, after being forced to hike prices due to higher input costs (because sterling fell sharply after the EU referendum). The ONS says: Retail trade and accommodation services were the main contributors to the negative growth in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector. These industries were impacted by increases in prices. Britain\u2019s dominant service sector has suffered a significant slowdown in the last quarter. Services output expanded by just 0.3% in January-March, down from 0.8% in October-December. Industrial production grew by 0.3%, including a 0.5% rise in manufacturing output, construction expanded by 0.2% and agriculture grew by 0.2%. Breaking! Britain\u2019s economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of this year. UK GDP expanded by just 0.3% in January to March, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u2019s down from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016, and the slowest reading since the first three months of last year. More to follow.... A former top advisor to ex-chancellor George Osborne tweets: Tension is building in the City, with just four minutes to go until the UK growth figures are released. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says a surprise reading can\u2019t be ruled out.... After surprising everyone with 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016, the UK is expected to have seen a sharp drop-off in Q1 2017, analysts estimating that the country\u2019s economy expanded by just 0.4% across the first 3 months of the year. The GDP readings for the last few quarters, however, have tended to beat the Brexit-inspired gloom, so there is room for a shock this morning. Zing! Sterling has just hit its highest level against the US dollar since last September. The pound has jumped by 0.3% this morning to $1.2939, a seven-month high. It\u2019s also a little higher against the euro, at \u20ac1.1881. The rally comes as Bank of America tears up its gloomy forecasts for the pound. It now predicts that sterling will average $1.25 this quarter, having previously expected it to slump to $1.15. Gross domestic product is the economics world\u2019s favoured way of estimating growth and output. But it\u2019s not a perfect measure. GDP tries to pin down how well, or badly, a country is performing by estimating how much was produced, spent, and earned across its economy. It show the output across services, industry, construction and agriculture, household and government spending, business investment, and net trade. But it doesn\u2019t show whether the economic growth is being shared fairly, whether it is reducing inequality or creating it, whether economic activity is environmentally harmful, or Robert F. Kennedy gave the definitive explanation of GDP\u2019s flaws almost half a century ago, in a famous speech: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans. It\u2019s worth remembering that the UK\u2019s economy has actually held up pretty well since the EU referendum. GDP rose by 0.5% in July-September last year, accelerating to 0.7% in October-December, dashing forecasts that a Brexit vote would quickly trigger a recession. On a longer-term basis, Britain\u2019s economy has already posted 16 quarter of growth in a row. Unless today\u2019s report is a real shocker, that should become 17 quarters..... Breaking! Spain has shown Britain how it\u2019s done, by reporting strong growth figures for the last three months. Spanish GDP expanded by a punchy 0.8% in Q1, ahead of expectations, and extending its recent recovery. On an annual basis, Spain grew by 3.0%. Today\u2019s UK growth figures, due at 9.30am, are significant for several reasons. First, they\u2019re the most important economic data to be released before the general election on June 8th. So a strong GDP report would bolster the Conservative Party. But... Economists are expecting that growth slowed to its lowest rate in 12 months -- to around 0.4% to 0.5%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. So if the GDP report is disappointing, opposition parties should be able to land some blows on the government. Secondly, there\u2019s Brexit. These figures will cover the three months before Theresa May triggered Article 50. Crucially, they also cover the period when the PM gave her Lancaster House speech, committing to leave the single market. Will that have dented business confidence? And has rising inflation, due to the slump in sterling last year, started to hurt consumers? Thirdly, there\u2019s the impact on the markets. The pound has quietly been recovering in recent weeks, back up to $1.29 against the US dollar from just $1.21 in mid-March. If GDP misses forecasts, then the pound may get tonked. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have predicted that growth fell to 0.4%, setting the UK up for a year of slower growth. Even with the expectation of activity recovering in March, the broader narrative remains that we look for GDP growth to slow in 2017. Here\u2019s a good chart from the FT, showing how France\u2019s growth has fallen back: There\u2019s a flurry of banking news this morning too. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority-owned by the UK taxpayer, has posted its first quarterly profit since 2015. It made \u00a3259m in the three months to March, beating forecasts. Barclays has announced plans to hire 2,000 extra staff over the next few years, as part of a new push into technology. Can Fintech help to replace City jobs lost due to Brexit? And not to be outdone, the government has cut its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to just 0.89% - more than eight years after taxpayers bailing it out. We\u2019ve just learned that the slowdown in Britain\u2019s housing market is gathering pace -- another sign that the economy may be losing momentum. Nationwide has reported that prices FELL in April for the second month running (on a seasonally adjusted basis). And on an annual basis, prices only rose by 2.6% - the slowest rate of increase since June 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says it may be due to rising inflation, which is driving down real incomes. Also, prices may simply have risen too high, Gardner adds: \u201cThere may also be more fundamental reasons for the slowdown. House price growth has been outstripping earnings growth for a sustained period of time, steadily eroding affordability on a number of metrics. For example, the typical house price is currently 6.1 times average earnings, well above the long run average of 4.3 times earnings, and close to the all-time high of 6.4 times recorded in 2007. France\u2019s economy was dragged back by disappointing trade figures (because exports fell while imports rose). This breakdown of the GDP figures shows how net trade (commerce exterieur) was negative for growth. INSEE explains: Foreign trade weighs on growth Exports decreased in the first quarter of 2017 (-0.7% after + 1.4%), particularly in transport equipment. At the same time, imports accelerated (+ 1.5% after + 0.8%). In particular, purchases of refined petroleum products are rebounding and those of other industrial products are growing more vigorously. Overall, foreign trade weighed on growth, at -0.7 point, after a contribution of +0.2 point the previous quarter. Bert Colijn, senior colleague at ING Bank, says the French growth figures are a disappointment: Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet agrees, but is encouraged that French businesses are investing more in new equipment and buildings. Breaking: France\u2019s economy grew slower than expected in the first three months of this year. French GDP expanded by just 0.3%, missing the 0.4% which economists had predicted. It\u2019s not all bad news, though - INSEE, the stats body, has revised growth in the last quarter of 2016 up to 0.5%, from 0.4%. French consumers dragged growth back; household spending slowed to just 0.1%. Business investment jumped, though, to +0.9% from 0.6% -- an encouraging sign. But...exports fell sharply (-0.7% from + 1.4%) while imports accelerated (+ 1.5% from +0.8%). Good morning. We\u2019re about to get a deluge of economic data that will show how some of the world\u2019s largest economies have performed in 2017. Growth figures from Britain, America, France and Spain are all being released over the next seven hours. And for different reasons, they should all be fascinating. Britain\u2019s GDP report will be pored over for signs that Brexit is hurting the economy. Economists expect growth to have slowed in January-March to around 0.4% to 0.5%, down from 0.7% in October-December 2016. France\u2019s figures will highlight the scale of the challenge facing either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen. Spain\u2019s data will show whether the eurozone\u2019s battered periphery is still recovering.... And America\u2019s growth figures are the first school report since Donald Trump became US president. And the bad news is that economists predict a slowdown, as consumers cut back.

Hummus is made on the Hanger Lane site, in a sectioned-off production area in the equivalent of the savoury dip nerve centre. The problem began after a batch of the product, made with imported chick peas, was found to have an uncharacteristic metallic tang. It had already been despatched in tubs, prompting Bakkavor to write to all its supermarket clients to warn of a problem with the manufacturing process.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury\u2019s both cleared some lines from their shelves after what Sainsbury\u2019s described as \u201ctaste issues\u201d. Bakkavor admitted there was a strange taste, but stressed there was no food safety issue. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeking confirmation that this withdrawal was done on quality rather than safety grounds, and the information we\u2019ve received so far shows there is no indication of a food safety concern. The FSA hadn\u2019t been notified about this withdrawal, but food businesses only need to make us aware of withdrawals if they are for food safety reasons.\u201d</p> <p>It has not been made clear what caused the metallic taste but in foods and beer it can be caused by chemical reactions affecting lipids (fats and oils). This would usually be the result of a combination of two types of reaction \u2013 hydrolysis and oxidisation \u2013 according to the book Advances in Meat, Poultry and Seafood Packaging, published by Woodhead Publishing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/26/dip-back-in-beat-the-hummus-crisis-with-this-quick-recipe\">Dip back in: beat the hummus crisis with this quick recipe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Scandinavian supermarket Sevan, which has also removed hummus from its shelves in recent weeks due to a mystery taste, put forward a different theory.

Stocks have since been replenished and supermarkets say it is business as usual on the hummus front. </p> <p>But the sudden shortage has led to scrutiny of the the low-key and inevitably secretive world of mass food production, which takes place daily in similar buildings across the UK. Supermarkets routinely use the same suppliers to make similar products, although recipes are kept secret and all equipment is deep-cleaned between each rival production run.</p> <p>Derbyshire-based Matthew Walker, for example, turns out 26m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/22/matured-christmas-puddings-aim-to-keep-traditional-dessert-at-top-of-the-tree\">Christmas puddings</a> a year for all the major supermarkets and brands \u2013 from German discounters such as Lidl and Aldi through to <a href=\"http://www.harrods.com/food-and-wine?icid=megamenu_FW\">Harrods </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose\">Waitrose.</a> Similarly Mr Kipling \u2013 part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/premierfoods\">Premier Foods</a> group \u2013 makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/09/inside-worlds-largest-mince-pie-factory-mr-kipling-christmas\">mince pies</a> and other cakes not only for its own-brand label but also for the UK\u2019s major supermarkets and retailers. </p> <p>Talk of a crisis emerged amid Britons\u2019 apparently insatiable appetite for hummus. A survey in 2013 marked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/aug/07/british-love-affair-with-hummus\">Britain as the hummus capital of Europe</a>, with 41% of people having pots in the fridge \u2013 almost twice as many as in any other country.</p> <p>A far-sighted Waitrose was the first British supermarket to stock hummus in the 1980s, with others following in the next decade.

Fast-expanding supermarket ranges now include everything from reduced fat pastes to new-style versions made with beetroot or edamame beans. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that hummus has become so popular in the UK, although in the Middle East it\u2019s not a dip eaten from a tub but a meal \u2013 and people often don\u2019t know how a really good one tastes,\u201d Ottolenghi told the Guardian. \u201cYou can now buy hummus at various levels and you can also make it yourself, which is what I recommend.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/26/nigel-slater-hazelnut-dukkah-and-roast-beetroot-garlic-hummus-recipes\">Nigel Slater\u2019s hazelnut dukkah and beetroot garlic hummus recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nick Saltmarsh, founder of <a href=\"https://hodmedods.co.uk\">Hodmedod</a>, which works closely with British farmers to produce homegrown grains and pulses, including fava beans, haricot beans and quinoa, said the situation \u201chighlights, very sadly, the obscurity of our food system in the UK \u2013 so many people don\u2019t know where our food comes from, never mind what\u2019s in it and how it\u2019s made\u201d.

The little-known Bakkavor \u2013 set up 30 years ago in Iceland by brothers \u00c1g\u00fast and L\u00fddur Gudmundsson \u2013 is the UK\u2019s leading provider of fresh prepared foods. Hummus is made on the Hanger Lane site, in a sectioned-off production area in the equivalent of the savoury dip nerve centre. The problem began after a batch of the product, made with imported chick peas, was found to have an uncharacteristic metallic tang. It had already been despatched in tubs, prompting Bakkavor to write to all its supermarket clients to warn of a problem with the manufacturing process. Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury\u2019s both cleared some lines from their shelves after what Sainsbury\u2019s described as \u201ctaste issues\u201d. Bakkavor admitted there was a strange taste, but stressed there was no food safety issue. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeking confirmation that this withdrawal was done on quality rather than safety grounds, and the information we\u2019ve received so far shows there is no indication of a food safety concern. The FSA hadn\u2019t been notified about this withdrawal, but food businesses only need to make us aware of withdrawals if they are for food safety reasons.\u201d It has not been made clear what caused the metallic taste but in foods and beer it can be caused by chemical reactions affecting lipids (fats and oils). This would usually be the result of a combination of two types of reaction \u2013 hydrolysis and oxidisation \u2013 according to the book Advances in Meat, Poultry and Seafood Packaging, published by Woodhead Publishing. But the Scandinavian supermarket Sevan, which has also removed hummus from its shelves in recent weeks due to a mystery taste, put forward a different theory. The chain told Food Quality News it believed the unusual flavour came from chickpeas imported from Canada. Whatever the reason for the metallic tang, the UK shortages have had a knock-on effect for other retailers, as disappointed shoppers flocked to buy up their stock. Stocks have since been replenished and supermarkets say it is business as usual on the hummus front. But the sudden shortage has led to scrutiny of the the low-key and inevitably secretive world of mass food production, which takes place daily in similar buildings across the UK. Supermarkets routinely use the same suppliers to make similar products, although recipes are kept secret and all equipment is deep-cleaned between each rival production run. Derbyshire-based Matthew Walker, for example, turns out 26m Christmas puddings a year for all the major supermarkets and brands \u2013 from German discounters such as Lidl and Aldi through to Harrods and Waitrose. Similarly Mr Kipling \u2013 part of the Premier Foods group \u2013 makes mince pies and other cakes not only for its own-brand label but also for the UK\u2019s major supermarkets and retailers. Talk of a crisis emerged amid Britons\u2019 apparently insatiable appetite for hummus. A survey in 2013 marked Britain as the hummus capital of Europe, with 41% of people having pots in the fridge \u2013 almost twice as many as in any other country. A far-sighted Waitrose was the first British supermarket to stock hummus in the 1980s, with others following in the next decade. Chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi, Claudia Roden and the Lebanese chef and author Anissa Helou have done much to popularise Middle Eastern foods in recent years, with shoppers now viewing hummus as a grocery staple. Fast-expanding supermarket ranges now include everything from reduced fat pastes to new-style versions made with beetroot or edamame beans. \u201cIt\u2019s good that hummus has become so popular in the UK, although in the Middle East it\u2019s not a dip eaten from a tub but a meal \u2013 and people often don\u2019t know how a really good one tastes,\u201d Ottolenghi told the Guardian. \u201cYou can now buy hummus at various levels and you can also make it yourself, which is what I recommend.\u201d Nick Saltmarsh, founder of Hodmedod, which works closely with British farmers to produce homegrown grains and pulses, including fava beans, haricot beans and quinoa, said the situation \u201chighlights, very sadly, the obscurity of our food system in the UK \u2013 so many people don\u2019t know where our food comes from, never mind what\u2019s in it and how it\u2019s made\u201d. Saltmarsh\u2019s Suffolk-based company is currently working with the condiment firm Charlie &amp; Ivy\u2019s to launch a new fava bean hummus (using UK rapeseed rather than olive oil) at a food festival at the end of May. His UK-grown products have the backing of top chefs such as Ottolenghi, Mark Hix and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. \u201cHummus is one of our most popular dips,\u201d says Joanna Black, hummus buyer at M&amp;S. \u201cAs the trend for eastern Mediterranean-style foods and eating has grown, so has the demand for hummus. It\u2019s no longer seen as an exotic food, but a more everyday item that customers are very familiar with.\u201d But if there is one lesson from the shortlived hummus furore, it is to diversify your supply chain. Pret a Manger \u2013 now enjoying massive sales of hummus as a result of its new vegetarian and vegan menus \u2013 uses a different supplier and was completely unaffected.
