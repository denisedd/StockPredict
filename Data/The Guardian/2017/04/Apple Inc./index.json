A Le Pen victory would be huge challenge for the ECB as it would be required to give massive support to the Euro and to French bonds and banks as they would come under severe market pressure.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mike Bird</strong> of the <strong>Wall Street Journal </strong>points out that the eurozone jobless rate is now below its average level, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/03/markets-manufacturing-recovery-uk-factories-eurozone-unemployment-business-live?page=with:block-58e212a7e4b0a411e9abb241#block-58e212a7e4b0a411e9abb241\">today\u2019s fall</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/848825587082899457\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At 9.5%, unemployment in the eurozone is now below its average level since the beginning of the currency union. <a href=\"https://t.co/r6OQukU3F1\">pic.twitter.com/r6OQukU3F1</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bird (@Birdyword) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/848825587082899457\">April 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> of <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong> reckons Europe\u2019s labour market is benefiting from \u201crecent solid Eurozone growth and healthy business confidence\u201d.</p> <p>However....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With still appreciable slack in labour markets in most Eurozone countries, wage growth looks most likely to pick up only gradually.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e221a2e4b007e8557f23ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-03T10:25:48.549Z\">11.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s a record-breaking day in India, where the stock market has closed at its highest ever level.</strong></p> <p>Traders were encouraged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/03/markets-manufacturing-recovery-uk-factories-eurozone-unemployment-business-live?page=with:block-58e1f421e4b01ea2330beb23#block-58e1f421e4b01ea2330beb23\">today\u2019s manufacturing data, which showing growth picking up</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCTV18Live/status/848840855649648640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A &#39;Record&#39; Day For Market, All Major Indices End At All-time Closing High <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNBCTV18Market?src=hash\">#CNBCTV18Market</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/upv03oGmps\">pic.twitter.com/upv03oGmps</a></p>&mdash; CNBC-TV18 (@CNBCTV18Live) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCTV18Live/status/848840855649648640\">April 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e21b70e4b01ea2330bebac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-03T09:53:57.338Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariannethyssen\">Marianne Thyssen</a>, the European Commissioner for Employment, tweets that European leaders need to keep pushing to bring unemployment down:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mariannethyssen/status/848828533304590336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Feb 2017: Lowest unemployment rate (8.0%) in EU since May 2009.

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s official, America\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed last month. The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) just released its own report, and like Markit\u2019s rival data it shows that the growth rate dipped. The ISM\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to 57.2 in March, down from 57.7 in February. That\u2019s still a decent-enough result, comfortably over the 50-point mark that divides rising and falling activity level, and a little higher than expected. Here are the key points, via Bloomberg: ISM\u2019s production gauge cooled to a four-month low of 57.6 from 62.9, which was the best reading since March 2011 Gauge of supplier deliveries rose to 55.9 in March, the highest since December 2014, from 54.8 Measure of order backlogs climbed to 57.5, the best reading in three years, from 57 Customer inventories gauge fell to 47, matching the second-lowest since July 2015, from 47.5 That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The first of two healthchecks on America\u2019s factory sector just arrived, and it\u2019s a little disappointing. Markit\u2019s monthly US manufacturing PMI has fallen by nearly one whole point, from 54.2 to 53.3. That\u2019s the lowest reading since September 2016, signalling that growth has hit a six-month low. US manufacturers reported that new orders and output growth had slowed, meaning they also hired fewer new staff than earlier this year. And again, there are signs that raw materials are getting more expensive... Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief business economist, is warning that the US economy may be weakening: \u201cThe post-election resurgence of the manufacturing sector seen late last year is showing signs of losing steam. Output growth slowed to a six-month low in March, optimism about the outlook has waned and hiring has slowed accordingly. \u201cWhile the survey data suggest that the goods producing sector enjoyed a relatively good first quarter on the whole, the loss of momentum seen in February and March bodes ill for the second quarter. Newsflash: Another UK company is facing a takeover offer from an overseas rival. This time it\u2019s WS Atkins, the engineering, design, planning, and architectural design firm based in Epsom, Surrey. It has received a takeover offer from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., a Montreal-based engineering services company. The approach values Atkins at \u00a320.80 per share, a 35% premium to Friday night\u2019s close. Atkins told the City that: The Board of Atkins has indicated to SNC-Lavalin that the Possible Offer would deliver value to Atkins shareholders at a level that the Board would be prepared to recommend, subject to reaching agreement on the other terms and conditions of the offer. Atkins and SNC-Lavalin are in discussions about the other terms and conditions of the Possible Offer which is conditional on, amongst other things, diligence and financing. Shares in Atkins have soared by almost 30% to \u00a319.95, suggesting that City expects the deal to sail through. It\u2019s been a rather subdued morning in the City, with sentiment dampened by the slowdown in UK factory output growth. The FTSE 100 never really got moving, and is currently up just 1 points (0.02%). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, says investors are edgy as they wait for the leaders of America and China to meet later this week. Market direction remains indecisive, given the huge number of economic and political issues at hand.... The FTSE has started the week in somewhat indecisive fashion, with initial gains promptly erased ahead of a big week for the markets. Fashion firm Burberry is outperforming the market, up 1% after signing a deal to license its fragrances and cosmetics brands to US beauty firm Coty. The pound has lost half a eurocent against the euro today to \u20ac1.173, as well as half a cent against the US dollar. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, explains why: \u201cAfter sustaining an upward trend last week, the pound has fallen as the release of UK manufacturing figures showed signs of a slowdown. For the first time in several days, the pound showed signs of weakness against the euro and the dollar on the back of disappointing manufacturing figures for March \u2013 in marked contrast to the robust figures seen in Eurozone. These weaker figures suggest that after months of good export levels, the inflationary effects of Brexit and the falling demand for consumer goods could be making it difficult to sustain the same levels of growth. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that UK firms are having to cope with sharply rising input costs - as raw materials become steadily pricier. That\u2019s partly due to the depreciation in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains that firms are now passing those costs on. The reduced buying power of the Pound has led to the 11th consecutive rise in input costs with consumers feeling the effects in the form of higher prices on the high street. There are also signs that supply chains are struggling, with companies reporting longer waits for their own orders to be delivered. Brocks comments: Supplier delivery times have also begun to lag, clogging up the supply chains of British manufacturing. With the rate of new order growth showing early signs of easing in March, manufacturers must act to ensure they are not locked into costly contracts. Now is not the time for manufacturers to rest on their laurels. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the French presidential elections will determine whether Europe\u2019s recent recovery continues: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic growth looks to be robust with factory output growth hitting the fastest rate since April 2011. Germany and Netherlands within the euro-core continued to show strong growth but Greece deteriorated further during March. The surprising element has been UK\u2019s manufacturing, which has indicated a slowdown despite boost of the weaker pound after Brexit. As we now enter the second quarter of the year, the key event in Europe will be the French presidential election. While Eurosceptic Marine le Pen is expected to win in the first round and lose in the second round run-off , it is worth remembering opinion polls have proved fallible in predicting the strength of populist sentiment in the case of Brexit and the Trump victory. A Le Pen victory would be huge challenge for the ECB as it would be required to give massive support to the Euro and to French bonds and banks as they would come under severe market pressure.\u201d Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal points out that the eurozone jobless rate is now below its average level, thanks to today\u2019s fall: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons Europe\u2019s labour market is benefiting from \u201crecent solid Eurozone growth and healthy business confidence\u201d. However.... With still appreciable slack in labour markets in most Eurozone countries, wage growth looks most likely to pick up only gradually. It\u2019s a record-breaking day in India, where the stock market has closed at its highest ever level. Traders were encouraged by today\u2019s manufacturing data, which showing growth picking up. Marianne Thyssen, the European Commissioner for Employment, tweets that European leaders need to keep pushing to bring unemployment down: We have further good news for the Eurozone this morning, on top of the strong factory data. Unemployment across the region has fallen to its lowest level in almost eight years, in another sign that its economic recovery continues. The eurozone jobless rate fell to 9.5% in February, statistics body Eurostat reports, down from 9.6% in January. That\u2019s the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. Unemployment in the wider European Union also fell in February, to 8.0% from 8.1%. Twenty six EU members reported lower unemployment than a year ago, but the jobless rate did rise in Denmark and Lithuania. However, the figures also highlights the sharp differences across Europe. The lowest jobless rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (3.4%), Germany (3.9%) and Malta (4.1%). But in Greece, the jobless rate remains over 23%, and in Spain it is 18.0% (They mean February 2017, of course) Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, isn\u2019t too concerned by the slowdown in UK factory growth last month. \u201cAlthough March saw an easing in output, manufacturing\u2019s solid start to the year continues with healthy order books and exporters continuing to capitalise on sterling\u2019s weakness. However, with inflation looming large, manufacturers should be increasingly conscious of the potential softening of UK domestic demand, which has been fuelling growth for some time.\u201d Apologies, we\u2019re having some technical problems with images this morning. It\u2019s being looked into; in the meantime, here\u2019s the UK manufacturing PMI (in case you can\u2019t see it in the 9.42pm post) The pound has been hit by the news that UK factory growth slowed last month. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, at $1.2498. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, suspects that UK factories will suffer from slowing consumer demand this year: \u201cToday\u2019s data certainly doesn\u2019t set off any alarm bells but it does signal that the consumer, one of the big props of UK growth in recent years, is already under the cosh and if there is any loss of momentum in the global economy, these strong manufacturing indicators could falter.\u201d Newsflash! Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed in March, dashing hopes that growth would pick up. The UK manufacturing PMI has fallen to 54.2, the lowest reading in four months, according to data firm Markit. That\u2019s down from 54.5 in February, and rather weaker than the 55.0 which some City forecasters had expected. [reminder: Any reading over 50 shows growth] Markit reports that output and new order growth both slowed last month, suggesting that the British economy may be cooling. Consumer goods producers suffered the sharpest slowdown, with growth little higher than in February. Firms also reported another rise in input costs, as inflationary pressures hit the sector again. More encouragingly, they did also keep hiring staff. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector seems to be slowing down: \u201cThe survey data suggest that the goods-producing sector made a solid contribution to GDP during the opening quarter of 2017. However, it\u2019s clear that the expansion will be less than the buoyant 1.3% rise seen in the fourth quarter of last year. \u201cWith growth losing further momentum in March, that weaker trend is likely to continue into the second quarter. The latest survey also clearly shows that high costs and weak wage growth are sapping the strength of consumers, with rates of expansion in output and new orders for these products slowing further. Markit has also warned that Greece\u2019s manufacturing downturn continued last month: Operating conditions in the Greek manufacturing sector deteriorated further during March. The downturn was driven by another sharp decrease in new orders, which in turn contributed to a further drop in output. As a result of lower production requirements, firms reduced their staffing numbers and input buying. Boom! Europe\u2019s economic recovery continued last month, with factory growth hitting its fastest rate since April 2011. Data firm Markit reports that growth rates for production and new orders accelerated to near six-year highs in March. Companies reported a surge of orders from domestic and export clients, leading to faster job creation. This drove the overall eurozone manufacturing PMI up to 56.2 in March, up from 55.4 in February, showing the fastest growth in 71 months. The pace of the recovery is now causing new problems, with some firms reporting that their suppliers are struggling to meet demand. Germany and the Netherlands led the way with particularly robust growth. But Greece missed out again, suffering another contraction. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurozone manufacturing is clearly enjoying a sweet spell as we move into spring, but it is also suffering growing pains in the form of supply delays and rising costs. \u201cAll key business activity gauges \u2013 output, new order inflows, exports, backlogs of work and employment \u2013 are close to six-year highs. \u201cHowever, the survey is also signalling the highest incidence of supplier delivery delays for nearly six years, underscoring how suppliers are struggling to meet surging demand. \u201cThese delays send a warning signal about rising inflationary pressures, as busy suppliers are often able to hike prices. Prices charged for goods leaving the factory gate are consequently rising at the fastest rate since mid-2011, despite March seeing a drop in the price of oil and a stronger euro against the US dollar, as supplier price hikes are passed on to customers. \u201cThe upturn is broad-based with one exception. Greece is suffering an increased rate of contraction of its manufacturing economy, with exports dropping sharply again in March.\u201d German factory growth has hit its highest level in almost six years, thanks to a rise in exports. Markit says: Output increased at the fastest rate in over three years, driven by the strongest gain in new orders in nearly six years. Moreover, new export orders grew at the strongest pace since May 2010. This led to the sharpest rise in employment in over five-and-a-half years. France\u2019s manufacturing sector also had a good March, today\u2019s data shows. New orders surged, sending the French factory PMI up to 53.3 from 52.3 in February. Good news from Italy! The country\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its fastest jump in activity since March 2011. Italian factory bosses reported a \u201csharp and accelerated growth\u201d last month, with production rates picking up, new orders rising, and higher exports too. Data firm Markit also found that job creation accelerated, saying A record rise in backlogs of work meanwhile contributed to a further pick-up in factory job creation, while goods producers also raised their input buying levels. Encouragingly, manufacturers also showed plenty of optimism towards growth prospects in the coming year too. The first eurozone manufacturing data has arrived..... and it shows that Spain\u2019s factory sector slowed last month. The Spanish manufacturing PMI fell to 53.9 in March, the lowest reading since October, down from 54.8 in February. That\u2019s still comfortably over the 50-point that separates expansion from contraction, though, and firms said they were still optimistic about future prospects. Sanish firms also reported that the cost of raw materials continued to climb. Markit, which compiles the report, says: The rate of input cost inflation quickened to the fastest in nearly six years during March, having accelerated for the seventh month running. Among the items reported as being up in price were cotton, paper, plastics, steel, fuel and other oil-related products. Wowzers. Shares in UK chip designer Imagination Technologies have plunged by over 60% this morning, after it shocked the City by revealing that Apple will no longer use its intellectual property in its new products. Apple are Imagination\u2019s largest customer, and provide around half its revenue by using its intellectual property in iPhones, iPads, and iPods under a licensing agreement. All that will change in two years, though, Imagination revealed this morning in a rather terse announcement. Imagination also hinted at legal battles ahead, claiming it will be \u201cextremely challenging\u201d for Apple to design new chip architecture without infringing its intellectual property rights..... Germany\u2019s stock market is heading to a fresh record high in early trading, as Frankfurt traders start the week in good form. The DAX is leading Europe\u2019s stock markets higher in early trading, and has jumped over its previous record close in 2015. There\u2019s a more muted feeling in London where the FTSE 100 is pretty flat. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: April hits the ground running this Monday, with the markets kicking off the second quarter with a glimpse at Q1\u2019s final manufacturing PMIs. Turkey\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its fastest growth in three years. Today\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index report shows that firms took on more staff last month, to handle a pick-up in new orders. We\u2019ve already seen some encouraging manufacturing reports from Asia today, including a strong pick-up in India and steady growth in Japan. Reuters has the details: Factories across much of Asia posted another month of solid growth in March, rounding off a strong quarter for the world\u2019s manufacturers, even as exporters fear a rise in U.S. protectionism could snuff out a global trade recovery. China again led the way, with an official manufacturing index expanding at the fastest pace in nearly five years, while factory surveys on Monday showed encouraging growth as well in Japan, India and much of emerging Asia. Higher commodities prices have helped boost the value of exports, along with a global thirst for electronic gadgets, but many countries are reporting stronger sales volumes as well, even as the new Trump administration starts to flex its muscles on trade. \u201cAsia\u2019s economic backdrop remains solid with most countries remaining above the key threshold level of expansion, though U.S. trade protectionism fears is the biggest uncertainty for now,\u201d said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers in Hong Kong. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means a new flurry of reports on the world\u2019s manufacturing sector. At 9.30am we find out how Britain\u2019s factories fared in March. Economists predict another month of solid activity, with the weak pound providing a cushion to Brexit uncertainty. The consensus is that the UK manufacturing PMI will rise to around 55.1, up from 54.6 in February. That would signal faster growth, and a pretty strong start to 2017. Before that, we get figures from across the eurozone. And again, economists expect some decent figures, which would indicate that Europe\u2019s recovery is continuing to pick up. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has rounded up the predictions: We get to see the latest numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany, all four of which have shown a steady improvement since the beginning of the year, and which are expected to come in at 54.6, 55.2, 53.4 and 58.3 respectively, helped in no small part by the weaker euro. Any reading over 50 points shows growth, so these reports could drive Germany\u2019s stock market to a new record high: Then at 10am, we get the latest eurozone unemployment figures. Economists reckon the jobless rate could fall to 9.5% in February, which would be its lowest since 2009! Investors will also be thinking about geopolitics, where the situation looks rather tense. Donald Trump will be entertaining Chinese leader Xi-Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago golf course in Florida later this week, and there could be fireworks if the president brings up issues like currency manipulation and globalisation. And then there\u2019s Brexit, where the UK government is now vigorously defending Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty. Four days after Article 50 was triggered, the first comparisons with the Falklands Islands have begun....",

                "bodyText":"Phew! Economists and investors are catching their breath after a busy day dominated by growth figures from the eurozone, the UK and America. There\u2019s some disappointment that Britain, the United States and France all grew slower than expected in January to March. But there\u2019s no panic. American GDP is expected to rebound this quarter, while the UK seems to be settling into a period of slower growth due to the pick-up in inflation, and some Brexit uncertainty. Here\u2019s our news story about the US GDP: And here\u2019s our UK GDP story: Thanks for reading and commenting. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Here\u2019s today\u2019s Nasdaq record high: Larry Fink, the head of fund management firm BlackRock, has said it\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d that America grew slower than France in the last quarter. Fink is speaking at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago, where he expressed concern about the US slowdown. [Reminder, we learned today that French GDP rose by 0.3%, or 1.2% on the US-style \u2018annualised basis\u2019]. The US stock market isn\u2019t too concerned by the growth figures. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped in early trading, but the technology-focused Nasdaq hit a new record high. That\u2019s due to Amazon and Alphabet (Google), which both posted strong results after the closing bell on Thursday night. The weather is copping some blame for the slowdown in US growth. Unusually mild conditions meant Americans spent less money heating their homes and offices during the winter, which equates to lower economic activity. Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains: \u201cWarm weather meant consumers weren\u2019t spending as much on electricity and natural gas and home heating. Government spending can also be affected by seasonal factors, and defense spending is especially volatile.\u201d Here\u2019s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, explaining how weak consumption dragged the American economy back down in the last three months: The slowdown in the first quarter this year was principally due to a near-stagnation in consumption, which increased by only 0.3% annualised. Household spending was held down by a drop back in motor vehicle sales from a near-record high at the end of last year and the unseasonably warm winter weather, which depressed utilities spending. But consumer confidence is unusually high and real personal disposable income increased at a 4% annualised pace in the first quarter. Consumption growth will rebound in the second quarter. Another former Democratic official argues that we shouldn\u2019t panic about the US growth figures. Jason Furman, who chaired president Obama\u2019s council of economic advisors, points out that growth will likely rebound in the April-June quarter. It may be tempting to contrast Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d with the news that US economic growth has hit a three year low on his watch. This certainly isn\u2019t the start that Trump had in mind during the campaign, when he boasted that America could grow by more than 4% per year if he were in charge. But I don\u2019t think you can really blame the new president for the slowdown in Q1 (especially if you\u2019re also criticising him for not getting much done in his first 100 days). The consequences of Trump\u2019s presidency will only emerge over many months and years. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: We haven\u2019t yet had the expected fiscal stimulus from Trump, the effects of which may not be seen until the end of this year or the start of 2018. While investors might be disappointed with the reading, it has been a steady start to the year with inflation looking benign, a resilient jobs market and positive PMI data, all likely to boost returns for investors.\u201d Macro-economic strategist George Pearkes concurs: Jared Bernstein, a former advisor to VP Joe Biden, points out that America\u2019s economy has posted solid enough growth over the last year: Some context: As you can see, America\u2019s economy also grew modestly in Q1 2016, and actually shrank in Q1 2014. The first three months of 2015 weren\u2019t amazing either. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the US growth figures: The U.S. economy turned in the weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter as consumers sharply slowed their spending. The result repeats a pattern that has characterized the recovery: lackluster beginnings to the year. The Commerce Department says the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter. The slowdown primarily reflected slower consumer spending, which grew by just 0.3 percent. That was the poorest showing in more than seven years. Analysts blame in part the unusually warm winter, which meant less spending on utility bills. Economists believe the slowdown will be temporary. They forecast GDP growth will rebound to 3% or better in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u2019s economy has slowed sharply, posting its weakest growth in three years. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of just 0.7% in the first three months of 2017. That\u2019s equal to a quarterly rate of less than 0.2%, and means that the first growth figures of the Trump administration are a disappointment. This is a sharp slowdown compared to the final quarter of 2016, when the US economy grew at an annualised pace of 2.1%. As in the UK, consumer spending was partly to blame, with car sales rather weak. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s snap take: Three down, one to go.... After disappointing GDP figures from the UK and France, but stronger growth in Spain, we\u2019re now turning to America to see how its economy fared in the first quarter of this year..... Time for a quick recap of this morning\u2019s UK growth report. Economists are warning that the Brexit slowdown has begun, after Britain\u2019s economic growth has more than halved to its lowest rate since the EU referendum. UK GDP grew by just 0.3% in January to March, down from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That\u2019s a weaker performance than the City expected. The service sector suffered the brunt of the slowdown, as rising prices hurt the retail, hotels and restaurant sector. The data show that the drop in the pound since last summer is now hurting the domestic economy. But manufacturing grew by 0.5%, suggesting sterling\u2019s depreciation has also boosted UK factories. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said that the UK economy remains resilient. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and TUC head Frances O\u2019Grady, have both warned that Britain faces a new cost of living squeeze. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says the consumer-driven slowdown has begun, as incomes are hit by slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation. One quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers\u2019 incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices; we still expect CPI inflation to exceed 3% in the second half of this year. The British Chambers of Commerce fears that the UK is entering a period of sluggish growth, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. With growth unlikely to pick up, Barclays predict UK interest rates will remain on hold until at least the end of 2018. The pound has not been rattled by the slowdown in UK growth. Instead, sterling hit a new seven-month high of $1.2957 after the GDP figures were released. The pound is now on track for its best month since the Brexit vote last June: As mentioned earlier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has become the latest bank to revise its pound forecasts higher. BAML currency analyst Kamal Sharma told clients that The announcement of an 8th June general election was a game-changing event for sterling. Sterling will face Brexit challenges but its day of reckoning has been pushed further into the future.\u201d BAML now expect the pound to bottom out at $1.25 in the current quarter and finish the year at $1.27, compared with their respective forecasts of $1.15 and $1.19 previously. The chancellor has now tweeted about the GDP figures: This chart, from CBI economist Alpesh Paleja, shows why the UK growth rate almost halved in the last quarter. As you can see, the retail and hospitality sector (in green) had been a key driver of growth in October-December, but shrank in January-March. The looming shadow of Brexit means the UK economy is unlikely to accelerate over the next couple of years, warns Morgan Stanley economist Melanie Baker. She writes: We expect this slower quarterly pace of growth to persist in 2017, reflecting our assumption that higher inflation will dampen real consumer spending growth and an assumption of subdued business investment as Brexit approaches As this chart shows, Morgan Stanley predict growth could inch up to 0.4% in April to June, but then dipping back to around 0.3%: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the news that growth slowed to 0.3% the last quarter: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures reveal the threat to living standards under the Tories. \u201cGrowth for the first three months of 2017 was only half of what was expected. It comes on the back of new forecasts last week from leading independent forecasters showing growth and earnings expectations slashed and inflation revised up.\u201d \u201cThere is no hiding from the truth. The Tories\u2019 economic plan has undermined the UK economy and is a threat to working people\u2019s living standards. \u201cThis General Election is a choice between a Labour Party who will stand up for the many and a Tory Party which only looks after the privileged few.\u201d There\u2019s not been much other reaction from the campaign trail; The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn thinks he knows why.... TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears that the alarm bells are ringing in the UK economy, now that the consumer slowdown is underway. \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures do not bode well for the future. \u201cConsumer spending has been propping up the UK economy. But with pay packets squeezed, families have less money to spend on the high street. \u201cThe next government cannot rely on household spending alone to drive growth, especially when another living standards crisis is on the horizon. \u201cPoliticians have long promised to rebalance the economy. They need to spell out at this election how they will deliver, starting with an industrial strategy that creates good jobs where they\u2019re needed most.\u201d But writing in The Times, Ed Conway suggests the Conservatives will play down economic issues in this election: The slowdown in Britain\u2019s economy will prevent the Bank of England raising interest rates until at least 2019. That\u2019s according to analysts at Barclays, who have issued a good note on the GDP figures. They argue: In our view, given rising inflationary pressures and the increasing likelihood of negative real wage growth in the coming months, household consumption will continue to ease over the course of 2017. All in all, we believe this strengthens our view that the Bank of England MPC will leave its monetary policy stance unchanged over our forecast horizon (until end-2018). Barclays also predict that the UK economy will keep slowing this year, as \u201chouseholds are forced to tighten their belts\u201d. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg says we shouldn\u2019t panic about the slowdown in the UK economy, even though growth halved in the last quarter: While the deceleration looks a little scary, the UK\u2019s trend rate is around 0.4%. The expansion is entering its eighth year and the labour market is at full employment. Against this backdrop, growth with some volatility around its trend rate during the middle of the cycle is more than satisfactory. Via Berenberg Bank, here\u2019s a neat chart showing UK growth by sector over the last decade: Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes Britain is entering a \u201csustained period of more sluggish growth\u201d. June\u2019s snap general election won\u2019t help the situation, he warns: Inflation is expected to continue to rise, increasing the squeeze on consumer spending power and firm\u2019s profit margins, pushing growth lower. The BCC\u2019s own Quarterly Economic Survey confirms that inflation is a key risk to the UK\u2019s growth prospects, with businesses under increasing pressure to raise prices. Uncertainty over the impact of Brexit and the distraction of a General Election are also likely to weigh on economic activity over the near term. Chancellor Philip Hammond has just been interviewed about the GDP figures by Sky News, outside the Treasury. Hammond argues that the UK economy is in good shape, despite the slowdown in the last quarter. \u201cEmployment at record highs and it\u2019s set to go higher still\u201d, says Hammond, adding that \u201cThe British economy is resilient\u201d. Q: But isn\u2019t the slowdown in growth due to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans? These negotiations will be \u201ctough and complex\u201d, Hammond replies. That\u2019s why we need strong and stable leadership and a clear mandate, to get the best possible deal, he concludes. The slowdown in Britain\u2019s service sector is worrying, because services firms make up around 80% of the economy. Dutch bank ING says households are being squeezed, and fears that Brexit uncertainty will compound the problem: Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen\u2019s take on today\u2019s GDP figures: Britain\u2019s economy slowed more than expected in the opening months of this year, with GDP growth slipping to 0.3% from 0.7% the previous quarter as the post-referendum rise in living costs took its toll on British households. The news adds to signs that the resilience seen for the UK economy in the wake of the Brexit vote is now waning and will come as a blow to Theresa May\u2019s government as it banks on a solid victory in the snap election on 8 June. Economists had expected growth to slow more modestly to 0.4% in the first quarter, according to a poll by Reuters. The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. Statisticians said the biggest drag was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back.... Click here for the full story: Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank sums up the slowdown: To put the pace of growth into context, this is like driving away for the bank holiday weekend, hitting traffic and slowing from 70mph to 30mph\u2026 and it is starting to rain... Clarke also believes that Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is responsible: This weakness is likely to be blamed on Brexit. That is probably fair, albeit in an indirect sense. The fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment. That hasn\u2019t happened. What did happen is the pound dived, pushing inflation sharply higher and that is causing consumer spending and hence overall growth to slow. The good news is that the surge in inflation is probably temporary and the squeeze on growth should pass. However, it is probably going to take another year before growth on back on an upwards trajectory. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says that weak pay growth and the rising cost of living is hurting the UK economy. \u201cAfter a GDP reading which defied expectation at the end of last year, all eyes were on the Q1 data to see whether the Brexit effect would have affected UK economic performance at the start of 2017. Rising inflation and slow wage growth have dampened consumer demand and reduced retail spending, which were helping drive growth last year after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. On the other hand though, the increased attractiveness of sterling in the wake of the referendum has boosted manufacturing and international exports, making headway in rebalancing the UK economy. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, fears growth will remain modest this year. \u201cToday\u2019s print of 0.3% represents a sharp fall from the giddy pace of growth we witnessed a last quarter. Rising inflation seems to be having a negative impact on the parts of the economy exposed to the consumer. Looking ahead, we expect that pressure on real household incomes will keep growth subdued. Mark Sismey-Durrant, chief executive officer at Hampshire Trust Bank, blames economic uncertainty for the slowdown: \u201cToday\u2019s decline in GDP demonstrates the short term uncertainty being felt among both businesses and consumers. Businesses like certainty and with the impact of the snap General Election and the evolving EU negotiations, perhaps some economic impact is inevitable. However, we believe that the outlook offers room for optimism, based on the resilience the economy has demonstrated since the EU Referendum. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway agrees that consumers are cutting back: ITV\u2019s Noreena Hertz reckons Theresa May won\u2019t be happy: Here are the key points from today\u2019s report into the UK economy: UK gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have increased by 0.3% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2017, the slowest rate of growth since Quarter 1 2016. Slower growth in Quarter 1 2017 was mainly due to services, which grew by 0.3% compared with growth of 0.8% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016. In Quarter 1 2017 there were falls in several important consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation; this was due in part to prices increasing more than spending. Production, construction and agriculture grew by 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively in Quarter 1 2017. GDP per head was estimated to have increased by 0.1% during Quarter 1 2017. Today\u2019s GDP repost shows that Britain\u2019s economy is suffering the impact of higher inflation. Retailers, hotels and restaurants all suffered falling growth, after being forced to hike prices due to higher input costs (because sterling fell sharply after the EU referendum). The ONS says: Retail trade and accommodation services were the main contributors to the negative growth in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector. These industries were impacted by increases in prices. Britain\u2019s dominant service sector has suffered a significant slowdown in the last quarter. Services output expanded by just 0.3% in January-March, down from 0.8% in October-December. Industrial production grew by 0.3%, including a 0.5% rise in manufacturing output, construction expanded by 0.2% and agriculture grew by 0.2%. Breaking! Britain\u2019s economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of this year. UK GDP expanded by just 0.3% in January to March, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u2019s down from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016, and the slowest reading since the first three months of last year. More to follow.... A former top advisor to ex-chancellor George Osborne tweets: Tension is building in the City, with just four minutes to go until the UK growth figures are released. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says a surprise reading can\u2019t be ruled out.... After surprising everyone with 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016, the UK is expected to have seen a sharp drop-off in Q1 2017, analysts estimating that the country\u2019s economy expanded by just 0.4% across the first 3 months of the year. The GDP readings for the last few quarters, however, have tended to beat the Brexit-inspired gloom, so there is room for a shock this morning. Zing! Sterling has just hit its highest level against the US dollar since last September. The pound has jumped by 0.3% this morning to $1.2939, a seven-month high. It\u2019s also a little higher against the euro, at \u20ac1.1881. The rally comes as Bank of America tears up its gloomy forecasts for the pound. It now predicts that sterling will average $1.25 this quarter, having previously expected it to slump to $1.15. Gross domestic product is the economics world\u2019s favoured way of estimating growth and output. But it\u2019s not a perfect measure. GDP tries to pin down how well, or badly, a country is performing by estimating how much was produced, spent, and earned across its economy. It show the output across services, industry, construction and agriculture, household and government spending, business investment, and net trade. But it doesn\u2019t show whether the economic growth is being shared fairly, whether it is reducing inequality or creating it, whether economic activity is environmentally harmful, or Robert F. Kennedy gave the definitive explanation of GDP\u2019s flaws almost half a century ago, in a famous speech: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans. It\u2019s worth remembering that the UK\u2019s economy has actually held up pretty well since the EU referendum. GDP rose by 0.5% in July-September last year, accelerating to 0.7% in October-December, dashing forecasts that a Brexit vote would quickly trigger a recession. On a longer-term basis, Britain\u2019s economy has already posted 16 quarter of growth in a row. Unless today\u2019s report is a real shocker, that should become 17 quarters..... Breaking! Spain has shown Britain how it\u2019s done, by reporting strong growth figures for the last three months. Spanish GDP expanded by a punchy 0.8% in Q1, ahead of expectations, and extending its recent recovery. On an annual basis, Spain grew by 3.0%. Today\u2019s UK growth figures, due at 9.30am, are significant for several reasons. First, they\u2019re the most important economic data to be released before the general election on June 8th. So a strong GDP report would bolster the Conservative Party. But... Economists are expecting that growth slowed to its lowest rate in 12 months -- to around 0.4% to 0.5%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter. So if the GDP report is disappointing, opposition parties should be able to land some blows on the government. Secondly, there\u2019s Brexit. These figures will cover the three months before Theresa May triggered Article 50. Crucially, they also cover the period when the PM gave her Lancaster House speech, committing to leave the single market. Will that have dented business confidence? And has rising inflation, due to the slump in sterling last year, started to hurt consumers? Thirdly, there\u2019s the impact on the markets. The pound has quietly been recovering in recent weeks, back up to $1.29 against the US dollar from just $1.21 in mid-March. If GDP misses forecasts, then the pound may get tonked. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have predicted that growth fell to 0.4%, setting the UK up for a year of slower growth. Even with the expectation of activity recovering in March, the broader narrative remains that we look for GDP growth to slow in 2017. Here\u2019s a good chart from the FT, showing how France\u2019s growth has fallen back: There\u2019s a flurry of banking news this morning too. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority-owned by the UK taxpayer, has posted its first quarterly profit since 2015. It made \u00a3259m in the three months to March, beating forecasts. Barclays has announced plans to hire 2,000 extra staff over the next few years, as part of a new push into technology. Can Fintech help to replace City jobs lost due to Brexit? And not to be outdone, the government has cut its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to just 0.89% - more than eight years after taxpayers bailing it out. We\u2019ve just learned that the slowdown in Britain\u2019s housing market is gathering pace -- another sign that the economy may be losing momentum. Nationwide has reported that prices FELL in April for the second month running (on a seasonally adjusted basis). And on an annual basis, prices only rose by 2.6% - the slowest rate of increase since June 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says it may be due to rising inflation, which is driving down real incomes. Also, prices may simply have risen too high, Gardner adds: \u201cThere may also be more fundamental reasons for the slowdown. House price growth has been outstripping earnings growth for a sustained period of time, steadily eroding affordability on a number of metrics. For example, the typical house price is currently 6.1 times average earnings, well above the long run average of 4.3 times earnings, and close to the all-time high of 6.4 times recorded in 2007. France\u2019s economy was dragged back by disappointing trade figures (because exports fell while imports rose). This breakdown of the GDP figures shows how net trade (commerce exterieur) was negative for growth. INSEE explains: Foreign trade weighs on growth Exports decreased in the first quarter of 2017 (-0.7% after + 1.4%), particularly in transport equipment. At the same time, imports accelerated (+ 1.5% after + 0.8%). In particular, purchases of refined petroleum products are rebounding and those of other industrial products are growing more vigorously. Overall, foreign trade weighed on growth, at -0.7 point, after a contribution of +0.2 point the previous quarter. Bert Colijn, senior colleague at ING Bank, says the French growth figures are a disappointment: Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet agrees, but is encouraged that French businesses are investing more in new equipment and buildings. Breaking: France\u2019s economy grew slower than expected in the first three months of this year. French GDP expanded by just 0.3%, missing the 0.4% which economists had predicted. It\u2019s not all bad news, though - INSEE, the stats body, has revised growth in the last quarter of 2016 up to 0.5%, from 0.4%. French consumers dragged growth back; household spending slowed to just 0.1%. Business investment jumped, though, to +0.9% from 0.6% -- an encouraging sign. But...exports fell sharply (-0.7% from + 1.4%) while imports accelerated (+ 1.5% from +0.8%). Good morning. We\u2019re about to get a deluge of economic data that will show how some of the world\u2019s largest economies have performed in 2017. Growth figures from Britain, America, France and Spain are all being released over the next seven hours. And for different reasons, they should all be fascinating. Britain\u2019s GDP report will be pored over for signs that Brexit is hurting the economy. Economists expect growth to have slowed in January-March to around 0.4% to 0.5%, down from 0.7% in October-December 2016. France\u2019s figures will highlight the scale of the challenge facing either Emmanuel Macron or Marine Le Pen. Spain\u2019s data will show whether the eurozone\u2019s battered periphery is still recovering.... And America\u2019s growth figures are the first school report since Donald Trump became US president. And the bad news is that economists predict a slowdown, as consumers cut back. Frugal U.S. consumers seen holding back first-quarter GDP Here\u2019s the timings: France: Just released Spain: 8am BST UK: 9.30am BST United States: 1.30pm BST It\u2019s also going to be a busy morning in the banking sector, with Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland reporting results...",

On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s current dependency on the iPhone is likely to be reinforced when it reports second-quarter results, hence its desire to expand its services businesses.

                "bodyText":"A vision of the near future: you\u2019re in your driverless Apple vehicle, heading for the new-look Apple Store whose Genius Groves provide space for business meetings, while watching Apple\u2019s exclusive Carpool Karaoke video series on your Apple TV. The present is a bit more prosaic. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s current dependency on the iPhone is likely to be reinforced when it reports second-quarter results, hence its desire to expand its services businesses. The company is expected to report only a slight year-on-year rise in revenues to about $52bn after a couple of weak quarters, not to mention the first annual decline in iPhone sales last year. And analysts believe Apple\u2019s guidance for the third quarter could be cautious, with JP Morgan forecasting sales of $44.2bn for the three months to June. The problem is that consumers could be keeping their cash in their pockets until the next iPhone arrives (it\u2019s expected in September). Although some reports suggest the new model could be on display at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, there have also been suggestions the September launch may be delayed because of supposed problems with a new edge-to-edge screen. But despite chief executive Tim Cook being unhappy at some of Donald Trump\u2019s actions, notably the recent travel ban, Apple is set to benefit from the president\u2019s tax policies. Trump plans to give incentives to companies who repatriate their large overseas cash holdings, although no details were given at last week\u2019s tax announcement. A \u00a32.6bn loss?
