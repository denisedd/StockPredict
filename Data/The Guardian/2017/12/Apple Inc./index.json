It\u2019s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u2019d win the trade, but you\u2019d probably lose the payout.</p> <p>If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity.</p> <p>Which is arguably where we are now.</p> </blockquote> <p>This chart shows how the plan would play out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"709b034ce2b976baf195b755ceeed3b9cabf9a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709b034ce2b976baf195b755ceeed3b9cabf9a34/0_0_591_393/500.png\" alt=\"The bitcoin price\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bitcoin price</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alphaville</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But.... such a plan could still go wrong.

                "bodyText":"Time to recap: It\u2019s been another riproaring day for bitcoin, as the cryprocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Starting the day at $13,600, bitcoin smashed through $14,000 for the first time ever in early European trading. By 9am in New York, it was surging through $15,000. In increasing frenzied trading, bitcoin then hit $19,000 on the coindesk exchange (although Reuters never clocked it above $15,995). It then subsided, as bitcoin exchanges admitted they were struggling to keep up with the huge trading volumes. At today\u2019s prices, the total value of every bitcoin in the world is roughly equal to the market capitalisation of credit card firm Visa. The surge came despite fresh warnings that bitcoin could be a bubble. Sir Howard Davies, chair of Royal Bank of Scotland, said top central banks should cite Dante\u2019s famous warning from the gates of hell - \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019. In the last 12 months, bitcoin has now gained around 2,000%. It\u2019s gone from $11,000 to over $15,000 this week alone, amid signs that retail investors are piling in. Bitcoin is due to enter the mainstream next week, when clearing houses begin offering futures trading. But, several US banks are reluctant to take part, according to the Wall Street Journal. Analysts are split over whether futures trading will bring some calm to bitcoin. It could push the price down, as investors will be able to bet on a crash. But if money keeps pouring in, the price could head higher.... But investors were also reminded of the dangers of cybercrime, as a bitcoin wallet firm revealed it had been hacked. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Wall Street has just closed for the day, with small gains on the main indices. The Dow gained 70 points, or 0.3% - a performance matched by the S&amp;P 500. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose by 0.5%, partly thanks to Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Mark Hamrick,Washington bureau chief for Bankrate.com, reports that some investors aren\u2019t happy about missing out on bitcoin: Two major US banks have decided not to offer bitcoin futures trading when it launches this weekend. That follows concerns (covered in this blog earlier today) that the systems aren\u2019t robust enough. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports: Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. are telling customers that they won\u2019t offer them access to the first bitcoin futures market when it goes live on Sunday, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. futures broker, will offer access but only for certain customers, a person familiar with the situation said. ABN Amro Group will be handling trades for \u201ca small selected group of professional clients,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Dutch bank said in an e-mail. Morgan Stanley and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA are still evaluating their approach to bitcoin futures, other people said Thursday. CNN\u2019s Seth Fiegerman joined the bitcoin party last week, when he invested $100 in the digital currency. He\u2019s now written a handy explainer - here\u2019s a flavour: Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack. Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product. There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone. With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer. My original $100 bitcoin purchase won\u2019t officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won\u2019t be able to sell at the earliest until Friday. If the price plummets before then, I\u2019m out of luck. However, Mrs Fiegerman isn\u2019t impressed (and this is after the price went up!) City investor Justin Urquhart Stewart reports that his cabbie is interested in bitcoin.... Borrowing money to buy into a rising asset... that\u2019s one of the classic signs of a bubble, associated with the dreaded Minsky Moment (when prices suddenly collapse as speculators can\u2019t service their loans) Right now, bitcoin is trading at $15,300, according to the \u2018spot price\u2019 on my Reuters terminal. That\u2019s a gain of 12% today, and up over 40% since the start of the week Earlier it jumped to the brink of $16,000 (Reuters\u2019 data shows) but was seen rather higher on some other exchanges. Some bitcoin exchanges are struggling to handle the interest today, it seems. Coinbase, the largest US bitcoin, blamed \u2018record high traffic\u2019 for technical problems: Bitcoin wallet provider Trezor had a similar story: This may not reassure critics who wonder how the bitcoin ecosystem will cope with the next price correction..... Ian Guider of Ireland\u2019s Sunday Business Post spies a bubble... Speaking of volatile trading, bitcoin prices on the coinbase exchange just rocketed towards $20,000. But it swiftly slumped back to less stratospheric levels. What wild times! The bitcoin price has been particularly volatile today, as it struck a series of new highs: It won\u2019t be easy to run a future market in such a volatile asset..... Economics professor Justin Wolfers has put his finger on the problem with bitcoin pricing - it\u2019s hard to bet against it today. The launch of bitcoin futures markets on Sunday night will be an important moment, says Neil Wilson of City firm ETX. But he doesn\u2019t agree that letting traders bet against bitcoin necessarily means its price will fall. Wilson explains: At least with regulated futures the market ought to behave more normally than it has done \u2013 notwithstanding some pretty major spasms in the market that are likely on Sunday night and Monday morning as the contracts launch - and this would be net bearish for Bitcoin overall as it will allow proper shorting and hedging strategies. At present the only way to short is to sell your bitcoin and exit the market, a bias that favours bulls. The ability to go short creates a new dynamic in the market and may result in a significant shock to prices. The problem is anyone shorting against this headwind of rapidly rising prices needs to be able to sweat out huge potential upside. As plenty before have noted, Bitcoin might keep rising longer than shorts can stay solvent.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on Bitcoin\u2019s rally, and the concerns building about it..... Bitcoin has been likened to Dante\u2019s Inferno by the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged above $15,000 on Thursday, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors. Davies, a former head of the UK\u2019s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. Bitcoin has increased in value by $3,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,300 at lunchtime on Thursday. \u201cPut up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. Davies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. \u201cCentral banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],\u201d he said.... More here: Analyst Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that bitcoin usage isn\u2019t keeping pace with its price: A majority of City investors think that bitcoin is an unsustainable bubble. That\u2019s according to a survey of institutional investors, conducted by Natixis Investment Managers, which found: Institutional investors may believe bubbles have formed in both the bond (42%) and stock (30%) markets, but concerns for these traditional assets pale in comparison to the 64% who say there\u2019s a bubble in Bitcoins. Over on FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska has a fascinating theory to explain bitcoin\u2019s rise. In short, it\u2019s that certain investors have piled into bitcoin, driving its price every higher, because they plan to \u2018short\u2019 it next week. Shorting becomes a serious option once the CME clearing house launches its derivatives contracts next week. So if you\u2019ve invested the time and money to stock up on bitcoin this year, you could make immense profits if you short the cryptocurrency next week. She explains: Without the certainty of a properly regulated marketplace defending the futures side of the equation, a payoff cannot be guaranteed. It\u2019s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u2019d win the trade, but you\u2019d probably lose the payout. If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity. Which is arguably where we are now. This chart shows how the plan would play out: But.... such a plan could still go wrong. For example: The futures launch is suspended unexpectedly, perhaps due to regulatory concerns or industry pushback? The anticipated futures demand never arrives because the margin costs of holding open long positions proves to be too great and/or liquidity is so shoddy nobody can trade effectively. The cash settled return on the futures leg, won\u2019t necessarily be matched by the price achieved on the physical liquidation. More here: The smartest bitcoin trade in town? Wowzers! Bitcoin has now surged to $16,000 on one exchange: That means it\u2019s gained more than $3,000 since yesterday morning. In any bubble, there\u2019s a moment when new investors are lured in by reports of hefty profits, helping to drive the price higher and higher. Is that where we are now with bitcoin? And how much higher will it go? Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA predict a correction is looming.... The cryptocurrency has undoubtedly come on leaps and bounds this year but it\u2019s difficult to see anything move as Bitcoin has and not fear a devastating bubble bursting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Bitcoin has been making headlines over the last week or so, during which time it\u2019s risen another $5,000, or 50%. If speculation is playing as big a role in the latest moves as some expect, then very interesting times may lie ahead. Although as is always the case, this could rise a lot more before the bubble bursts. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: So, where are all these people who have made fortunes out of bitcoin? The Daily Telegraph have found one - and he\u2019s still just a teenager. They say: Eddy Zillan was 16 when he began investing in bitcoin, just two years later, the youthful investor estimates he has \u201cmade close to a million\u201d from trading in various cryptocurrency. The perspicacious Ohio teenager was an early adopter of the bubble and bust digital currency, investing in 2015 when bitcoin\u2019s price was as low as $214 following a prolonged bear market. \u201cI started off with $1,000 to play around with out of my savings,\u201d he told The Telegraph. \u201cI then acquired another $5,000 through my bar mitzvah money (in 2012). \u201cI then invested another $6,000 through money I earned and saved from working summer jobs.\u201d... Here\u2019s a useful non-technical explanation of bitcoin: Anyone who bought bitcoin two weeks ago (when it was trading at $8,000) has almost doubled their money. They won\u2019t give you that at your local bank! But, of course, that\u2019s exactly why some experts fear that a speculative bubble is building. Bitcoin buyers aren\u2019t heeding Sir Howard Davies\u2019s warning. The cryptocurrency just hit a new alltime high, at $15,200, as American traders arrive at their desks. Just in: The US jobs market remained strong last week. Just 236,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit during the seven days to 2nd December. That\u2019s down from 238,000 the previous week, and the third weekly decline in a row. Yann Quelenn of Swissbank believes bitcoin will keep climbing this month, perhaps even hitting $20,000 -- before suffering an abrupt reversal. Quelenn writes: Sheer greed is driving the cryptocurrency higher, perhaps to $20,000 per coin by Christmas. This would put Bitcoin\u2019s market cap above $300bn, one third that of Apple! Bitcoin is unique in history, true, but a correction will likely be very tough. Two Chicago exchanges, the CBOE and the CME, will soon launch trading of cryptocurrency futures. This signals an impending stampede of institutional investors \u2013 many speculators, some hedgers. Just watch the fireworks fly. Sir Howard Davies\u2019s hint that bitcoin is a hellish investment for the unwary is somewhat ironic, given the track record of the bank he chairs. Royal Bank of Scotland has been controlled by the UK taxpayer for nearly a decade, having been bailed out after nearly collapsing after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has made a steady stream of losses ever since, and the British government is now planning to crystallise a \u00a326m loss when it sells its RBS shares over the next few years. Davies can\u2019t be blame for RBS\u2019s plight, as he only joined in 2015. But the legacy of the financial crisis is exactly why some people believe cryptocurrencies make a lots of sense. Workers at GE Power have just had a very nasty shock. The US company is axing 12,000 jobs across the globe in a cost-cutting drive. The move includes 1,100 workers at its UK operations, mainly in Stafford and Rugby. GE blamed falling demand for fossil fuel power plants, saying: \u201cTraditional power markets including gas and coal have softened\u201d. Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!, is more optimistic about bitcoin\u2019s future. Yang reckons digital currencies can be a force for good in the long term. The key it to treat bitcoin as an actual currency, not an asset whose price has been driven up by speculation. As Yang put it to CNBC: \u201cBitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet. Personally, I am a believer in how digital currency can play a role in our society\u2026 but for now, it seems like it\u2019s more driven by the hype of investing and getting a return rather than using it as a transaction currency. The FT points out that Bitcoin has hit $15,000 on some crypto-exchanges. Look at that spread of prices, though! No wonder the US banks have concerns about bitcoin derivatives contracts hitting the markets...... Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, has issued a dire warning against investing in bitcoin. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, as bitcoin headed towards $15,000, Davies warned that the digital currency looked like a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. He\u2019s concerned that bitcoin doesn\u2019t really fall under any one regulator\u2019s remit, meaning the adults in the room aren\u2019t warning of the risks. Davies says it\u2019s hard to see any \u2018rational reason\u2019 for bitcoin\u2019s recent surge: All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno - \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019. That\u2019s what\u2019s needed, and it need to done by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank at the same time. So why aren\u2019t the world\u2019s top central bankers acting? Davies suspects they\u2019re worried about being seen as luddites if they criticise digital currencies, adding: The market is telling us something about the need for new faster payments systems. [But] I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s bitcoin in the long run. But should bitcoin actually be outlawed, as economist Joseph Stiglitz argues? No, replies Davies - if you ban bitcoin, other variants will simply take its place. Here\u2019s our story about the problems at NiceHash: The pound\u2019s volatility has hit its highest level in almost six months, as Brexit headines shunt sterling around: The old mantra Caveat Emptor goes without saying where bitcoin is concerned. Not only is its value uncertain (\u2018higher than yesterday\u2019 won\u2019t be true forever), but you run the risk of losing your bitcoins to a cybercriminal. Overnight, Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoins. It\u2019s a blow to bitcoin miners who had contributed their computing power to mine bitcoins through NiceHash. Users reckon that NiceHash\u2019s bitcoin wallet had held around 4,736.42 bitcoins \u2014 equivalent to over $66m at current prices. Here\u2019s the official statement: More reaction to Bitcoin\u2019s latest spike: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says Bitcoin\u2019s rise looks unstoppable -- but the launch of those bitcoin futures could change things. Bitcoin bulls have driven the virtual currency beyond $14,500 for the first time. The bitcoin has jumped 20% over the last 24 hours with buyers of the virtual currency now eyeing up $20,000. Given the fact that both the CBOE and the CME exchanges will begin offering bitcoin futures this month, perhaps the prediction of $20,000 is not that far off? However, the start of futures trading also means the start of short trades on the bitcoin, which could increase volatility further. Now this is interesting. The Financial Times is reporting that some of the world\u2019s largest banks are resisting the imminent launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading will allow people to trade the digital currency without actually owning it. It\u2019s means to open bitcoin up to a wider range of investors. However, given bitcoin\u2019s volatility, some industry figures fear that the clearing houses that underpins the markets could suffer massive losses if the cryptocurrency were to crash. The FT says: The world\u2019s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market. However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday. In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures \u201cdid not allow for proper public transparency and input\u201d. Newsflash: UK house prices kept rising last month, according to the latest data from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices rose by 0.5% during November, leaving them 3.9% higher than a year ago. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, says the Bank of England\u2019s (well-flagged) interest rate hike last month hasn\u2019t spooked buyers: \u201cThe improved performance of the market in the latest quarter suggests the first interest rate rise in a decade may have ignited demand. \u201cOn this evidence, the November rate rise has brought prospective buyers out into the open rather than sent them underground. \u201cMany buyers may have come to the conclusion that it is better to move now while mortgage rates are still low than further down the line when they could be less competitive. Currency traders may need to don their tin hats in the coming days, as the Brexit negotiations intensify. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, predicts plenty of volatility: \u201cEurope is the only show in town right now, and ongoing speculation around a solution to the Irish border issue has further dampened enthusiasm for sterling. A deal must be done by close of play Friday if Brexit talks are to move onto trade after next week\u2019s summit. Reality is, deadlines will likely get extended, whisper from Brussels will raise and dash expectations, and we may or may not get anything at the end of it. Prepare for a volatile couple of days on the currency markets. Merger news: GVC, the gambling giant behind Foxy Bingo and PartyCasino, is in talks over a \u00a33.9bn takeover of Ladbrokes. Shares in both companies have jumped in early trading (Ladbrokes surged by over 25%). If successful, it would create one of the world\u2019s largest betting firms. Ladbrokes could welcome a takeover, given the mounting criticism over its fixed-odds betting terminals (savaged as being \u2018crack cocaine\u2019 of gambling). The final value of the deal will partly depend on the government\u2019s clampdown on FOBT, which could take a chunk out of Ladbrokes profits. Geopolitical issues are high on the market\u2019s agenda today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: Politics will again be to the fore as UK government attempts to find some compromise on the hypersensitive issue of the Irish border, while the fall-out from Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital threatens to escalate already enormous tensions across the Middle East, and quite obviously contradicts UN resolution 478. Last night\u2019s price surge was remarkable, even by bitcoin\u2019s recent standards: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as traders worry that Britain may not get a Brexit breakthrough before Christmas. Sterling dipped overnight to $1.337 against the US dollar, with no immediate sign of an end to the deadlock over the Irish border question. That\u2019s almost two cents lower than Monday, when optimism of a deal was rising. It\u2019s also a little weaker against the euro, at \u20ac1.133. Tensions mounted after Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said the UK must agree the text on a potential deal by Friday night. Otherwise, the two sides can\u2019t shift onto taking about that precious trade deal. Time is running short, as analysts at FxPro warn this morning.... If talks do not move on to the next stage of discussions in December then the terms of a transition period will likely be pushed back until the next European council summit of leaders in March, by which time many businesses in the UK will have had to make decisions over their location and investments in the country. So, the City is looking to Westminster for some serious progress between the UK government, the DUP (it\u2019s Northern Irish partners) and Dublin. But if each side sticks to its principles, this will be tough - so sterling could have a choppy ride. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to soar at an ever faster rate. The digital currency battered its way through the $14,000 mark overnight, having hit $12,000 yesterday. More consumers are jumping into bitcoin - presumably having heard stories of its rapid ascent. Institutional investors are also taking more interest, as they\u2019ll soon be able to buy and sell bitcoin derivative contracts. It will intensify the argument between those who think bitcoin is a monetary paradigm shift, and those who see a dangerous bubble. Par example: We\u2019ll also be watching out for new UK house price figures, updated eurozone growth stats and the weekly US unemployment report: The agenda 8.30am GMT: Halifax UK house price survey for November 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP statistics for Q3 2016 (second estimate) 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless claims 4pm GMT: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks at a press conference held by the Bank for International Settlement.",

The second is to make sure we don\u2019t have any cameras or recording devices because everything he is about to teach is \u201ccopyright myself and Robbie\u201d. </p> <p>Once that\u2019s out of the way, the acronyms come thick and fast.

A favourite, he says, are HMOs (houses in multiple occupancy). \u201cThat\u2019s buying a house and splitting it up into rooms and letting them individually.\u201d The ROI (return on investment), he says, can be \u201cinfinite\u201d.</p> <p>The trainer is also a fan of repossessed homes. But, he says, there are bigger profits to be made by finding people at risk of repossession. \u201cI target repossessions before the people are repossessed,\u201d he says. \u201cI take out ads in the local paper: \u2018Are you facing repossession? Call your local landlord, [the trainer].\u201d</p> <p>He promises to teach us how to run a tax-efficient business because he \u201chates the taxman \u2026 doesn\u2019t everyone\u201d. Other methods include \u201ccreative finance\u201d, which he promises means even potential investors with no assets and bad credit ratings can borrow money to start their property empire. </p> <p>He then suggests that those in the room with poor credit ratings could offer their friends, or even strangers in pubs, 20% interest to borrow \u00a3100,000 to pump into schemes. \u201cEven if they want 50% [interest], you can still do it and make money. You should be able to make money in any market \u2013 up, down, sideways,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do, I\u2019m not a financial adviser.\u201d</p> <p>Noticing some scepticism in the room, the trainer then demands \u201c100% energy, focus and commitment\u201d and emphasises his point with a demonstration that involves throwing a glass of water on the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the hotel will send me the bill,\u201d he says.</p> <p>About halfway through the promised two-hour free session, he reckons we have now learned enough to declare ourselves property investors. It\u2019s official. \u201cBy the power invested in me by the Hilton Euston, I now declare you all professional property investors,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But property investing is complicated, and he can\u2019t possibly tell us all the secrets used by Fowler and others in only two hours. To learn all the \u201cstrategies\u201d, we are encouraged to sign up for a three-day weekend course. It costs \u00a31,994, but included in that price is a \u201chome study toolkit\u201d worth \u00a3497 and a 20-minute \u201cstrategy planning call\u201d with a property adviser, apparently worth \u00a3250.</p> <p>Ali, one of the potential investors in the room, lets out a shocked \u201ccor blimey\u201d as the prices are flashed up on screen.</p> <p>The trainer replies: \u201cLook, you don\u2019t know me, but judge me on these people [Fowler, Black and Roberts]. Their name is their brand.\u201d And he says the BBC had to vet the course before Roberts could lend his name to it.</p> <p>Legacy Education Alliance has not been endorsed by the BBC, according to a BBC spokesman, who added that Roberts was freelance and not a member of BBC staff. </p> <p>Roberts\u2019 wife, Kirsty Withyman, who represents him, said: \u201cHe feels the courses offer a good insight into the world of becoming a property investor, and that those who go on them have a better chance of success as a result. His own marketing states that the contents of the courses are not endorsed by the BBC, but the BBC are obviously aware that Martin takes part in them.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler, Black and Backley did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>Legacy Education Alliance, which is based in Florida, said: \u201cIn relation to the accusation regarding property repossessions, this has been taken out of context. Strategies and techniques that are taught are compliant and legal and do not encourage or endorse exploitation of vulnerable individuals.</p> <p>\u201cMany thousands of students have been taught and mentored by Legacy Education Alliance Inc the world over, during the last 15 years. Many of these success stories opt to give back and help others through crewing, training and mentoring the next generation of professional property investors.\u201d</p> <p>At the Euston Hilton, there is a special offer for those who sign up today. The home study toolkit is free, the planning call is free, the course can be picked up for \u00a3997 and students can bring a friend \u2013 but only if they get their credit cards out now. The weekend course, according to online reviews, appears to be a precursor to other courses that can cost \u00a330,000.</p> <p>The lecturer wants us all to build our own property empire so we can give up our jobs and devote our time to what\u2019s really important in life. Because of property, he says, when his best friend was \u201cin the hospice dying\u201d he could be there at her bedside even when her husband had to go to work. \u201cLast week, Tuesday, she passed away. And it was property that allowed me to be there.\u201d </p> <p>Half a dozen people walk to back of the room with their credit cards out and sign up for the weekend course, and the speakers pump out the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 I Gotta Feeling. \u201cThat tonight\u2019s gonna be a good, good night,\u201d the lyrics go. \u201cI got my money, let\u2019s spend it up.\u201d </p>",

It\u2019s official. \u201cBy the power invested in me by the Hilton Euston, I now declare you all professional property investors,\u201d he says. But property investing is complicated, and he can\u2019t possibly tell us all the secrets used by Fowler and others in only two hours. To learn all the \u201cstrategies\u201d, we are encouraged to sign up for a three-day weekend course. It costs \u00a31,994, but included in that price is a \u201chome study toolkit\u201d worth \u00a3497 and a 20-minute \u201cstrategy planning call\u201d with a property adviser, apparently worth \u00a3250. Ali, one of the potential investors in the room, lets out a shocked \u201ccor blimey\u201d as the prices are flashed up on screen. The trainer replies: \u201cLook, you don\u2019t know me, but judge me on these people [Fowler, Black and Roberts]. Their name is their brand.\u201d And he says the BBC had to vet the course before Roberts could lend his name to it. Legacy Education Alliance has not been endorsed by the BBC, according to a BBC spokesman, who added that Roberts was freelance and not a member of BBC staff. Roberts\u2019 wife, Kirsty Withyman, who represents him, said: \u201cHe feels the courses offer a good insight into the world of becoming a property investor, and that those who go on them have a better chance of success as a result. His own marketing states that the contents of the courses are not endorsed by the BBC, but the BBC are obviously aware that Martin takes part in them.\u201d Fowler, Black and Backley did not respond to requests for comment. Legacy Education Alliance, which is based in Florida, said: \u201cIn relation to the accusation regarding property repossessions, this has been taken out of context. Strategies and techniques that are taught are compliant and legal and do not encourage or endorse exploitation of vulnerable individuals. \u201cMany thousands of students have been taught and mentored by Legacy Education Alliance Inc the world over, during the last 15 years. Many of these success stories opt to give back and help others through crewing, training and mentoring the next generation of professional property investors.\u201d At the Euston Hilton, there is a special offer for those who sign up today. The home study toolkit is free, the planning call is free, the course can be picked up for \u00a3997 and students can bring a friend \u2013 but only if they get their credit cards out now. The weekend course, according to online reviews, appears to be a precursor to other courses that can cost \u00a330,000. The lecturer wants us all to build our own property empire so we can give up our jobs and devote our time to what\u2019s really important in life. Because of property, he says, when his best friend was \u201cin the hospice dying\u201d he could be there at her bedside even when her husband had to go to work. \u201cLast week, Tuesday, she passed away. And it was property that allowed me to be there.\u201d Half a dozen people walk to back of the room with their credit cards out and sign up for the weekend course, and the speakers pump out the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 I Gotta Feeling. \u201cThat tonight\u2019s gonna be a good, good night,\u201d the lyrics go. \u201cI got my money, let\u2019s spend it up.\u201d",

Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December.</p> <p> Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation.

                "bodyText":"Right, time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s stock market has closed at a new peak tonight, on the first trading day since Christmas. The FTSE 100 hit a record closing high, propelled by mining companies as optimism for the world economy in 2018 boosted commodity prices. The smaller FTSE 250 also finished at its highest ever level, partly due to a takeover bid for office manager IWG (which closed 27% higher). The rally came as new data showed that the world\u2019s 500 richest people had collectively gained $1tn in 2017. But it was a volatile day for bitcoin. After surging 13% yesterday, the digital currency has fallen back this afternoon. It\u2019s currently down 4% at $15,094 - having been valued at almost $20,000 10 days ago. This latest fluctuation came after Israel\u2019s stock market regulator suggested it could ban cryptocurrency firms from listing on the Tel Aviv exchange. That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The jump in commodity prices today helped to push the FTSE 100 to its record high, thanks to the various mining giants that are included in the index. Sky News explains: The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: \u201cThe rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth.\u201d Of course, the FTSE 100\u2019s run of record highs is less impressive once you remember the tumble in sterling 18 months ago. The pound is still worth around 10% less than before the EU referendum; that made UK companies more affordable to overseas investors, and pumped up the value of their foreign earnings. Peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft tweets: The smaller, more domestically focused FTSE 250 has also hit a new record high tonight: Newsflash: the FTSE 100 index has closed at a new all time high of 7,620 points. Mining companies and supermarkets helped the index rise on the first trading day since Christmas. Newsflash: US consumer confidence has fallen back from its recent highs. The Conference Board\u2019s measure of consumer confidence, just released, dropped to 122.1 in December, down from November\u2019s 129.5 - which was the highest in 17 years. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, says: \u201cThe decline in confidence was fueled by a somewhat less optimistic outlook for business and job prospects in the coming months,\u201d The wheels are coming off Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. The crypocurrency is now down over 4% at $15,080, which means it has shed over $1,000 since this morning\u2019s early bounce. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened very slightly higher as traders return to work after the Christmas break. The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 16 points, or 0.07%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also managed minuscule gains. While mining companies drove the FTSE 100 to today\u2019s record high, engineering firm Rolls-Royce, building materials group Ferguson, broadcaster Sky and holiday firm TUI all held it back: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high, following the lead set by its little brother, the FTSE 250. The index of the biggest companies listed in London has risen by 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7615 - nudging over the previous intraday record set last Friday. The jump in commodity prices today, such as copper, has pushed mining stocks up (silver miner Fresnillo is the top performer, up almost 3%), with other natural resource companies also up. This means the FTSE 100 has gained around 6.6% this year, lagging behind other indexes such as the US Dow Jones (+25%), Germany\u2019s DAX (+13%) or the Hong Kong Hang Seng (+34%). Maybe it was the prospect of Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys as the highlight of TV on Christmas Day - but according to official HMRC figures, a total of 2,590 people said \u2018bah humbug\u2019 to the festivities and decided to spend the day filling in and submitting their tax return instead. Even as millions of kids across the globe were transfixed by Santa trackers on their computers, in the last hour of Christmas Eve, 92 grown-ups were instead glued to the HMRC\u2019s homepage and sent in their tax returns between 23.00 and midnight. On Boxing Day, a further 7,655 returns arrived at HMRC. HMRC issued the figures as it began its annual plea to the 11m people in Britain who must complete a self-assessment form by January 31. This year it has a new advertising campaign, featuring ducks, of course. The strapline is \u201cDon\u2019t let your tax returns peck away at you\u201d. It\u2019s quackers. Via City AM, here\u2019s a list of the billionaires who gained the most wealth in 2017. The full table is online here. Meanwhile a new poll in Greece has revealed that most citizens are not buying the leftist-led government\u2019s cheery vision of a \u2018clean exit\u2019 from international supervision when the country\u2019s latest bailout programme officially ends next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens In theory, Greeks should be going into the new year on an optimistic note. After seven years of gruelling austerity \u2013 the price of three economic adjustment programmes that have kept the debt stricken country afloat \u2013 Athens\u2019 latest bailout officially expires in August 2018. But the excoriating terms attached to financial rescue won\u2019t end there, with the result that most Greeks are not buying government assertions of post-bailout bliss come the summer. Instead, a poll conducted on behalf of the Real News newspaper by MRB Hellas found that 66.3% of respondents are convinced that international monitoring of Greek finances will continue in some form. A mere 17% accept the official version: that Greece will make a \u2018clean exit,\u2019 weaning itself off borrowed funds by returning to international capital markets. Under that scenario \u2013 one vividly expanded by prime minister Alexis Tsipras \u2013 Athens will have completed a compliance review in time for the country to build up a cash buffer that would enable it to return to markets and begin debt relief talks by the summer. However, only one in four Greeks expect a market return. Three out of five don\u2019t think Greece would be able to tap markets to cover debt payments, according to the survey. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, has hit a new alltime high. The FTSE 250 has gained 59 points to 20,540 this morning, putting it ahead of the previous record high set on 22 December. Offices group International Workplace Group (IWG) is leading the rally; its shares have jumped by almost 30% today after receiving a takeover offer from Canada\u2019s Onex and Brookfield Asset Management. The FTSE 100 is also close to a record high today, up 13 points at 7606. Other European markets are lagging, though, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 0.3% and Spain\u2019s IBEX down 0.2%. Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explains: Miners are leading the FTSE\u2019s charge higher after Copper traded a fresh three and half year high on Christmas Day, however a significant contribution from Oilers, the index\u2019s largest sector, is aiding the latest foray in record territory. Continued concern as to the impact of last week\u2019s Catalonian election victory for pro-independence parties, as well as a Euro recovery from its Christmas Day \u2018flash crash\u2019, are both weighing on mainland European equities, while US futures are clawing back gains following a negative Boxing day session impacted by an Apple sell-off. Commodity price are charging ahead today (doubtless pleasing billionaires in the raw materials sector). The copper price has hit its highest level in over three years, partly due to optimism that the strengthening global economy will push up demand. The prospect of supply cuts was also a factor - with China ordering its top producer to halt output for a week to combat winter pollution. Metal prices are also rising because the US dollar has weakened (as traders ponder the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reform\u2019 plan). Palladium has hit a 17-year high, at $1,069 per ounce, while gold rose to $1.285 per ounce. The world\u2019s roster of billionaires includes Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss, the internet entrepreneurs who made a big investment in bitcoin back in 2011. Their $11m investment is probably worth around $1.3bn today - although their precise fortune is obviously as volatile as bitcoin itself. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA predicts more wild price moves next year.... Bitcoin is going to continue to fascinate traders heading into the new year and while volatility by its own standards has been tame today, it\u2019s likely to remain very active. Speculators appetite for Bitcoin has been tested in the run up to Christmas, with price having fallen from around $20,000 to not far from half that less than a week later, depending on the exchange. While prices have since rebounded back to around $15,000, it will be interesting to see whether we see the kind of wild gains that we\u2019ve become accustomed to in the coming months, or whether the recent decline has shaken people\u2019s confidence in the cryptocurrency. The world\u2019s wealthiest people needn\u2019t worry about their incomes being squeezed, though. New figures from Bloomberg show that the 500 richest people in the world saw their respective wealth expand by an astonishing 23% during 2017, from $4.4 trillion to over $5.3 trillion. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, had the best year - gaining over $34bn to become the world\u2019s richest person at around $99.6bn, thanks to the surge in Amazon\u2019s share price. The report also shows that lesser (!) billionaires also had a vintage year, as the strong gains on the world\u2019s stock markets made the richest even richer (at a time when the average household in the UK was suffering from falling real wages) Here are some of the key points from Bloomberg\u2019s report: The 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index added $177 billion in 2017, a 65 percent gain that was the biggest of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of developer China Evergrande Group, added $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year, and the second-biggest U.S. dollar gain on the index, after Bezos. Technology billionaire Ma Huateng, co-founder of messaging service Tencent Holdings, became Asia\u2019s second-richest person when his fortune nearly doubled to $41 billion. The number of Asian billionaires surpassed the U.S. for the first time, according to a UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The U.S. has the largest presence on the index, with 159 billionaires who added $315 billion, an 18 percent gain that gives them a collective net worth of $2 trillion. Russia\u2019s 27 richest people put behind them the economic pain that followed President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, adding $29 billion to $275 billion, surpassing the collective net worth they had before western economic sanctions began. It was also a banner year for tech moguls, with the 57 technology billionaires on the index adding $262 billion, a 35 percent increase that was the most of any sector on the ranking. Here\u2019s the full story, which could fuel calls for higher wealth taxes to tackle the growing gap between the richest and everyone else. Hmmm, bitcoin\u2019s rally seems to be fizzling out. The digital currency has now dipped back to around $15,500 - wiping out this morning\u2019s gains. This sort of volatility is typical for bitcoin, but maybe the threat of a regulatory clampdown is worrying the market. FXTM\u2019s Hussein Sayed says there are several reasons to be cautious: Israel became the most recent country to propose banning companies based on digital currencies to trade on its stock exchange. A South Korean bitcoin exchange has been hacked, leading it into bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency exchanges are disabling transaction temporarily due to high traffic. Professional traders on CBOE seems to be going short on Bitcoin. Britain should brace itself for another year of falling real wages. In news that might take the sparkle off your new year celebrations, the Resolution Foundation has predicted that pay rises won\u2019t overtake inflation until the end of next year. If they\u2019re right, that would mean the current cost of living squeeze will last two whole years. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, blames the government\u2019s economic policies: \u201cThe Resolution Foundation report succinctly encapsulates the hardship many across Britain are facing under the Tories and will continue to face in 2018. \u201cAfter seven years of Conservative economic mismanagement, the figures speak for themselves. Real wages are still lower than they were in 2010 and Britain faces a productivity crisis. \u201cThis is not a Government willing or able to raise productivity and living standards for people in Britain.\u201d Tech companies are suffering a hangover this morning, following reports that sales of Apple\u2019s new iPhone X have been disappointing. Yesterday Taiwan\u2019s Economic Daily reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter to 30 million units, down from 50 million. This hit Asian chip makers overnight, and European technology companies are now following - sending the Stoxx 600 tech index down 1%. Austrian-based Apple supplier AMS is the biggest casualty, down almost 10% We had been expecting new UK mortgage data today, but it turns out that the figures are actually being released by UK Finance (the industry body) tomorrow. As predicted, European stock markets are rather quiet after the Christmas break. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a modest four points (perhaps traders are being distracted by the snowflakes that are now sweeping through the capital). Mining companies are leading the risers; Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American have all gained around 1.5% while silver producer Fresnillo is up 2%. Jeremy Cook of World First sums up the situation: Bitcoin\u2019s stumble last week came after two exchanges, CME and Cboe, both launched futures markets allowing investors to bet against the cryptocurrency - as this tweet shows: Shares in cryptocurrency-related companies have also risen today, on the back of bitcoin\u2019s rebound. Reuters has the details: Internet provider GMO Internet Inc, which is engaged in the \u201cmining\u201d of bitcoin, rose 3.1%. Remixpoint Inc, an operator of virtual currency trading post services, gained 5%. The bitcoin futures price has also rebounded from last week\u2019s slump. On CME Group\u2019s new bitcoin derivatives market, the price of a bitcoin in January has risen by $430 today to $16,250. The bitcoin futures prices allow traders to bet on bitcoin falling, or rising, in value. As things stand, bitcoin has gained around 1,600% during 2017, despite last week\u2019s wobble. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that bitcoin looks like a bubble -- partly because it\u2019s so hard to put a \u2018proper\u2019 value on it. He writes: After crashing by more than $8,000 from an all-time high, Bitcoin is up 3.5% at the time of writing. Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December. Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation. However, there\u2019s no effective test to measure at which stage we are currently standing. For example, equity prices may be said in a bubble territory if investors are willing to pay much more for a stock than the intrinsic value which is justified by the discounted divided stream. Similarly, econometric tests may be run on bonds, commodities, currencies or any other asset to come up with a justified value. For Bitcoin, there isn\u2019t any fundamental basis to justify the price. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a subdued atmosphere in the City of London this morning as traders struggle through the drizzle back to their desks following the Christmas break. But bitcoin is defying the quiet mood, and staging a strong recovery after its sharp plunge last week which saw it fall from around $19,000 to just $14,000 in two days. The price of bitcoin surged by 13% on Tuesday, and it\u2019s extending those gains again this morning - currently changing hands at around $16,200. That should relieve those who jumped into the cryptocurrency arena in recent weeks, but may also spur concerns that the bitcoin bubble is still inflating. The rally comes despite another crackdown against bitcoin, this time from Israel. On Monday, Israel\u2019s stock market regulator revealed plans to ban companies based on digital currencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, declared that the public need to be protected from potentially unscrupulous bitcoin operations: \u201cIf we have a company that their main business is digital currencies we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended.\u201d Hauser, who clearly isn\u2019t a fan of bitcoin, added: \u201cI think it looks like a bubble, smells like a bubble, acts like a bubble and feels like a bubble. This tough stance may embolden other regulators to take a closer look at bitcoin, which could mean further volatility in the weeks ahead. Apart from bitcoin, City traders will also be watching out for new UK home loan data this morning, and US consumer confidence stats this afternoon (unless they slope off early to finish off the mince pies). The agenda: 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals data for November 3pm GMT: US Consumer Confidence index for December Update: the mortgage approvals figures have been pushed back to Thursday.",
