                "bodyText":"Shares on Wall Street have hit record levels as financial markets around the world anticipate the biggest package of US tax cuts since Ronald Reagan was in the White House in the 1980s. Investors bought heavily into US stocks after Donald Trump received approval from the Senate for reforms that offer the biggest reduction in taxes to corporations and those on high incomes. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 hit record levels in early trading but later fell back because of a sell-off of technology stocks, which have seen substantial price rises this year. But there was heavy buying of telecom, bank, financial and other shares in sectors seen as benefiting from the tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy. The technology sector is expected to benefit less because it already enjoys low tax rates. Although the final details of the package have still to be finalised through an agreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives, Wall Street believes that the president has finally succeeded in a near year-long battle to get Congress to support his plan. The Dow Jones closed just 58 points up, while the S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% down. The latter has risen about 18% since the start of the year on strong corporate earnings, economic growth and confidence that Trump would eventually get his tax cuts. Markets have shrugged off concerns that the cuts, like those in the 1980s, will lead to a ballooning of the US budget deficit.

Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-04T13:44:38.064Z\">at 1.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a2542fcae3bcb05d20248a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-04T12:50:03.233Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live?page=with:block-5a2515b7a1bc53061d9286a7#block-5a2515b7a1bc53061d9286a7\">Britain\u2019s construction</a> and manufacturing sectors picked up in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UlrikBie/status/937663592677158912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While the Brexit divorce negotiations have entered a critical phase, British construction PMI extends a strong rebound <a href=\"https://t.co/Vm0nlWWnwp\">pic.twitter.com/Vm0nlWWnwp</a></p>&mdash; Ulrik Bie (@UlrikBie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UlrikBie/status/937663592677158912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 4, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a253cf7a1bc53061d9287ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-04T12:25:42.695Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live?page=with:block-5a25323f0470380699b541b8#block-5a25323f0470380699b541b8\">those reports of a deal over the Irish borde</a>r.</strong></p> <p><strong>Hamish Muress,</strong> currency analyst at <a href=\"http://www.ofx.com/en-gb/\"><strong>OFX</strong></a>, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months.</p> <p>Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d.

                "bodyText":"So, not the most convincing rally we\u2019ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we\u2019ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to \u2018sell the news\u2019 and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn\u2019t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we\u2019ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That\u2019s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s stock market rally. It\u2019s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here\u2019s Nils\u2019 column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren\u2019t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal\u2019s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It\u2019s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn\u2019t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May\u2019s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today\u2019s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \u201cGetting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn\u2019t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there\u2019s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here\u2019s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \u201cI think this bill is very dangerous,\u201d he said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program. \u201cWhen people lose health insurance, they\u2019re less likely to get preventive care, they\u2019re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they\u2019re more likely to die.\u201d Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county\u2019s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \u201cit was exceptional\u201d it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the \u20ac86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate\u2019s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let\u2019s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump\u2019s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump\u2019s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There\u2019s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate\u2019s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That\u2019d leave the Dow at \u2013 what else \u2013 a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday\u2019s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it\u2019s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country\u2019s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth \u20ac5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today \u2013 less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \u201cAlthough a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\u201d It\u2019s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 \u2018prior actions\u2019 or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures \u2013 a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone \u2013 is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the \u20ac86bn bailout programme, the country\u2019s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain\u2019s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it\u2019s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at \u20ac1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \u201cfar-reaching implications\u201d. But it\u2019s not clear that Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they\u2019re currently propping up Theresa May\u2019s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reforms\u2019 is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland\u2019s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That\u2019s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America\u2019s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate\u2019s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump\u2019s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market\u2019s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \u201cAfter the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \u201cResidential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u201cOn the frontline we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK\u2019s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite \u2018brittle, adding: \u201cAnecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain\u2019s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit\u2019s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain\u2019s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October\u2019s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October\u2019s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \u201cUK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \u201cConstruction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump\u2019s push to cut America\u2019s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies\u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft\u2013currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech\u2019s Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe\u2019s stock markets are recovering from Friday\u2019s shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cEuropean markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend\u2019s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump\u2019s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate\u2019s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President\u2019s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump\u2019s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president\u2019s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \u201cvery, very happy\u2019. But...the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d plan to cut taxes for \u201caverage Americans\u201d has been criticised by experts who say it\u2019s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \u201cIn the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \u201cEvery time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\u201d But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven\u2019t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u201cthere is still a way to go\u201d to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures. Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report 3pm GMT: US factory orders for October",

All have a corporation tax rate of zero.</p> <p>The six named above have been singled out for failing a crucial test \u2013 fair taxation. In particular, these islands \u201cfacilitate offshore structures which attract profits without real economic activity\u201d. Their laws allow companies to book profits without ever really doing business on their shores. These sorts of laws have allowed trillions in untaxed earnings to be syphoned out of Europe\u2019s big consumer markets.

They have until the end of 2018 to do so. Progress will be monitored by an obscure entity called the European code of conduct group on business taxation, which is made up of tax experts from member states and chaired by the Italian mandarin <a href=\"http://www.mef.gov.it/ministero/struttura/capi-dipartimento/direttore-gen-finanze.html\">Fabrizia Lapecorella</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/taxblacklist-zip/giv-3902QX9oWvbUvH23/\" data-alt=\"EU list of tax havens\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/taxblacklist-zip/giv-3902QX9oWvbUvH23/\">EU list of tax havens</a> </figure>  <p>If improvements don\u2019t materialise, these jurisdictions could be added to the blacklist, which is set to be updated annually.

There are some notable exceptions: Panama is deservedly singled out, so too is the United Arab Emirates. But the real action is on an accompanying \u201cgrey list\u201d. It contains 47 names, including the Cayman Islands, Vanuatu, Guernsey, Jersey, Bermuda and the Isle of Man. Followers of the Paradise Papers will have noticed the last two featured prominently in the latest revelations of offshore antics. All have a corporation tax rate of zero. The six named above have been singled out for failing a crucial test \u2013 fair taxation. In particular, these islands \u201cfacilitate offshore structures which attract profits without real economic activity\u201d. Their laws allow companies to book profits without ever really doing business on their shores. These sorts of laws have allowed trillions in untaxed earnings to be syphoned out of Europe\u2019s big consumer markets. Think of the sportswear brand Nike, which used Bermuda and the Netherlands to amass a $12bn offshore cash pile. Greylist members have promised to address tax fairness, transparency and other issues. They have until the end of 2018 to do so. Progress will be monitored by an obscure entity called the European code of conduct group on business taxation, which is made up of tax experts from member states and chaired by the Italian mandarin Fabrizia Lapecorella. If improvements don\u2019t materialise, these jurisdictions could be added to the blacklist, which is set to be updated annually. So, what are the penalties for being blacklisted? Unfortunately, none have been agreed. Pierre Moscovici, the French politician who has led this initiative in his role as finance commissioner in Brussels, is urging member states to pick and choose from a menu of sanctions. The most draconian is withholding taxes: profits cannot leave a member state disguised as interest payments on a loan, or royalties, without being taxed in the market where they were made. At the other end of the scale, tax inspectors could decide to pay special attention to any structures involving these jurisdictions. Many probably already do so. Moscovici is encouraging member states to act unilaterally on sanctions if they cannot agree as a group. France, which has been calling for bigger contributions to state coffers by Google and Apple, may decide to bite. While this blacklist does not pose an immediate threat to tax havens, it is not without teeth.",

It\u2019s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u2019d win the trade, but you\u2019d probably lose the payout.</p> <p>If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity.</p> <p>Which is arguably where we are now.</p> </blockquote> <p>This chart shows how the plan would play out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"709b034ce2b976baf195b755ceeed3b9cabf9a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709b034ce2b976baf195b755ceeed3b9cabf9a34/0_0_591_393/500.png\" alt=\"The bitcoin price\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bitcoin price</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alphaville</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But.... such a plan could still go wrong.

                "bodyText":"Time to recap: It\u2019s been another riproaring day for bitcoin, as the cryprocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Starting the day at $13,600, bitcoin smashed through $14,000 for the first time ever in early European trading. By 9am in New York, it was surging through $15,000. In increasing frenzied trading, bitcoin then hit $19,000 on the coindesk exchange (although Reuters never clocked it above $15,995). It then subsided, as bitcoin exchanges admitted they were struggling to keep up with the huge trading volumes. At today\u2019s prices, the total value of every bitcoin in the world is roughly equal to the market capitalisation of credit card firm Visa. The surge came despite fresh warnings that bitcoin could be a bubble. Sir Howard Davies, chair of Royal Bank of Scotland, said top central banks should cite Dante\u2019s famous warning from the gates of hell - \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019. In the last 12 months, bitcoin has now gained around 2,000%. It\u2019s gone from $11,000 to over $15,000 this week alone, amid signs that retail investors are piling in. Bitcoin is due to enter the mainstream next week, when clearing houses begin offering futures trading. But, several US banks are reluctant to take part, according to the Wall Street Journal. Analysts are split over whether futures trading will bring some calm to bitcoin. It could push the price down, as investors will be able to bet on a crash. But if money keeps pouring in, the price could head higher.... But investors were also reminded of the dangers of cybercrime, as a bitcoin wallet firm revealed it had been hacked. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Wall Street has just closed for the day, with small gains on the main indices. The Dow gained 70 points, or 0.3% - a performance matched by the S&amp;P 500. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose by 0.5%, partly thanks to Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Mark Hamrick,Washington bureau chief for Bankrate.com, reports that some investors aren\u2019t happy about missing out on bitcoin: Two major US banks have decided not to offer bitcoin futures trading when it launches this weekend. That follows concerns (covered in this blog earlier today) that the systems aren\u2019t robust enough. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports: Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. are telling customers that they won\u2019t offer them access to the first bitcoin futures market when it goes live on Sunday, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. futures broker, will offer access but only for certain customers, a person familiar with the situation said. ABN Amro Group will be handling trades for \u201ca small selected group of professional clients,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Dutch bank said in an e-mail. Morgan Stanley and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA are still evaluating their approach to bitcoin futures, other people said Thursday. CNN\u2019s Seth Fiegerman joined the bitcoin party last week, when he invested $100 in the digital currency. He\u2019s now written a handy explainer - here\u2019s a flavour: Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack. Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product. There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone. With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer. My original $100 bitcoin purchase won\u2019t officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won\u2019t be able to sell at the earliest until Friday. If the price plummets before then, I\u2019m out of luck. However, Mrs Fiegerman isn\u2019t impressed (and this is after the price went up!) City investor Justin Urquhart Stewart reports that his cabbie is interested in bitcoin.... Borrowing money to buy into a rising asset... that\u2019s one of the classic signs of a bubble, associated with the dreaded Minsky Moment (when prices suddenly collapse as speculators can\u2019t service their loans) Right now, bitcoin is trading at $15,300, according to the \u2018spot price\u2019 on my Reuters terminal. That\u2019s a gain of 12% today, and up over 40% since the start of the week Earlier it jumped to the brink of $16,000 (Reuters\u2019 data shows) but was seen rather higher on some other exchanges. Some bitcoin exchanges are struggling to handle the interest today, it seems. Coinbase, the largest US bitcoin, blamed \u2018record high traffic\u2019 for technical problems: Bitcoin wallet provider Trezor had a similar story: This may not reassure critics who wonder how the bitcoin ecosystem will cope with the next price correction..... Ian Guider of Ireland\u2019s Sunday Business Post spies a bubble... Speaking of volatile trading, bitcoin prices on the coinbase exchange just rocketed towards $20,000. But it swiftly slumped back to less stratospheric levels. What wild times! The bitcoin price has been particularly volatile today, as it struck a series of new highs: It won\u2019t be easy to run a future market in such a volatile asset..... Economics professor Justin Wolfers has put his finger on the problem with bitcoin pricing - it\u2019s hard to bet against it today. The launch of bitcoin futures markets on Sunday night will be an important moment, says Neil Wilson of City firm ETX. But he doesn\u2019t agree that letting traders bet against bitcoin necessarily means its price will fall. Wilson explains: At least with regulated futures the market ought to behave more normally than it has done \u2013 notwithstanding some pretty major spasms in the market that are likely on Sunday night and Monday morning as the contracts launch - and this would be net bearish for Bitcoin overall as it will allow proper shorting and hedging strategies. At present the only way to short is to sell your bitcoin and exit the market, a bias that favours bulls. The ability to go short creates a new dynamic in the market and may result in a significant shock to prices. The problem is anyone shorting against this headwind of rapidly rising prices needs to be able to sweat out huge potential upside. As plenty before have noted, Bitcoin might keep rising longer than shorts can stay solvent.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on Bitcoin\u2019s rally, and the concerns building about it..... Bitcoin has been likened to Dante\u2019s Inferno by the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged above $15,000 on Thursday, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors. Davies, a former head of the UK\u2019s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. Bitcoin has increased in value by $3,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,300 at lunchtime on Thursday. \u201cPut up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. Davies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. \u201cCentral banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],\u201d he said.... More here: Analyst Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that bitcoin usage isn\u2019t keeping pace with its price: A majority of City investors think that bitcoin is an unsustainable bubble. That\u2019s according to a survey of institutional investors, conducted by Natixis Investment Managers, which found: Institutional investors may believe bubbles have formed in both the bond (42%) and stock (30%) markets, but concerns for these traditional assets pale in comparison to the 64% who say there\u2019s a bubble in Bitcoins. Over on FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska has a fascinating theory to explain bitcoin\u2019s rise. In short, it\u2019s that certain investors have piled into bitcoin, driving its price every higher, because they plan to \u2018short\u2019 it next week. Shorting becomes a serious option once the CME clearing house launches its derivatives contracts next week. So if you\u2019ve invested the time and money to stock up on bitcoin this year, you could make immense profits if you short the cryptocurrency next week. She explains: Without the certainty of a properly regulated marketplace defending the futures side of the equation, a payoff cannot be guaranteed. It\u2019s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u2019d win the trade, but you\u2019d probably lose the payout. If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity. Which is arguably where we are now. This chart shows how the plan would play out: But.... such a plan could still go wrong. For example: The futures launch is suspended unexpectedly, perhaps due to regulatory concerns or industry pushback? The anticipated futures demand never arrives because the margin costs of holding open long positions proves to be too great and/or liquidity is so shoddy nobody can trade effectively. The cash settled return on the futures leg, won\u2019t necessarily be matched by the price achieved on the physical liquidation. More here: The smartest bitcoin trade in town? Wowzers! Bitcoin has now surged to $16,000 on one exchange: That means it\u2019s gained more than $3,000 since yesterday morning. In any bubble, there\u2019s a moment when new investors are lured in by reports of hefty profits, helping to drive the price higher and higher. Is that where we are now with bitcoin? And how much higher will it go? Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA predict a correction is looming.... The cryptocurrency has undoubtedly come on leaps and bounds this year but it\u2019s difficult to see anything move as Bitcoin has and not fear a devastating bubble bursting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that Bitcoin has been making headlines over the last week or so, during which time it\u2019s risen another $5,000, or 50%. If speculation is playing as big a role in the latest moves as some expect, then very interesting times may lie ahead. Although as is always the case, this could rise a lot more before the bubble bursts. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: So, where are all these people who have made fortunes out of bitcoin? The Daily Telegraph have found one - and he\u2019s still just a teenager. They say: Eddy Zillan was 16 when he began investing in bitcoin, just two years later, the youthful investor estimates he has \u201cmade close to a million\u201d from trading in various cryptocurrency. The perspicacious Ohio teenager was an early adopter of the bubble and bust digital currency, investing in 2015 when bitcoin\u2019s price was as low as $214 following a prolonged bear market. \u201cI started off with $1,000 to play around with out of my savings,\u201d he told The Telegraph. \u201cI then acquired another $5,000 through my bar mitzvah money (in 2012). \u201cI then invested another $6,000 through money I earned and saved from working summer jobs.\u201d... Here\u2019s a useful non-technical explanation of bitcoin: Anyone who bought bitcoin two weeks ago (when it was trading at $8,000) has almost doubled their money. They won\u2019t give you that at your local bank! But, of course, that\u2019s exactly why some experts fear that a speculative bubble is building. Bitcoin buyers aren\u2019t heeding Sir Howard Davies\u2019s warning. The cryptocurrency just hit a new alltime high, at $15,200, as American traders arrive at their desks. Just in: The US jobs market remained strong last week. Just 236,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit during the seven days to 2nd December. That\u2019s down from 238,000 the previous week, and the third weekly decline in a row. Yann Quelenn of Swissbank believes bitcoin will keep climbing this month, perhaps even hitting $20,000 -- before suffering an abrupt reversal. Quelenn writes: Sheer greed is driving the cryptocurrency higher, perhaps to $20,000 per coin by Christmas. This would put Bitcoin\u2019s market cap above $300bn, one third that of Apple! Bitcoin is unique in history, true, but a correction will likely be very tough. Two Chicago exchanges, the CBOE and the CME, will soon launch trading of cryptocurrency futures. This signals an impending stampede of institutional investors \u2013 many speculators, some hedgers. Just watch the fireworks fly. Sir Howard Davies\u2019s hint that bitcoin is a hellish investment for the unwary is somewhat ironic, given the track record of the bank he chairs. Royal Bank of Scotland has been controlled by the UK taxpayer for nearly a decade, having been bailed out after nearly collapsing after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has made a steady stream of losses ever since, and the British government is now planning to crystallise a \u00a326m loss when it sells its RBS shares over the next few years. Davies can\u2019t be blame for RBS\u2019s plight, as he only joined in 2015. But the legacy of the financial crisis is exactly why some people believe cryptocurrencies make a lots of sense. Workers at GE Power have just had a very nasty shock. The US company is axing 12,000 jobs across the globe in a cost-cutting drive. The move includes 1,100 workers at its UK operations, mainly in Stafford and Rugby. GE blamed falling demand for fossil fuel power plants, saying: \u201cTraditional power markets including gas and coal have softened\u201d. Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!, is more optimistic about bitcoin\u2019s future. Yang reckons digital currencies can be a force for good in the long term. The key it to treat bitcoin as an actual currency, not an asset whose price has been driven up by speculation. As Yang put it to CNBC: \u201cBitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet. Personally, I am a believer in how digital currency can play a role in our society\u2026 but for now, it seems like it\u2019s more driven by the hype of investing and getting a return rather than using it as a transaction currency. The FT points out that Bitcoin has hit $15,000 on some crypto-exchanges. Look at that spread of prices, though! No wonder the US banks have concerns about bitcoin derivatives contracts hitting the markets...... Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, has issued a dire warning against investing in bitcoin. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, as bitcoin headed towards $15,000, Davies warned that the digital currency looked like a \u201cfrothy investment bubble\u201d. He\u2019s concerned that bitcoin doesn\u2019t really fall under any one regulator\u2019s remit, meaning the adults in the room aren\u2019t warning of the risks. Davies says it\u2019s hard to see any \u2018rational reason\u2019 for bitcoin\u2019s recent surge: All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno - \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019. That\u2019s what\u2019s needed, and it need to done by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank at the same time. So why aren\u2019t the world\u2019s top central bankers acting? Davies suspects they\u2019re worried about being seen as luddites if they criticise digital currencies, adding: The market is telling us something about the need for new faster payments systems. [But] I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s bitcoin in the long run. But should bitcoin actually be outlawed, as economist Joseph Stiglitz argues? No, replies Davies - if you ban bitcoin, other variants will simply take its place. Here\u2019s our story about the problems at NiceHash: The pound\u2019s volatility has hit its highest level in almost six months, as Brexit headines shunt sterling around: The old mantra Caveat Emptor goes without saying where bitcoin is concerned. Not only is its value uncertain (\u2018higher than yesterday\u2019 won\u2019t be true forever), but you run the risk of losing your bitcoins to a cybercriminal. Overnight, Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoins. It\u2019s a blow to bitcoin miners who had contributed their computing power to mine bitcoins through NiceHash. Users reckon that NiceHash\u2019s bitcoin wallet had held around 4,736.42 bitcoins \u2014 equivalent to over $66m at current prices. Here\u2019s the official statement: More reaction to Bitcoin\u2019s latest spike: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says Bitcoin\u2019s rise looks unstoppable -- but the launch of those bitcoin futures could change things. Bitcoin bulls have driven the virtual currency beyond $14,500 for the first time. The bitcoin has jumped 20% over the last 24 hours with buyers of the virtual currency now eyeing up $20,000. Given the fact that both the CBOE and the CME exchanges will begin offering bitcoin futures this month, perhaps the prediction of $20,000 is not that far off? However, the start of futures trading also means the start of short trades on the bitcoin, which could increase volatility further. Now this is interesting. The Financial Times is reporting that some of the world\u2019s largest banks are resisting the imminent launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading will allow people to trade the digital currency without actually owning it. It\u2019s means to open bitcoin up to a wider range of investors. However, given bitcoin\u2019s volatility, some industry figures fear that the clearing houses that underpins the markets could suffer massive losses if the cryptocurrency were to crash. The FT says: The world\u2019s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market. However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday. In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures \u201cdid not allow for proper public transparency and input\u201d. Newsflash: UK house prices kept rising last month, according to the latest data from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices rose by 0.5% during November, leaving them 3.9% higher than a year ago. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, says the Bank of England\u2019s (well-flagged) interest rate hike last month hasn\u2019t spooked buyers: \u201cThe improved performance of the market in the latest quarter suggests the first interest rate rise in a decade may have ignited demand. \u201cOn this evidence, the November rate rise has brought prospective buyers out into the open rather than sent them underground. \u201cMany buyers may have come to the conclusion that it is better to move now while mortgage rates are still low than further down the line when they could be less competitive. Currency traders may need to don their tin hats in the coming days, as the Brexit negotiations intensify. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, predicts plenty of volatility: \u201cEurope is the only show in town right now, and ongoing speculation around a solution to the Irish border issue has further dampened enthusiasm for sterling. A deal must be done by close of play Friday if Brexit talks are to move onto trade after next week\u2019s summit. Reality is, deadlines will likely get extended, whisper from Brussels will raise and dash expectations, and we may or may not get anything at the end of it. Prepare for a volatile couple of days on the currency markets. Merger news: GVC, the gambling giant behind Foxy Bingo and PartyCasino, is in talks over a \u00a33.9bn takeover of Ladbrokes. Shares in both companies have jumped in early trading (Ladbrokes surged by over 25%). If successful, it would create one of the world\u2019s largest betting firms. Ladbrokes could welcome a takeover, given the mounting criticism over its fixed-odds betting terminals (savaged as being \u2018crack cocaine\u2019 of gambling). The final value of the deal will partly depend on the government\u2019s clampdown on FOBT, which could take a chunk out of Ladbrokes profits. Geopolitical issues are high on the market\u2019s agenda today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: Politics will again be to the fore as UK government attempts to find some compromise on the hypersensitive issue of the Irish border, while the fall-out from Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital threatens to escalate already enormous tensions across the Middle East, and quite obviously contradicts UN resolution 478. Last night\u2019s price surge was remarkable, even by bitcoin\u2019s recent standards: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as traders worry that Britain may not get a Brexit breakthrough before Christmas. Sterling dipped overnight to $1.337 against the US dollar, with no immediate sign of an end to the deadlock over the Irish border question. That\u2019s almost two cents lower than Monday, when optimism of a deal was rising. It\u2019s also a little weaker against the euro, at \u20ac1.133. Tensions mounted after Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said the UK must agree the text on a potential deal by Friday night. Otherwise, the two sides can\u2019t shift onto taking about that precious trade deal. Time is running short, as analysts at FxPro warn this morning.... If talks do not move on to the next stage of discussions in December then the terms of a transition period will likely be pushed back until the next European council summit of leaders in March, by which time many businesses in the UK will have had to make decisions over their location and investments in the country. So, the City is looking to Westminster for some serious progress between the UK government, the DUP (it\u2019s Northern Irish partners) and Dublin. But if each side sticks to its principles, this will be tough - so sterling could have a choppy ride. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to soar at an ever faster rate. The digital currency battered its way through the $14,000 mark overnight, having hit $12,000 yesterday. More consumers are jumping into bitcoin - presumably having heard stories of its rapid ascent. Institutional investors are also taking more interest, as they\u2019ll soon be able to buy and sell bitcoin derivative contracts. It will intensify the argument between those who think bitcoin is a monetary paradigm shift, and those who see a dangerous bubble. Par example: We\u2019ll also be watching out for new UK house price figures, updated eurozone growth stats and the weekly US unemployment report: The agenda 8.30am GMT: Halifax UK house price survey for November 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP statistics for Q3 2016 (second estimate) 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless claims 4pm GMT: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks at a press conference held by the Bank for International Settlement.",

The early positive momentum in sterling, ran out of steam and it then the pound turned negative \u2013 which propped up the FTSE 100.</p> </blockquote> <p>Part of the reason for the fall was the EU telling the UK that trade talks would not start until February.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T16:51:58.152Z\">at 4.51pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a2ab79c32ead406c971425c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T16:05:50.652Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ratings agency Fitch has also <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/10014154\">opined on the Brexit news</a> from this morning, and like S&amp;P, says it has no immediate effect on its AA rating and negative outlook:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The agreement between the UK and the EU to move to the next phase of Brexit negotiations is a step towards a potential agreement on Brexit and trade, but the process remains lengthy and challenging, and the deal leaves many key uncertainties unresolved...</p> <p>The progress report\u2019s carefully crafted language fails to clarify how the UK can achieve all three of its commitments to leave the EU single market and customs union, ensure Northern Ireland retains \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the UK internal market, and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It states that \u201cin the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which... support North-South cooperation\u201d. This would appear to maintain the status quo if a trade deal is not agreed, but we think it would be politically very difficult for the UK government to guarantee regulatory equivalence between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in this event.</p> <p>More broadly, the negotiation process leading up to today\u2019s announcement has strained UK domestic politics, highlighting how June\u2019s general election has weakened policy cohesion, reflecting divisions in parliament and among the UK public regarding the desired post-Brexit relationship with the EU, and meaning the final outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. </p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, today\u2019s announcement does not alter the view we expressed when we affirmed the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating in October, that the complexity of the issues, the magnitude of national interests at stake, the lack of a clear UK position, the EU\u2019s negotiating stance, and the limited timeframe will make it challenging for the UK to secure a favourable trade agreement.

The consultancy\u2019s Andrew Kenningham says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike the bubbles in the tech sector in the late-1990s and in US residential property a few years later, a bursting of the bitcoin bubble should not have systemic, macroeconomic implications. The total value of bitcoin is (still) too small, and it has few links with the wider economy.</p> <p>...As with many start-ups, the \u201ctrue\u201d value of bitcoin is unknown because it is unclear whether it has a long- term future. But we doubt that any cryptocurrency will become a serious rival to the dollar or other major fiat currencies, many of which have centuries of history behind them and the backing of governments and central banks. Also, technological problems, fraud or tighter regulation may undermine bitcoin. And even if cryptocurrencies in general have a future, one of bitcoin\u2019s numerous competitors, or a central bank digital currency, could kill it off just as plenty of early rivals to Facebook and Google were sunk without trace.</p> <p>Given this uncertainty, it makes sense that bitcoin is often compared to the famous Dutch tulip bubble. Like bitcoin, tulips became popular \u201cbecause of their strangeness and rarity\u201d and because they were new, having arrived from the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. Their prices rose astronomically between 1634 and 1637 and then collapsed. But the crash apparently had little impact on the Dutch economy.</p> <p>There are several channels through which a bursting asset price bubble can, in principle, have macroeconomic consequences, but none are a major risk in the case of bitcoin.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f24157485aad1b3f352967cbbd87973e09b699e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f24157485aad1b3f352967cbbd87973e09b699e5/0_3_700_467/500.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoincap8dec\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>First, there may be a hit to household spending as people who have invested suffer losses. But bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is too small for this to be a worry. It is currently around $240bn, which is much smaller than the total value of gold outstanding ($8trn) or the value of Apple ($0.9trn). If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller.</p> <p>While a bursting bubble can affect the economy via the banking sector, this is not much of a risk either, precisely because bitcoin is held and traded outside the banking sector. Also, there is no evidence that people are taking out huge, sub-prime mortgages to finance their speculation in cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>A slump in bitcoin prices should not have much effect on wider investor and business confidence either. As we have pointed out elsewhere, there is no correlation between the prices of bitcoin and other risky assets, so a fall in its price should not affect wider financial conditions. And nor would it tell us anything about wider market sentiment. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a2aafeb32ead406c97141df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T15:31:28.079Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Bitcoin, and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\">a notable critic of the cryptocurrency</a> - has been commenting again.

James Smith at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For markets, a further disappointment in wage growth will be the key takeaway from today\u2019s data. November\u2019s growth in average hourly earnings came in below consensus at 0.2%, following a downward revision to October\u2019s figure, although it\u2019s still probably worth taking these numbers with a pinch of salt. Back in September, the job losses from the hurricanes were highly concentrated in low-wage sectors, and taking them temporarily out of the sample artificially boosted the average level of pay. November\u2019s disappointment could simply be a further correction to this blip.</p> <p>A similar logic can probably be applied to the payrolls numbers. On the face of it, a 228,000 increase in jobs during November looks good, but at least some of this is probably down to people returning to work after the disruption. Either way though, policymakers are less bothered by jobs growth these days - they know that the rate of employment growth should be expected to slow as the remaining slack in the economy erodes.</p> <p>Given all the noise, the Fed will most likely write off this latest jobs report. Wage growth was disappointing, but given the sheer strength of the jobs market, we would still expect pay to accelerate gradually through next year. More broadly, we agree with the Fed\u2019s assertion that most of this year\u2019s inflation dip was \u2018transitory\u2019. Throw in 3% economic growth next year, as well as the hawkish rotation in regional Fed voters, and we expect a rate hike next week to be followed by three more in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a2a98abeca6e706a5519efa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T14:01:04.980Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US jobs report paves way for Fed rate hike next week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A stronger than expected rise in non-farm payrolls has reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. </p> <p><strong>Paul Ashwell</strong>, chief US economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, gives his view:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The slightly bigger than expected 228,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in November all but guarantees another 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed next week, particularly with the unemployment rate unchanged at an unusually low 4.1%.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a2a957d24e47405c4d716cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-08T13:41:41.418Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The 228,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month was driven by job creation in professional services, manufacturing, and health care, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">US Labor Department </a>said.</p> <p>The department gave some context behind its recent revisions, which it said painted a brighter picture overall:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The change in total non-farm payroll employment for September was revised up from +18,000 to +38,000, and the change for October was revised down from +261,000 to +244,000. </p> <p>With these revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 3,000 more than previously reported.

                "bodyText":"A couple of positive political developments helped push European markets higher, while Wall Street benefitted from the stronger than expected US jobs data. The Brexit breakthrough was welcomed by investors, and even the pound losing its early gains helped the UK market, packed as it is with overseas earners which are helped by a weak sterling. In Germany, hopes that the current impasse in forming a coalition government could be resolved lifted the Dax higher. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 73.21 points or 1% at 7393.96 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.83% to 13,153.70 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.28% higher at 5399.09 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.4% to 22,773.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% better at 10,321.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.64% to 740.72 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 102 points or 0.42% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The early excitement in the pound following the morning\u2019s Brexit news was well and truly short lived, and sterling is now down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3370. In the wake of the deal news it climbed as high as $1.3519. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: At the start of the session, sterling was gaining ground on the back of the announcement that the UK and the EU had made sufficient progress in the first phase talks, so it can now move onto the discussions about trade. The early positive momentum in sterling, ran out of steam and it then the pound turned negative \u2013 which propped up the FTSE 100. Part of the reason for the fall was the EU telling the UK that trade talks would not start until February. Ratings agency Fitch has also opined on the Brexit news from this morning, and like S&amp;P, says it has no immediate effect on its AA rating and negative outlook: The agreement between the UK and the EU to move to the next phase of Brexit negotiations is a step towards a potential agreement on Brexit and trade, but the process remains lengthy and challenging, and the deal leaves many key uncertainties unresolved... The progress report\u2019s carefully crafted language fails to clarify how the UK can achieve all three of its commitments to leave the EU single market and customs union, ensure Northern Ireland retains \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the UK internal market, and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It states that \u201cin the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which... support North-South cooperation\u201d. This would appear to maintain the status quo if a trade deal is not agreed, but we think it would be politically very difficult for the UK government to guarantee regulatory equivalence between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in this event. More broadly, the negotiation process leading up to today\u2019s announcement has strained UK domestic politics, highlighting how June\u2019s general election has weakened policy cohesion, reflecting divisions in parliament and among the UK public regarding the desired post-Brexit relationship with the EU, and meaning the final outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. Fitch concludes: Overall, today\u2019s announcement does not alter the view we expressed when we affirmed the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating in October, that the complexity of the issues, the magnitude of national interests at stake, the lack of a clear UK position, the EU\u2019s negotiating stance, and the limited timeframe will make it challenging for the UK to secure a favourable trade agreement. The Negative Outlook on the rating reflects the uncertainty and corresponding downside economic and fiscal risks. Any bursting of the Bitcoin bubble is unlikely to have a major impact on the global economy, says Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s Andrew Kenningham says: Unlike the bubbles in the tech sector in the late-1990s and in US residential property a few years later, a bursting of the bitcoin bubble should not have systemic, macroeconomic implications. The total value of bitcoin is (still) too small, and it has few links with the wider economy. ...As with many start-ups, the \u201ctrue\u201d value of bitcoin is unknown because it is unclear whether it has a long- term future. But we doubt that any cryptocurrency will become a serious rival to the dollar or other major fiat currencies, many of which have centuries of history behind them and the backing of governments and central banks. Also, technological problems, fraud or tighter regulation may undermine bitcoin. And even if cryptocurrencies in general have a future, one of bitcoin\u2019s numerous competitors, or a central bank digital currency, could kill it off just as plenty of early rivals to Facebook and Google were sunk without trace. Given this uncertainty, it makes sense that bitcoin is often compared to the famous Dutch tulip bubble. Like bitcoin, tulips became popular \u201cbecause of their strangeness and rarity\u201d and because they were new, having arrived from the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. Their prices rose astronomically between 1634 and 1637 and then collapsed. But the crash apparently had little impact on the Dutch economy. There are several channels through which a bursting asset price bubble can, in principle, have macroeconomic consequences, but none are a major risk in the case of bitcoin. First, there may be a hit to household spending as people who have invested suffer losses. But bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is too small for this to be a worry. It is currently around $240bn, which is much smaller than the total value of gold outstanding ($8trn) or the value of Apple ($0.9trn). If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller. While a bursting bubble can affect the economy via the banking sector, this is not much of a risk either, precisely because bitcoin is held and traded outside the banking sector. Also, there is no evidence that people are taking out huge, sub-prime mortgages to finance their speculation in cryptocurrencies. A slump in bitcoin prices should not have much effect on wider investor and business confidence either. As we have pointed out elsewhere, there is no correlation between the prices of bitcoin and other risky assets, so a fall in its price should not affect wider financial conditions. And nor would it tell us anything about wider market sentiment. Back with Bitcoin, and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon - a notable critic of the cryptocurrency - has been commenting again. He told CNBC: US consumer confidence has slipped back compared to last month, partly due to Democrat voters concerned about the effects of the proposed tax changes. The University of Michigan\u2019s initial consumer sentiment reading for December has come in at 96.8, compared to November\u2019s 98.5 and expectations of a rise to 99. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment has remained quite favorable although it continued to slowly recede in early December from its October cyclical peak. Most of the recent decline was concentrated in the long-term prospects for the economy, while consumers thought current economic conditions have continued to improve. Importantly, the largest decline in long-term economic prospects was recorded among Democrats, which reflected their concerns about the impact of the proposed changes in taxes. Perhaps the most important changes in early December were higher income expectations as well as a higher expected inflation rate in 2018. Income gains have been slowly improving during the past year, and the data indicate that trend has continued. In contrast, the rise in inflation expectations in early December was a surprise, and confidence in this finding must await confirmation in the months ahead before any inferences are drawn. Buying plans for durables have improved in early December, largely due to attractive pricing, in contrast to the rise in the expected inflation rate. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.7% in real consumption expenditures in 2018. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is about to begin a round of talks in the US aimed at the debt-stricken country re-accessing markets next year. Helena Smith reports: After eight years of being exiled from international capital markets, Greece hopes to refinance itself for the first time in nearly a decade when its third international bailout programme expires next August. The politics of regaining market access are expected to dominate discussions Tsakalotos is to have in the US, starting today. Auditors representing the European creditors that have kept Greece afloat are also there. The Marxist economist, who has allowed pragmatism to prevail over ideology in his job as finance minister, will be the keynote speaker in the annual Capital Link Invest in Greece Forum on Monday. Interestingly, he has been selected to ring the closing bell at the NYSE on Tuesday. Insiders are interpreting the move as an incipient signal of renewed optimism in the Greek economy. As for that jobs data, it continues its record breaking run: The better than expected jobs data has seen a positive opening on Wall Street, while European markets continue to be buoyed - partly - by the day\u2019s Brexit news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 70 points or 0.29%, with a US rate rise next week now seen as virtually inevitable despite the weaker than expected wages growth. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.37% and the Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.7% Elsewhere the FTSE 100 has climbed 0.87%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.44%. Over at Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is now down around 8% at $15,200. Back with Brexit, and S&amp;P Global Ratings says the UK\u2019s credit rating at AA and its negative outlook is not immediately affected by this morning\u2019s deal. It says: The EC has announced that the UK has made \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the first phase of the Brexit talks, which now paves the way for the EC to formally open the next phase in its summit on December 14 and 15. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled that a final agreement will have to be reached by October 2018. This leaves only 10 months for the UK to agree with the EU a framework for their future relationship, including a trade deal, and transitional arrangements. A final agreement will have to be approved by 27 national parliaments ahead of the March 2019 exit date. While sufficient progress has been made during the first phase, many issues are yet to be fully resolved. The situation is further challenged by the UK\u2019s slowing domestic economy, the lack of a parliamentary majority, and by the absence of consensus within the government on the shape of the final relationship with the EU. Indeed, these considerations contributed to the slow progress during the first phase of negotiations. The negative outlook reflects the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU after the country\u2019s departure from the bloc in March 2019. The dollar is dipping after the weaker than expected US wage growth outweighed the stronger jobs figures. But economists believe that wage weakness will not deter the Federal Reserve from raising US interest rates at its meeting next week. James Smith at ING Bank said: For markets, a further disappointment in wage growth will be the key takeaway from today\u2019s data. November\u2019s growth in average hourly earnings came in below consensus at 0.2%, following a downward revision to October\u2019s figure, although it\u2019s still probably worth taking these numbers with a pinch of salt. Back in September, the job losses from the hurricanes were highly concentrated in low-wage sectors, and taking them temporarily out of the sample artificially boosted the average level of pay. November\u2019s disappointment could simply be a further correction to this blip. A similar logic can probably be applied to the payrolls numbers. On the face of it, a 228,000 increase in jobs during November looks good, but at least some of this is probably down to people returning to work after the disruption. Either way though, policymakers are less bothered by jobs growth these days - they know that the rate of employment growth should be expected to slow as the remaining slack in the economy erodes. Given all the noise, the Fed will most likely write off this latest jobs report. Wage growth was disappointing, but given the sheer strength of the jobs market, we would still expect pay to accelerate gradually through next year. More broadly, we agree with the Fed\u2019s assertion that most of this year\u2019s inflation dip was \u2018transitory\u2019. Throw in 3% economic growth next year, as well as the hawkish rotation in regional Fed voters, and we expect a rate hike next week to be followed by three more in 2018. A stronger than expected rise in non-farm payrolls has reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. Paul Ashwell, chief US economist at Capital Economics, gives his view: The slightly bigger than expected 228,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in November all but guarantees another 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed next week, particularly with the unemployment rate unchanged at an unusually low 4.1%. The 228,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month was driven by job creation in professional services, manufacturing, and health care, the US Labor Department said. The department gave some context behind its recent revisions, which it said painted a brighter picture overall: The change in total non-farm payroll employment for September was revised up from +18,000 to +38,000, and the change for October was revised down from +261,000 to +244,000. With these revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 3,000 more than previously reported. After revisions, job gains have averaged 170,000 over the last 3 months. Non-farm payrolls rose by 228,000 in November, beating expectations of 200,000. But the figure for October was revised down to 244,000 from an earlier estimate of 261,000. The jobless rate was unchanged at 4.1%, while average earnings increased by 0.2%, following a 0.1% fall in October. It was below expectations of a 0.3% pick-up in pay. The pound is now down against both the dollar and the euro, after rising earlier in the day against both currencies. The relief rally prompted by progress on Brexit talks appears to have faded away. The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar, at $1.3405, and down 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1409. Back to Brexit, and the Institute of Directors says firms are breathing \u201ca huge sigh of relief\u201d after talks progressed. Stephen Martin, director general, adds: The most pressing concern for UK companies has been their EU staff, who have urgently needed certainty about their future in this country. We have grounds to hope now that our members will be able to send their employees off for the Christmas break feeling more comfortable about their status here. We call on the UK and EU to build on this positive momentum going into the new year. It is overwhelmingly in the interests of both sides to begin working on our future economic relationship - particularly in order to fully address the Irish question. And we look forward to further clarity about what the UK\u2019s objectives are for that new relationship as well as a firm commitment on transition in the very near future. The US Commerce Department is due to publish the non-farm payrolls report for November at 1.30pm UK time. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting that the US economy created 200,000 jobs last month, down from 261,000 in October. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.1%. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says: When it comes to the US jobs report, the devil is always in the detail so keep an eye out for revisions to previous reports. The average earnings figures will be closely watched too. On a monthly basis, average earnings are expected to jump to 0.3% from 0.0%, and on year-on-year basis it is anticipated to rise to 2.5% from 2.4%. Wage growth has been lagging behind that of job creation growth, and we will need to see a steady rise in earnings if the US economy wants to have a sustainable recovery. Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in the three months to October, figures published earlier by the ONS show. The UK continues to import more from the EU and the rest of the world than it exports to other countries. Excluding some commodities such as gold shipped in and out of London, which statisticians say can distort the figures, the UK\u2019s trade in goods and deficit widened by \u00a3800m to \u00a36.9bn in the three months to October. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to November. That would be an slight improvement on the 0.4% growth achieved in the third quarter, between July and September. Amit Kara, head of UK forecasting at the think tank, said growth was being driven by the services sector and industrial production, while construction remained under pressure. He added: UK economic activity has picked-up in the second half of this year and GDP growth at 0.5 per cent is somewhat higher than the economy\u2019s speed limit. If, as we expect, the economy continues to expand around this pace and inflation remains elevated, there is a case for the Bank of England to gradually raise the policy rate to stop the economy from overheating. Consistent with that view, our latest forecast for the UK is conditioned on a 25 basis points increase in Bank Rate every six months such that the policy rate reaches 2 per cent in 2021. The pound is still up against the euro at \u20ac1.1463 after this morning\u2019s Brexit breakthrough, but it has failed to hold on to earlier gains against the dollar, because the US currency is also performing well on tax plan hopes. Gold is another victim of the dollar\u2019s strength: UK Finance, the banking industry\u2019s trade body, says most of the hard work on Brexit - the aspects that will determine decisions on jobs - is yet to be done. Stephen Jones, chief executive: Today\u2019s announcement is certainly a positive step, making important progress in the negotiations and bringing a welcome and significant clarity on the rights of EU citizens living and working in the UK. But the agreement on phase one issues is just the start - we now need to see the detail and further action on those issues that will determine the real impact of Brexit on the economy, consumers and jobs. Businesses need to see clear progress in the New Year on the future trading relationship and how we will transition to any new arrangements to ensure we can continue to meet the needs of customers. Kathrin Muehlbronner, lead sovereign analyst for the UK at Moody\u2019s, says Brexit progress is currently panning out as the ratings agency expected, with the toughest challenges ahead: The announcement this morning that the UK and the EU have reached \u201csufficient\u201d progress in the withdrawal negotiations is in line with what we expected. We expect the EU summit on 14-15 December to endorse the Commission\u2019s recommendation, meaning that negotiations will now move on to finding agreements on a transition period and a new trade relationship. Our baseline scenario assumes that the two sides will agree on a two-year transition period beyond March 2019, that will give some additional time to find a reasonably good new free trade arrangement. But it is clear that these negotiations will likely be even more difficult than those just concluded on the principles of the UK\u2019s withdrawal. UK construction output fell 1.7% in October, coming in well below economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.4% rise. The fall was driven by a drop in both new work and in repair and maintenance. The ONS explains: Construction output fell by \u00a3211 million compared with September 2017. As in the three-month on three-month series, the fall stems primarily from a decrease in repair and maintenance, with non-housing repair and maintenance falling by \u00a373 million. Private housing also provided a notable drag on output, also decreasing by \u00a373 million. Elsewhere, private commercial work also fell sharply, decreasing for the second consecutive month, falling by \u00a358 million in October 2017. The only positive contributions to the month-on-month construction output came from infrastructure and private industrial work, which grew by \u00a336 million and \u00a314 million respectively. The City of London has welcomed the breakthrough in Brexit talks, saying \u201cChristmas has come early\u201d for financial firms. Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation: Christmas has come early for financial firms with the news that Brexit negotiations can now move to Phase 2. Government has made a bold but necessary step forward. But the hard work starts now. The UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU will mark one of the most important pieces of legislation in a century \u2013 it is vital we get it right first time. The new trading relationship should be based on a free trade agreement, introducing a joint dispute resolution body and mechanisms for mutual market access. It would be based on regulatory alignment between the UK and EU with both parties working together to implement new global and international standards, replacing existing regulatory frameworks. It is essential that government makes clear its aim to implement a transitional deal, clarifying exact timelines of when the transition phase will begin, what rules will apply to the UK in the interim and we need an indication of when the sector can expect to adopt the new rules. Industrial production should still make a positive contribution to UK growth in the fourth quarter, despite failing to grow month-on-month in October. That\u2019s the view of Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics, based on the sector\u2019s rolling quarterly performance: Industrial production fell short of the stellar pace indicated by some of the surveys. Indeed, output merely held steady in October and manufacturing output posted only a small 0.1% monthly gain. Nonetheless, this was probably always to be expected after September\u2019s strong monthly rise in both manufacturing and overall production. And the three-month industrial production growth rate remained at a still-strong 1.1%, suggesting that the sector is still on track to provide solid support to growth in Q4. The rise and fall of UK industrial production since before the financial crisis: Industrial production was flat in October, following a 0.7% increase in September. The weak performance was the result of a warmer than usual October according to the Office for National Statistics, because it resulted in a 3.3% fall in energy supply. The ONS explains: Within this sector, gas distribution and supply fell by 7.6%, the warmer than average temperature in October 2017 contributed to this fall. The Met Office reported that the provisional UK mean temperature was 11.3 degrees Celsius, which was 1.8 degrees Celsius above the 1981 to 2010 long-term average. Manufacturing output - the biggest contributor to overall production - managed to scrape growth of just 0.1%. Kate Davies, ONS senior statistician, said the longer-term picture was positive. While manufacturing was relatively subdued overall in October despite record production of cars destined for export, the longer-term picture is one of strong growth. Bitcoin dipped below $15,000, having surged ahead on Thursday. It is currently down 10% at $14,951. Piers Morgan is taking guidance on Bitcoin from veteran investor Warren Buffet: The dollar is on track for its biggest weekly rise in nearly six weeks as optimism grows that Trump\u2019s tax bill will pass. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, is up 0.2% at 93.95. It is up more than 1% over the week, its biggest rise since late October. Reuters explains: US Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill before self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. Passage of the tax bill and strong data would strengthen the case for more US rate increases in the next year, a possibility which bond markets look unprepared for. The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates next week, but futures markets expect less than two rate hikes over the next year. Britain\u2019s manufacturers echo the BCC\u2019s sentiments, with trade body EEF saying there are trickier negotiations ahead: Stephen Phipson, chief executive of EEF: Companies are relieved there is progress in the negotiations. But this is one step forward in a complex and long process. So we need to pin down the transition arrangements, which will be in place after March 2019, to ensure it\u2019s business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality. Many employers will be relieved that their EU employees have more certainty going forward, and government must now clarify the rights of EU citizens by Christmas so that they are not concerned about their future. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed this morning\u2019s breakthrough in Brexit talks, but has warned urgent progress must now be made on a trade deal with the EU, to allow UK businesses to plan for future. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC: Businesses will be breathing a sigh of relief that \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 has been achieved. After the noise and political brinksmanship of recent days, news of a breakthrough in the negotiations will be warmly welcomed by companies across the UK. For business, a swift start to trade talks is crucial to upcoming investment and growth decisions. Companies all across the UK want absolute clarity on the long-term deal being sought, and want government to work closely with business experts to ensure that the details are right. Businesses want answers on what leaving the EU will mean for regulation, customs, hiring, standards, tariffs and taxes. The job of the UK government and the European Commission now is to provide those answers \u2013 and do everything in their power to ensure vibrant cross-border trade between the UK and EU countries can continue. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says the pound is benefiting from the Brexit \u201cfudge\u201d in Brussels: The Brussels fudge that May and Juncker have served up this morning has gone down a treat for sterling. The pound is trading up against almost all major partners, and has reached a six month high against the euro. This morning\u2019s deal looks like a classic eurozone can kicking exercise. It\u2019s now clear that Britain is seeking an agreement on regulatory alignment that will mean the overarching UK wide deal will satisfy Northern Ireland\u2019s requirements. But in the plausible scenario where such a deal is not reached, today\u2019s fudge hinges on Britain coming up with unspecified \u201cspecific solutions\u201d that will avoid a hard border in Ireland. Regardless of any future difficulties, for now the news is very positive, and next week\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit will conclude in celebrations, which the pound has already kicked off this morning. The pound climbed above \u20ac1.15 to the highest level in six months after that crucial agreement on the Irish border, which paves the way to the start of trade talks. The FTSE 100 is roughly flat in early trading, lagging behind its counterparts in the rest of Europe which are all firmly higher this morning after that Brexit breakthrough. The UK\u2019s leading index tends to take a knock from a stronger pound as the listed multinationals make a large proportion of earnings abroad. Here are the scores so far: FTSE 100: +0.04% at 7,323 Germany\u2019s DAX: 0.8% at 13,144 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 5,413 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.9% at 22,669 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 10,333 Europe\u2019s STOXX: +0.7% at 389 For all the latest developments on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, follow our politics live blog: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has received a boost this morning from the news of an overnight breakthrough in Brussels on the Irish border talks. The European Commission said \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made in the first phase of Brexit talks, paving the way for talks to begin on Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. The pound is up 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1482, and up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3517. So traders are not getting too carried away, and rightly so according to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, who cautioned that phase one was the easy part: We all know that breaking up is hard. But breaking up and building a new relationship is harder. Away from Brexit talks, it\u2019s non-farm payrolls day in the US... The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK industrial production and manufacturing output for October 9.30am GMT: Britain\u2019s trade performance in October will be outlined by the ONS 9.30am GMT: UK construction data for October 1pm GMT: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research will publish its estimate of UK growth in the three months to November 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payrolls for November will provide the latest snapshot of employment and earnings in the world\u2019s largest economy",

                "bodyText":"Despite today\u2019s losses on Wall Street, global stock markets had a historic year. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, rose in every single month - the first time ever that shares have avoided a monthly decline. Marketwatch\u2019s Ryan Vlastelica explains: In fact, the index hasn\u2019t had a down month since October 2016. It ended up 0.5% in December, and rose 21.8% over the course of the year. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, credited the strength to improving corporate profitability, tweeting, \u201cWhy have global stocks gone up every month so far this year? Earnings have too (both actual and expected).\u201d And on that note, we really are finished for 2017. Best wishes for the new year, and goodnight! Hello again. After a rollicking year, the US stock market actually ended the final session of 2017 with some small losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to end 2017 at 24,719.22, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 index also dropped 0.5% to close the year at 2,673.61, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.7% to end at 6,903.39. But it was still a very good year for the Dow, which closed at record levels on 71 occasions - itself a record. Hello again. Here\u2019s our news story about the global stock market rally this year: I may pop back later with the Wall Street close, or any other major events. Either way, we wish you all the best for 2018. Happy New Year! GW Amazon\u2019s share price has taken a knock, though, after Donald Trump tweeted that it was getting an unfairly generous deal from the US post service. Here\u2019s the tweet in question: Ding ding! Over in New York, the final trading day of the year is underway. And stocks are moving a little higher - with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 30 points or 0.12%, and the S&amp;P 500 index up 0.16%. 2017 has been a bumper year for America\u2019s stock market, with the Dow surging by 25%m, and the tech-focused Nasdaq up by nearly a third. Technology stocks had a particularly amazing year -- Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all jumped by over 50%, and Apple was close behind. Gold has had its best year since 2010, pushed up by the weaker US dollar. It just hit $1,300 for the first time since mid-October. The FTSE 100 surged by around \u00a3141bn during 2017, according to the London stock exchange. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies, gained around \u00a352bn as it rattled to fresh record highs. That fed into the $9 trillion surge in global share prices during this year (as measured by MSCI) Shares have been a pretty decent investment this year - giving a rather better return than your local bank. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre (a retail stockbroker) says there are reasons why shares could keep rising in 2018. He says: \u201cFor the second year in a row the FTSE100 has ended the year at an all-time high. Personal investors will have been relieved this year by a respite from the high volatility seen in the last couple of years. The level of volatility this year has though been remarkably low by historical standards and this has perhaps meant fewer trading opportunities for those investors who trade more actively. Market commentators have expressed concerns about valuation levels for some time indicating a correction may be on the horizon. However, the market appears to be shrugging off any such concerns and continuing to go from strength to strength. Higher global growth forecasts, a continuation of relatively relaxed monetary policy and a loosening of fiscal policy specifically in the United States are all helping support equities. A personal investor who put money into a FTSE 100 tracker fund at the start of this year will have seen a return of nearly 8% with a dividend payout (yield) of over 3% on top of that. With base rates now at just 0.5% and returns on cash remaining depressed the stark choice for investors seeking to drive an income from their capital is clear and this too helps drive demand for equities and equity based collectives (funds). Mining giants also had a good year, thanks to a boom in commodity prices which saw copper hit a four-year high this week. So, which shares should you have bought a year ago, and which should have come with a health warning? The best-performing share on the FTSE 100 during 2017 was actually a healthcare business based in the the United Arab Emirates, called NMC Health. It jumped by 86% during the year; any traders who backed NMC may be sprinting to the nearest City champagne bar this afternoon.... Second was Worldpay, the payments processor company spun out of the wreckage of Royal Bank of Scotland. It jumped by 57%, thanks to a takeover bid from US rival Vantiv. Housebuilders also had a strong year; Persimmon was the third-best performing member of the Footsie, up 54%, followed by Berkeley Group which gained 49%. But some companies will be glad to see the back of 2017. Centrica slumped by over 40%, partly due to a big profits warning in November, while telecommunications group BT and advertising giant WPP both shank by around a quarter. Breaking! A late burst of buy orders have sent Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index up to a new all-time high. The final trading day of 2017 ended with a flourish, with the FTSE 100 closing up 64 points or 0.85% at 7,687 points. Just before the close, it hit a new intraday high of 7697 points. This means the blue-chip index has gained 7.6% during 2017. With the smaller FTSE 250 index also closing at a new record high, this puts the seal on a good year for the London stock market. But, this still means the Footsie has lagged behind other stock markets - with Japan\u2019s Topix and the US S&amp;P 500 both up around 20% during 2017. Just 10 minutes until the end of the trading year in London, and the FTSE 100 is heading towards a fresh closing high..... World stock markets have surged to a new alltime high today, meaning they\u2019ve put on a blistering $9 trillion in value since the start of January. That\u2019s according to Reuters, which reports: Markets were ending 2017 in a party mood on Friday after a year in which a concerted pick-up in global growth boosted corporate profits and commodity prices, while benign inflation kept central banks from snatching away the monetary punch bowl. MSCI\u2019s world equity index, which tracks 47 countries, inched up 0.15% as six straight weeks and now 13 straight months of gains left it at yet another all time high. The index has been on an upward trajectory for pretty much all of 2017, putting it 22 percent and almost $9 trillion higher for the year. Emerging markets have led the charge with gains of 34%. Hong Kong surged 36%, South Korea notched up 22% and India and Poland both made 27% in local currency terms. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and the S&amp;P 500 are both ahead by almost 20%, while the Dow has risen by a quarter. In Europe, the German DAX has gained nearly 14 %, though the UK FTSE has lagged a little with a rise of 7%. More here: Stocks cheer $9 trillion year, downer for the dollar The euro has enjoyed its best year since 2003, thanks to the recovery in the eurozone economy. The single currency is the best performing G10 currency, according to Bloomberg data: More photos of traders celebrating the last day of trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange in Manila have arrived; it seemed wrong not to share them. Traders have plenty to celebrate -- the main Philippine stock index hit an alltime high this morning, and has gained 25% this year. That helped Asian shares to rack up their best year since 2009 (as discussed earlier). The smaller FTSE 250 index is also at record levels. It rose by 0.25% to 20,695 points, a gain of 55 points this morning. The FTSE 100 is pushing further into record territory, as City investors get their buy orders in before trading closes early at 12.30pm. The blue-chip index has now hit a fresh record high of 7,648 points, up 25 points or 0.3% today. Reuters points out that natural resourse stocks had a stonking year: Miners have been among the FTSE\u2019s best-performing stocks this year, with Antofagasta up 47.4% and Glencore up 40.7% year-to-date. Elsewhere NMC Health has been the index\u2019s best-performing stock, while a takeover has pushed Worldpay\u2019s shares 57 percent higher this year. Housebuilders Persimmon and Berkeley Group have both had a comeback year, recovering after seeing their shares plummet in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum in June 2016. Technology companies have led the rally in Europe this year, mirroring the surge in Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook et al. Miners, banks and industrial companies also had a good year, as this chart shows: Like most financial assets, shares are generally held by richer people (either directly or through pension funds). So the surge in global stock markets this year won\u2019t have helped tackle wealth inequality. The FTSE 100\u2019s 6% rise this year has outpaced inflation (3.1% in December) and wages (up 2.3% during 2017). And the bad news for British workers is that pay growth is likely to lag behind all other wealthy nations in 2018. 2017 hasn\u2019t just been about rising stock markets. Brexit, Donald Trump, food safety, inequality and even a giant, sadly deceased, rabbit called Simon featured in our most popular stories this year. Here\u2019s a round-up of the business news that got you all clicking this year. The strong rally in Asia\u2019s stock markets this year is particularly remarkable, given the geopolitical threat posed by North Korea and the risk that president Trump could trigger a trade war. But instead, traders have shrugged off these worries - sending shares jumping across the region. As CNBC puts it: While geopolitical uncertainty was a major focal point earlier this year \u2014 with several North Korean missile launches initially sending investor scurrying into safe-have assets \u2014 risk appetite has since improved, with markets looking instead to stronger economic growth globally. MSCI\u2019s broad index of shares in Asia Pacific excluding Japan was up more than 34 percent year-to-date on Friday morning. That\u2019s above the roughly 25 percent climb seen on the Dow Jones industrial average and 8 percent rise on the pan-European STOXX 600 over the same period. The London stock market is \u201cdoing its festive best\u201d to reach the New Year at a fresh record high, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Here are the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100, as it hovers around this morning\u2019s peak of 7,636 points. Most global stock markets have enjoyed strong gains this year. Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, said of the 73 bourses it tracks globally, all but nine have recorded gains in local currency terms this year (that\u2019s via Reuters). Japan\u2019s Topix share index has also enjoyed a bumper year; it\u2019s risen by over 19% during 2017. Traders held a ceremony to mark the end of the trading year, and invited Go champion Yuta Iyama to ring the closing bell. European stock markets are on track to record their best year since 2013. The Stoxx 600 index has just opened flat, leaving it on track for a near-8% gain over the last 12 months. The pound is also having a good morning. It\u2019s up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.35, a three-week high. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new record at the start of trading. The blue-chip index has jumped by 13 points to 7,636, slightly over yesterday\u2019s record high. It means the Footsie has risen by 4.5% during December - a month that saw Britain agree the first phase of a Brexit deal with Brussels. Just Eat, the fast food-ordering app company, is leading the risers, up 1.8%. It only joined the FTSE 100 this month, after seeing its value overtake the likes of supermarket chain J Sainsbury. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the final day of the trading year, and what a year it\u2019s been for investors. Stocks have surged world wide over the last 12 months - thanks to renewed confidence in the global economy and a steady drip-drip-drip of monetary stimulus from central bankers. Over in Asia, the markets have enjoyed their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which tracks stocks across the region, has surged by almost 29% this year. Hong Kong has enjoyed a particularly exuberant year - jumping by an sparkling 36%, while South Korea posted a 22% gain and India jumped by 27%. Ceremonies have already been taking place at stock markets across Asia, including in Tokyo and Manila. Many commodities have strengthened this year too, at the expense of the weaker US dollar. Donald Trump\u2019s push for tax cuts has not made the greenback great again. In Europe, many stock markets are already sitting on double-digit gains - Germany\u2019s DAX, for example, is up 13%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit fresh record highs this week, but has actually only gained around 6.7% during the year. Today\u2019s trading session will end at 12.30pm. So, a solid year for shares. But could the markets be peaking? Some investors worry that the good times could end soon. For example, an index from State Street that tracks investor risk appetite suffered its six straight monthly fall in December. As Michael Metcalfe, State Street\u2019s head of global macro strategy, put it: \u201cWhile the broader economic outlook appears increasingly rosy, as captured by measures of consumer and business confidence, the more cautious nature of investors hints at a concern that markets may have already discounted much of the good news.\u201d There\u2019s not much in the agenda (understandably), apart from new inflation figures from Germany.",
