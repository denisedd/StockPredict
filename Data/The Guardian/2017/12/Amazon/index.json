                "bodyText":"Shares on Wall Street have hit record levels as financial markets around the world anticipate the biggest package of US tax cuts since Ronald Reagan was in the White House in the 1980s. Investors bought heavily into US stocks after Donald Trump received approval from the Senate for reforms that offer the biggest reduction in taxes to corporations and those on high incomes. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 hit record levels in early trading but later fell back because of a sell-off of technology stocks, which have seen substantial price rises this year. But there was heavy buying of telecom, bank, financial and other shares in sectors seen as benefiting from the tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy. The technology sector is expected to benefit less because it already enjoys low tax rates. Although the final details of the package have still to be finalised through an agreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives, Wall Street believes that the president has finally succeeded in a near year-long battle to get Congress to support his plan.

                "bodyText":"So, not the most convincing rally we\u2019ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we\u2019ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to \u2018sell the news\u2019 and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn\u2019t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we\u2019ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That\u2019s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s stock market rally. It\u2019s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here\u2019s Nils\u2019 column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren\u2019t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal\u2019s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It\u2019s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn\u2019t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May\u2019s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today\u2019s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \u201cGetting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn\u2019t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there\u2019s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here\u2019s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \u201cI think this bill is very dangerous,\u201d he said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program. \u201cWhen people lose health insurance, they\u2019re less likely to get preventive care, they\u2019re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they\u2019re more likely to die.\u201d Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county\u2019s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \u201cit was exceptional\u201d it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the \u20ac86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate\u2019s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let\u2019s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump\u2019s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump\u2019s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There\u2019s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate\u2019s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That\u2019d leave the Dow at \u2013 what else \u2013 a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday\u2019s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it\u2019s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country\u2019s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth \u20ac5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today \u2013 less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \u201cAlthough a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\u201d It\u2019s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 \u2018prior actions\u2019 or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures \u2013 a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone \u2013 is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the \u20ac86bn bailout programme, the country\u2019s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain\u2019s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it\u2019s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at \u20ac1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \u201cfar-reaching implications\u201d. But it\u2019s not clear that Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they\u2019re currently propping up Theresa May\u2019s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reforms\u2019 is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland\u2019s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That\u2019s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America\u2019s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate\u2019s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump\u2019s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market\u2019s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \u201cAfter the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \u201cResidential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u201cOn the frontline we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK\u2019s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite \u2018brittle, adding: \u201cAnecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain\u2019s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit\u2019s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain\u2019s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October\u2019s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October\u2019s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \u201cUK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \u201cConstruction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump\u2019s push to cut America\u2019s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies\u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft\u2013currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech\u2019s Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe\u2019s stock markets are recovering from Friday\u2019s shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cEuropean markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend\u2019s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump\u2019s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate\u2019s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President\u2019s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump\u2019s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president\u2019s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \u201cvery, very happy\u2019. But...the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d plan to cut taxes for \u201caverage Americans\u201d has been criticised by experts who say it\u2019s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \u201cIn the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \u201cEvery time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\u201d But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven\u2019t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u201cthere is still a way to go\u201d to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures. Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report 3pm GMT: US factory orders for October",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u2019s trade secretary, Liam Fox, will be a star of this week\u2019s meeting in Buenos Aires of the World Trade Organisation. This won\u2019t be for anything he has to say so much as for being the representative of the UK as it nears the European Union\u2019s exit door. Most economists expect that a hard Brexit \u2013 which Fox prefers to a deal that keeps the UK entwined with EU institutions \u2013 would damage global trade. A soft Brexit is expected to be a modest blow. This might not matter had global trade not been going through a rough patch over the past couple of years. In 2014 and 2015 it slumped as foreign investment slowed, developed nations rowed back on outsourcing, sanctions on Russia bit and Brazil\u2019s corruption scandals hit some of the country\u2019s biggest businesses. This year is proving to be much better with the International Monetary Fund forecasting growth of 3.7% and the investment bank ING saying it will be more like 4.2%, up from its measure of below 2% last year. Next year, though, is likely to see a slowing again as China seeks to source more services internally, offsetting a return to more buoyant trade figures from Russia, Brazil and the US. Fox, though, says he is in the Argentinian capital to talk about rules governing the export of digital services and information without costly customs duties and to make domestic regulations in other countries more transparent for the UK\u2019s small and medium-sized businesses. On these points he is considered by anti-poverty campaigners and developing world nations to be just another mouthpiece for big corporations. Google, Amazon and Facebook are desperate to open the doors of nervous developing world countries and gain access to the information held on their citizens. Fox and his colleagues in the G7, believing they have lost the race for domination in the trade of goods, want to make sure the digital services revolution remains firmly in their hands.

As a way of stopping another Seattle, where anti-globalisation activists rioted for two days in 1999, the president\u2019s actions have cut off protest at the source. But as an advert for the benefits of global trade and globalisation, it reveals a nervousness that appears to make protest more than justified.

The company\u2019s portfolio of 35 centres includes sites in Italy, the US and Australia. Unibail runs 69 shopping centres in 11 EU countries but lacks a UK or US presence. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said: \u201cThe deal would plug the last remaining holes in Unibail-Rodamco\u2019s European dominant positioning \u2013 now also UK and Italy \u2013 and give the group access to a high-quality portfolio in the US.\u201d Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at the retail consultancy GlobalData said the Westfield takeover would enable Unibail to benefit from expected growth of 7.2% in the UK super-mall market over the next five years to \u00a312.3bn. \u201cWith consumers favouring destination shopping locations which appeal to shoppers\u2019 desire for a social and lifestyle experience, and Westfield setting the bar in terms of focus on overall experience, this is a beneficial move,\u201d she said. Both company boards unanimously recommended the deal. Frank Lowy, the Westfield chairman and co-founder, recently received a knighthood. He and his co-chief executive sons, Steven and Peter, will step down, but Lowy will chair an advisory board for the new company. The Westfield business empire grew out of a delicatessen and later a shopping centre founded in Sydney in the 1950s by Lowy, now one of Australia\u2019s richest men, and the late John Saunders, both immigrants from Hungary who survived the Holocaust.

Like-for-like sales in the half-year to the end of October improved 7%. At Carphone, however, the formula looks broken.</p> <p>Sebastian James, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, didn\u2019t put it quite like that, but it was the implication of his vague promise \u201cto adapt our model in order to cement our place in a changing world\u201d. What\u2019s he actually going to do? Come back in 2018 to find out, but the problem plainly requires something more radical that simply shutting a few stores.</p> <p>In Carphone\u2019s glory days, customers were happy to sign two- or three-year deals where the cost of the handset was spread across the life of a contract that also included a data allowance. These days, more of us know exactly which handset we want, then we lease it and then we buy a separate data package. The net effect is that pricing has become more transparent, which spells bad news for the retailer in the middle.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that we can, over time, reduce the complexity and capital intensity of our mobile business model, and increase the simplicity and profitability of what we do,\u201d said James. Well, maybe, but the other problem is that people are upgrading their phones less often because the top models cost almost \u00a31,000. That factor is outside Carphone\u2019s control.</p> <p>For the time being, the promise to reform Carphone satisfied the City. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/13/dixons-carphone-warns-of-store-closures-as-profits-plummet-by-60\">Group half-year profits plunged to \u00a361m</a> but the prediction of \u00a3360m-\u00a3400m for the full year was no worse than signalled in August\u2019s warning. Shares rose 8%.</p> <p>Take a step back, though, and they have fallen 45% since the all-share merger. Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone who owns 11.6% of the combined beast, obviously won\u2019t be happy, but he should be grateful for small mercies. If he hadn\u2019t diluted his Carphone exposure with a helping of Dixons\u2019 business, his position would be worse.</p> <h2>Ofwat\u2019s transparent problem<br></h2> <p>Water regulator Ofwat always describes its five-yearly price reviews as \u201ctough\u201d on the privatised utilities \u2013 it would be a laughing stock if it said it was being soft \u2013 but this time it has a tangible boast. It has used an average cost of capital for the companies of 2.4%, which it says would be a record low for regulated utilities. As a result, customers\u2019 bills should fall by \u00a315-\u00a325 a year from 2020 to 2025.</p> <p>Jolly good, but you\u2019ll struggle to find hard evidence in the dense document that Ofwat is delivering on its other promise to get tough on opaque financing structures that baffle customers.</p> <p>Ofwat chairman Jonson Cox clearly understands the importance of the issue. \u201cIn using financial engineering to increase debt and pay high returns to investors, a small handful of companies have led the public to question whether these structures are fit for public service assets,\u201d he wrote in the Times this week. But where\u2019s the bite?</p> <p>Ofwat\u2019s approach is mostly to prod and cajole, and seek \u201cassurances\u201d about transparency. It has had some success, it might be said, since Thames Water and Yorkshire Water have pledged to dismantle their Cayman Islands subsidiaries. But those corporate rejigs surely owe more to Labour\u2019s nationalisation drum beat. Why is it so hard for Ofwat to define exactly what counts as useful disclosure and to set out the penalties for non-compliance?</p> <h2>Bank of England goes all PC<br></h2> <p>Here\u2019s news to upset the usual suspects: the Bank of England is going more PC than the bleedin\u2019 Guardian in its removal of gendered language.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street will amend titles in its rulebook that refer to the \u201cchairman\u201d and use \u201cchair\u201d instead. By contrast, \u201cchair\u201d is merely deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d in place of chairman or chairwoman in this paper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-c\">style guide</a>. References to individuals\u2019 roles will become \u201chis/her\u201d at the Bank and \u201cgrandfathering\u201d rights \u2013 describing exclusions from new rules, for example \u2013 will become \u201cconversion\u201d rights.</p> <p>It all sounds sensible. Many public bodies made the switch years ago. The sky will not fall in. </p> <p>But before applauding too loudly, let\u2019s just check the makeup of the Bank\u2019s two most important committees. The financial policy committee comprises 12 men and no women. On the monetary policy committee, the score is 8-1, with no prizes for guessing the he/she arrangement.</p>",

What\u2019s he actually going to do? Come back in 2018 to find out, but the problem plainly requires something more radical that simply shutting a few stores. In Carphone\u2019s glory days, customers were happy to sign two- or three-year deals where the cost of the handset was spread across the life of a contract that also included a data allowance. These days, more of us know exactly which handset we want, then we lease it and then we buy a separate data package. The net effect is that pricing has become more transparent, which spells bad news for the retailer in the middle. \u201cWe believe that we can, over time, reduce the complexity and capital intensity of our mobile business model, and increase the simplicity and profitability of what we do,\u201d said James. Well, maybe, but the other problem is that people are upgrading their phones less often because the top models cost almost \u00a31,000. That factor is outside Carphone\u2019s control. For the time being, the promise to reform Carphone satisfied the City. Group half-year profits plunged to \u00a361m but the prediction of \u00a3360m-\u00a3400m for the full year was no worse than signalled in August\u2019s warning. Shares rose 8%. Take a step back, though, and they have fallen 45% since the all-share merger. Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone who owns 11.6% of the combined beast, obviously won\u2019t be happy, but he should be grateful for small mercies. If he hadn\u2019t diluted his Carphone exposure with a helping of Dixons\u2019 business, his position would be worse. Ofwat\u2019s transparent problem Water regulator Ofwat always describes its five-yearly price reviews as \u201ctough\u201d on the privatised utilities \u2013 it would be a laughing stock if it said it was being soft \u2013 but this time it has a tangible boast. It has used an average cost of capital for the companies of 2.4%, which it says would be a record low for regulated utilities. As a result, customers\u2019 bills should fall by \u00a315-\u00a325 a year from 2020 to 2025. Jolly good, but you\u2019ll struggle to find hard evidence in the dense document that Ofwat is delivering on its other promise to get tough on opaque financing structures that baffle customers. Ofwat chairman Jonson Cox clearly understands the importance of the issue. \u201cIn using financial engineering to increase debt and pay high returns to investors, a small handful of companies have led the public to question whether these structures are fit for public service assets,\u201d he wrote in the Times this week. But where\u2019s the bite? Ofwat\u2019s approach is mostly to prod and cajole, and seek \u201cassurances\u201d about transparency. It has had some success, it might be said, since Thames Water and Yorkshire Water have pledged to dismantle their Cayman Islands subsidiaries. But those corporate rejigs surely owe more to Labour\u2019s nationalisation drum beat. Why is it so hard for Ofwat to define exactly what counts as useful disclosure and to set out the penalties for non-compliance? Bank of England goes all PC Here\u2019s news to upset the usual suspects: the Bank of England is going more PC than the bleedin\u2019 Guardian in its removal of gendered language. Threadneedle Street will amend titles in its rulebook that refer to the \u201cchairman\u201d and use \u201cchair\u201d instead. By contrast, \u201cchair\u201d is merely deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d in place of chairman or chairwoman in this paper\u2019s style guide. References to individuals\u2019 roles will become \u201chis/her\u201d at the Bank and \u201cgrandfathering\u201d rights \u2013 describing exclusions from new rules, for example \u2013 will become \u201cconversion\u201d rights. It all sounds sensible. Many public bodies made the switch years ago. The sky will not fall in. But before applauding too loudly, let\u2019s just check the makeup of the Bank\u2019s two most important committees. The financial policy committee comprises 12 men and no women. On the monetary policy committee, the score is 8-1, with no prizes for guessing the he/she arrangement.",

It means Sky customers will be able to watch BT channels with sport, including Champions League, Premiership rugby and Premier League matches it does not currently air without a separate subscription. The deal will give BT TV a much needed boost \u2013 new quarterly subscriber numbers have dropped to record low of about 8,000 \u2013 with prime Sky content including all Premier League football matches to be made available. BT subscribers will also get access to Sky Atlantic, which airs programmes such as Game of Thrones, Billions, Riviera and Fortitude. They will also get Sky\u2019s entertainment channels including Sky Living, Sky One and Sky Cinema by adding the Now TV streaming service to BT set top boxes from 2019. BT will sell Now TV subscription passes, which allows customers to watch Sky programmes without a monthly subscription. BT and Sky have been at loggerheads for years over the issue of channel carriage, most acrimoniously over access to Sky\u2019s prime sports channels which had been the subject of a protracted legal battle which BT lost. BT stands to gain the most from the deal, with just 1.7 million TV customers and anaemic growth it needed to supercharge its content. Sky will gain access to pay-TV fans. Analysts believe it could affect the scale of bidding when the Premier League TV rights auction begins in February. The channel deals mean that Sky and BT customers can gain access to all Premier League matches without being forced to choose to buy TV packages from either or both. Analysts believe this could mean the fear of missing out on the best games package in the auction \u2013 which has spurred rampant price inflation in recent bidding \u2013 could recede. \u201cThis could mean that BT and Sky can take their foot off the accelerator,\u201d Richard Broughton, of Ampere Analysis, said. \u201cThe cost to either BT or Sky of \u2018no access\u2019 to games has massively reduced, so they may not feel they need to bid as competitively. Of course there is the big unknown of whether a new bidder, like Amazon, might enter the auction.\u201d BT and Sky had paid more than \u00a35bn for Premier League rights last time, with costs rising 70% at each of the last two auctions. Bosses of both companies had complained about the high cost for sports rights. City analysts believe inflation could hit 40% this auction, although pay-TV company sources predict a 23% hike. \u201cThis is an important day for BT and for our customers,\u201d said Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT. \u201cWe feel that now is the right time to broaden the ways we distribute BT Sport.\u201d The chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, said: \u201cThis is great news for Sky customers who will be able to access all matches on Sky and BT channels from the Premier League, Champions League and Europa League directly with a single Sky TV subscription.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

But as we have argued above, we doubt whether Bitcoin itself has what it takes to become a serious mainstream payment systems contender. Instead, we think it is more likely for Bitcoin to return to its roots as a niche payment system. A niche asset adopted worldwide could still have a substantial user base and hence value.

Governments and regulators may never come to like decentralised financial networks at all. A negative event, such as a price crash followed by public outcry, could trigger a regulatory crackdown.<br></li> <li><strong>Intermediaries: </strong>Working without intermediaries is cherished by a core group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The mass audience however dislikes having no rights, no recourse, no guarantees, no legal coverage, nothing. They just want secure, reliable and hassle-free access to their money, and a help desk to call when they lose their password.<br></li> <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>The Bitcoin network is currently clogged and the current level of transaction fees (average $8 in November) makes it very unattractive for small payments.<br></li> <li><strong>Volatility: </strong>while the value of \u201cordinary\u201d money is managed by the central bank, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is fixed and its value depends greatly on demand.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Bitcoin has made a subdued debut onto the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, as a series of politicians and officials voiced concerns about the digital currency. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) became the second exchange to offer bitcoin derivatives trading last night. And right now, bitcoin futures contracts which settle in 2018 have all fallen below their opening value. The January 2018 contract, which initially spiked over $20,000, has now dropped back to $18,920 - having been originally priced at $19,500. Contracts that mature in February, March and June are all in the red (although they\u2019ve received little attention compared to the January option). Futures contracts allow traders to bet against an asset, so today\u2019s moves could suggest that bitcoin\u2019s stunning rally is running out of steam. But, less than 1,000 contracts have been traded today (each one is worth 5 bitcoins). The spot price of bitcoin has also dipped, currently down 1.6% at $18,640 - having hit a new alltime high near $20,000 last night. CME\u2019s launch of bitcoin futures was accompanied by a series of warnings. For example: Denmark\u2019s top central banker said bitcoin was dangerous, and investors shouldn\u2019t blame regulators if they lost their money. A senior Singaporean regulator said bitcoin had no intrinsic value France\u2019s finance minister is pushing for the G20 to debate bitcoin regulation UBS\u2019s chairmen, Axel Weber, said regulators should take a closer look at digital currencies Analysts at ING also put the boot into bitcoin, saying it would eventually become just a \u2018niche product\u2019 again. ING cited bitcoin\u2019s volatility, scalability issues, and the shadow of regulation among several reasons why it would not replace traditional cash. So those buyers who are hoping to sell their bitcoins at an even higher price in the future may be disappointed, they say: We are enthusiastic about blockchain technology, and the current attention for Bitcoin could boost blockchain and digital currencies\u2019 development. But as we have argued above, we doubt whether Bitcoin itself has what it takes to become a serious mainstream payment systems contender. Instead, we think it is more likely for Bitcoin to return to its roots as a niche payment system. A niche asset adopted worldwide could still have a substantial user base and hence value. It is therefore impossible to say whether the current Bitcoin market price is \u201ctoo high\u201d for a niche asset. Then again, we join the crowd of analysts observing typical bubble characteristics: the idea of an asset that is new, revolutionary, almost magic \u2013 hard to understand, but let\u2019s invest anyway because it will become huge. This idea is a form of \u201cthis time it\u2019s different\u201d-thinking. \u201cYes we know about all those previous bubbles that popped, but Bitcoin is really, really different.\u201d We are not so sure. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our news story about the kerfuffle over Ikea\u2019s tax affairs: European stock markets have closed at their highest level in almost six weeks, following Wall Street\u2019s lead. The German Dax led the charge, gaining 1.6%, with France\u2019s CAC and the Italian FTSE MIB both gaining 1.33%. The UK lagged behind, with the FTSE 100 finishing 46 points higher at 7,537, up 0.6%. The Footsie was held back by the pound, which has gained almost a cent today to $1.34 (which is bad for exporters). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the City is anticipating a final deal on US tax cuts soon. Risk on sentiment is driving trading, as investor optimism over the US tax bill being passed sooner rather than later is lifting stocks. The 2 wavering Senators, which could have thrown the vote in the Senate slim majority are now back on side and the markets are cheering. France\u2019s call for G20 leaders to debate bitcoin regulation may win the support of Germany. Bloomberg reports: In Berlin, a Finance Ministry spokesman said it was watching \u201cbitcoin and other cryptocurrency developments closely,\u201d adding that Germany\u2019s financial supervisor Bafin has already warned of the risks of cryptocurrencies for consumers. In Greece leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has urged banks to do more to clamp down on big time debtors, citing the banking system\u2019s record stock of non-performing loans. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a no-holds barred speech Tsipras told leading bankers today that the time had come to crack down on big-time debtors and strategic defaulters as part of efforts to restore liquidity to Greece\u2019s cash-strapped economy. Those who had allowed bad debt to bust businesses, but done well themselves, had to be \u201cchased,\u201d he told bank representatives assembled at his office, adding: \u201cLiquidity needs to be restored to the economy \u2026 We need a responsible and effective way to deal with the problem of non-performing loans.\u201d By failing to effectively deal with NPLs \u2013 of which Greece has the highest amount in the EU \u2013 and provide funding for others, he said, banks were failing to properly support young Greeks in fulfilling their dreams. Describing the role of banks as crucial, the leftist leader also called for the creation of an \u201cobservatory\u201d that could advise the government on what banks could offer. With less than a year before the debt-stricken country\u2019s third international bailout officially expires \u2013 ending, it is hoped, an era of international supervision \u2013 the government is keen to improve daily life. On Friday the International Monetary Fund also cited bad debt as a major obstacle for Cypriot banks despite the island\u2019s impressive economic recovery after its own crisis in 2013. NPLs in Cypriot banks amount to 46% of loans -- after Greece the highest amount in the EU. Maybe some of these bubble warnings are getting through to investors. The bitcoin futures price is now moving south, as more traders take a position via CME\u2019s new derivatives platform. Almost 840 contracts for the January 2018 bitcoin contract have now been traded - with the price now falling to $19,010 [reminder, each contract is for five bitcoins]. Over in New York, the US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 138 points, or 0.5%, to 24,790 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also up, while rallying tech stocks have sent the Nasdaq higher too. Investors are excited by the possibility that the US Congress might reach a final agreement on tax reforms. Those reforms have been heavily criticised by some experts, who fear it will drive up the US deficit and hand the richest Americans a tax cut. So why is Wall Street celebrating? Because the bill will slash corporation tax, delivering a massive windfall to large corporations. Analysts at FxPro say: With the bill reducing corporation tax from 35% to 21%, there will be a windfall to US companies. With the possibility of share buy-backs and/or higher dividends by US Corporations, this will, in turn, increase the pace of interest rate hikes and see a stronger US dollar as a result. But.... foreign exchange expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale points out that bond traders aren\u2019t impressed by the tax reforms: The US Tax Bill will probably be voted on, pass and will turn up on the President\u2019s desk this week . A significant boost to the economy? \u201cOh yes, it is\u201d cries President Trump, who calls it \u2018one of the great Christmas gifts\u2019 to the middle class. \u201cOh no, it isn\u2019t\u201d answers the bond market, as 10yr Notes meander along at 2.37% this morning, and TIPS remain mid-range. The bond market fell for the President\u2019s policy promises this time last year and is resolutely unimpressed this time round. \u2018Bah, Humbug\u2019 sums it up (at the risk of mixing panto-metaphors). Denmark\u2019s top central banker has now issued a stern warning to speculators to avoid bitcoin. Lars Rohde, governor of the National Bank of Denmark, told local broadcaster DR that bitcoin was a dangerous bubble, comparing it to the tulip bulb mania of the 17th Century. Rohde declared that putting money into bitcoin was basically gambling, warning: \u201cYou have to stay away [from bitcoin]. It is dangerous. Rohde also warned that people buying bitcoin shouldn\u2019t blame regulators if they suffer losses when the market crashes. He says: \u201cIt is not a regulated market. It is not the responsibility of the authorities. It is the responsibility of the individual.\u201d So far so smooth for bitcoin today..... Don\u2019t risk the scrum of present-hunters in the shops this lunchtime. Instead, pit your wits against our Christmas quiz.... Breaking away from Bitcoin.... and the European Union has launched an investigation into whether Ikea is unfairly dodging tax. The EU has opened an in-depth investigation into the Swedish furniture giant\u2019s tax deals in the Netherlands, and whether it used a Dutch subsidiary to slash its tax bill. EU\u2019s anti-trust commissioner Margrethe Vestager is concerned that Ikea may have had an unfair advantage over rivals, by using various subsidiaries to reduce its tax burden. She says: \u201cAll companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax. \u201cMember states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere.\u201d The inquiry focuses on two tax rulings in the Netherlands. One allowed Inter Ikea, its Dutch branch, to pay a large licence fee to a Luxembourg-based division which paid less tax. A second ruling involved a loan arrangement between Inter Ikea and a unit in Liechtenstein, which also moved shifted taxable revenue to a low tax jurisdiction. Most of the EU\u2019s previous tax inquiries have focused on US companies, as Apple and Amazon. This one is closer to home, points out Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit. We should note that CME\u2019s new bitcoin futures contracts actually covers five units of the digital currency. So the 681 contracts traded so far today have a notional value of 3,405 bitcoins -- or around $65m. Singapore\u2019s financial watchdog has joined the chorus of concerns over cryptocurrencies. Sopnendu Mohanty, the top fintech official at Singapore\u2019s monetary authority (MAS), has warned that people who have invested in bitcoin will come a cropper when they try to withdraw their funds. The Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has the story: Bitcoin has no fundamental value and is likely to end in tears once speculators discover how hard it can be to extricate their cash, Singapore\u2019s financial watchdog has warned. Sopnendu Mohanty, Fintech chief for Singapore\u2019s monetary authority (MAS), said there was a crucial difference between Bitcoin and rival crypto-currency Ethereum, but it is far from clear whether either improves day-to-day transactions or has much potential as a tool for central banking. \u201cBitcoin has no natural intrinsic value. Can you buy a house with it? Can you use it for daily interactions? It may be valued at $18,000 right now but what I want to know is how you convert it into fiat currency and realize that value. The risk comes at the moment of conversion,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph.... More here: Singapore\u2019s Fintech chief warns on Bitcoin delusion The bitcoin futures price is also rallying. The January contract has now jumped back to $19,645, over the opening price of $19,500, and ahead of today\u2019s \u2018spot price\u2019. But the trading volume is still quite modest, with exactly 666 contracts so far on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u2019s new offering. Other longer-dated bitcoin futures contracts are also available, but are being ignored - just seven have been traded so far. I guess that betting where bitcoin\u2019s price in June 2018 is too risky even for seasoned traders... Bitcoin is creeping higher again, as early bird traders head to their desks in America. The spot price has jumped back over $19,000, erasing this morning\u2019s small dip as CME\u2019s futures trading got under way. Swissquote Bank, an online bank based in Switzerland, has a more positive view of bitcoin than UBS. It has been letting customers buy bitcoin since July, and today it added four other digital currencies - Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin and Ripple Analyst Yann Quelenn argues that bitcoin\u2019s scarcity (there can only ever be 21 million coins, with 16m discovered so far) will help push its price higher. Quelenn says: Who would have thought at the start of 2017 that Bitcoin would increase 20-fold? That was simply unpredictable. The introduction of futures trading has driven up prices. Nonetheless, it is also artificially increasing supply and weighing on prices. In the short-run, Bitcoin is likely to reach US$ 25,000. A correction is due at some point, but within the next few years it should easily reach US$ 100,000. By the way: Bitcoin is far from perfect, with high transaction fees and low scalability. And it is expensive, but it is even more scarce. Newsflash: British manufacturers are ending 2017 on a high, with the strongest order books in 30 years. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck on UK factories, which found that exports and total output are both strong. The survey found that: 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +17% (joint highest with last month and August 1988) 28% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 12% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +16% well above the long-run average of -18% 42% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 11% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +30% above the long-run average of +4% The slump in the pound after last year\u2019s Brexit vote should have made UK exports more competitive. But...it also means that imported raw materials are more expensive. That is likely to translate into higher prices in the shops in the months ahead. Correction corner: I daftly called UBS a German bank earlier. It\u2019s Swiss, of course (the name dates back to Union Bank of Switzerland) Thanks to the readers who kindly flagged it up. Update: Bitcoin is still hovering around the $18,800 mark, having dropped back from nearly $20,000 overnight. The future price of Bitcoin is also quite stable on CME\u2019s platform. Just over 650 contracts for bitcoin\u2019s value in January 2018 have now been traded since last night. Right now, that contract is priced at $19,330, down from the opening price of $19,500. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the introduction of futures contracts is having a slight negative impact on the bitcoin price. This negative impact from CME futures on Bitcoin is likely temporary, just like it was with the launch of CBOE futures last week. Until the bulk of the volume of trading is done through futures, spot prices should dictate the futures price, not vice versa. Bitcoin is a rubbish investment, literally! An email just popped into my inbox, announcing that you can use digital currencies to pay to have your company\u2019s waste and recycling hauled away. York-based BusinessWaste.co.uk will now accept bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum - along with dusty old cash and credit cards. They insist it isn\u2019t a publicity stunt (perish the very thought!), but a natural response to customer demand... Business Waste spokesperson Mark Hall argues: \u201cIndividuals and companies are trading in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies all over the world. So of course we\u2019re going to accept it from our customers.\u201d Here\u2019s some Twitter reaction: Dutch Bank ING shares some of Axel Weber\u2019s concerns over bitcoin. In a new research note, ING argue that the digital currency will eventually return to being a \u201cniche product for a select group of enthusiasts\u201d, rather than a revolutionary new currency that reshapes the financial system. Why? They argue that there are several impediments build into bitcoin, which will prevent it becoming the peer-to-peer electronic cash system envisioned by creator Satoshi Nakamoto. For example: Regulation: Its decentralised nature makes it difficult to regulate. Governments and regulators may never come to like decentralised financial networks at all. A negative event, such as a price crash followed by public outcry, could trigger a regulatory crackdown. Intermediaries: Working without intermediaries is cherished by a core group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The mass audience however dislikes having no rights, no recourse, no guarantees, no legal coverage, nothing. They just want secure, reliable and hassle-free access to their money, and a help desk to call when they lose their password. Scalability: The Bitcoin network is currently clogged and the current level of transaction fees (average $8 in November) makes it very unattractive for small payments. Volatility: while the value of \u201cordinary\u201d money is managed by the central bank, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is fixed and its value depends greatly on demand. This makes it inherently volatile. Energy use: in the case of Bitcoin, the price of taking out intermediaries is very high electricity consumption. Governance: Blockchain is great at rule enforcement, but does not provide at all for rule-setting. This lack of governance makes implementing innovations slow and painful. Moreover, power may get concentrated in the hands of a few (miners, in the case of Bitcoin). The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: France\u2019s finance minister, Brune Le Maire, has also waded into the bitcoin debate. He wants the G20 group of leading advanced economies to debate the whole issue of digital currencies next speing. Speaking on French news channel LCI, Le Maire says: \u201cI am going to propose to the next G20 president, Argentina, that at the G20 summit in April we have a discussion all together on the question of bitcoin.\u201d Le Maire told French news channel LCI. \u201cThere is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how (...) with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin.\u201d But..... can the G20 really do much about bitcoin? They can certainly try to clamp down on criminals who use anonymous decentralised currencies to launder money. But beyond that, it gets tricky. Bitcoin isn\u2019t an official currency, so it doesn\u2019t fall under the control of a central bank. So should it be regulated as a security - a financial asset? Possibly. Back in July, America\u2019s Security and Exchange Commission ruled that Initial Coin Offerings \u2013 where a new digital currency is launched and sold to investors \u2013 meet some of the criteria. That opens up to prospect of ICOs being scrutinised by regulators. But even that wouldn\u2019t extend to interfering with day-to-day prices. The FT have published a good take on the battle between the two rival Chicago-based financial exchanges to offer bitcoin derivatives. Here\u2019s a flavour: The bitcoin futures race began in earnest on Sunday as exchange operator CME Group challenged another Chicago exchange that had launched the first digital-currency futures a week before. In the first three hours of trading, nearly $50m in bitcoin futures changed hands on CME, the world\u2019s biggest exchange operator by market value. Rival Cboe Global Markets had hosted $30m in bitcoin futures trading over the same time. The two Chicago-based exchanges created competing bitcoin futures contracts as prices flew higher and professional investors sought exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange. Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME. Investors will closely watch how CME\u2019s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world\u2019s most-liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities. Futures listings tend to be a winner-takes-all business. More here: Duelling bitcoin futures go head-to-head as CME launches contract The launch of bitcoin futures contracts has two significant implications. Firstly, it makes it easier for institutional investors to take a position in bitcoin. They don\u2019t have to actually buy and sell digital currencies, let alone mine them by cracking complicated maths problems. Instead, they just take a position and profit, or lose money, when the contract expires, based on CME\u2019s index of bitcoin prices across several exchanges. Secondly, it allows people to bet against bitcoin. Until now, there hasn\u2019t really been any way of wagering that digital currencies are overpriced. Derivatives contracts allow a trader to bet that bitcoin will be worth less than the current price in, say, mid-January (or whenever a particular futures contract expires). That should mean that digital currencies find their \u2018true\u2019 value, stripping out some of the recent volatility. That\u2019s the theory, anyway. It may not go as smoothy in practice, as Lee Wild of interactive investor explains: Introducing futures contracts in the US was meant to give short-sellers access to the market and improve liquidity, but availability is still fairly restricted. The introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the weekend may help, but it will take time. Until it becomes easier to sell short, buying dries up, or there are tech issues or a major hack, bitcoin will keep passing milestones with alarming regularity. Right now, there\u2019s a long queue of investors, both amateur and professional, still waiting for a ride. This bubble is not bursting yet.\u201d CNN Money reckons the bitcoin bandwagon \u201cjust keeps rolling on\u201d, with the launch of futures trading on CME. They say: The involvement of top financial institutions in the bitcoin market underscores its growing mainstream acceptance even as government officials, business leaders and economists continue to warn people against investing in it. The CME launch \u201cadds considerable legitimacy\u201d to bitcoin trading, said Shane Chanel, an adviser at Australian investment services firm ASR Wealth Advisers. Swiss bank UBS has warned anyone keen to invest in bitcoin that they risk losing their money. UBS chairman Axel Weber fears that the digital currency\u2019s recent gains are unsustainable, and says investors and speculators should keep away. Speaking to Swiss newspaper NZZ, he says: \u201cWe as a bank have consciously warned against this product because we do not assess it to be valuable or sustainable.\u201d Weber argues that financial regulators should now step in, given the surge of interest in bitcoin recently. Otherwise, he fears smaller investors could be wiped out by bitcoin\u2019s volatility. As Weber puts it: \u201cAs soon as small investors invest, the regulators are required.... I would welcome an discussion with regulators about cryptocurrencies. There are already signs that governments are taking more interest in bitcoin, with European officials concerned that it is being used for moneylaundering. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of finance, or an unsustainable speculative bubble that will cost investors their shirts? The jury is still out on Bitcoin. What we do know, though, is that the cryptocurrency has crossed another barrier -- the world\u2019s biggest exchange is now offering bitcoin futures. From today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is allowing investors to wager whether they think bitcoin will rise or fall in value in the months ahead (after seeing it surge around 2,000% this year). CME is the second exchange to offer bitcoin futures \u2013 rival Cboe stole a march last week \u2013 and this move shows how digital currencies have pushed their way into the mainstream. The launch has gone fairly smoothly so far. The \u2018spot price\u2019 of bitcoin initially surged to almost $20,000, a new record, before dipping back towards $18,800 by 8am London time. Such volatility shows why sceptics argue that bitcoin is hardly a reliable store of value, mind you. Over on CME, the January 2018 futures price has actually dropped a little in the first few hours of trading. It was priced at $19,500, but is now changing hands at $19,370. That suggests that investors expect bitcoin to broadly hold its value over the next month. Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, told Reuters that many traders are approaching bitcoin cautiously: \u201cWe saw a nice open on light volume, but pretty uneventful so far,\u201d \u201cThis is a brand-new asset class and I think perhaps a lot of investors want to sit back and see how this plays out before dipping their toes in this market.\u201d Also coming up today... Stock markets are expected to rise, as investors salivate over the prospect of US tax reforms being signed off by Donald Trump by the end of this week. New eurozone inflation figures are due this morning, and likely to show prices rose by just 1.5% in the last 12 months. In the UK, the CBI publishes its latest industrial trends survey, showing how British factories fared last month.

The PPF wanted \u00a39m to go into Toys R Us\u2019 defined-benefit fund up-front, meaning in the first few months of 2018. Instead, it has got \u00a32.2m up-front and \u00a31.6m next October, to be followed by two payments of \u00a33m in 2019 and 2020. You can call that \u00a39.8m but the extended timetable is a significant concession given that Toys R Us\u2019 long-term survival in the UK can hardly been viewed as certain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/20/toys-r-us-battles-to-win-support-of-pension\">Toys R Us holds last-minute talks with pensions body</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some companies prosper after so-called company voluntary arrangements (CVA); others are back on their knees within months. In the case of Toys R Us, the stores look to be 20 years behind the times and Amazon is still on the prowl.</p> <p>But the PPF was surely right to take the deal. The minimum requirement here was to ensure that, in most circumstances, the position of Toys R Us\u2019s pension fund won\u2019t deteriorate. That concern has probably been met. Even if the company\u2019s self-help trading plan fails after six months, the pension fund will have more money in it. And, if Toys R Us recovers, the PPF has secured advantages \u2013 a corporate promise to de-risk the scheme and close the \u00a330m deficit over a shortened timetable of 10 years. Both pledges are worth having.</p> <p>A pragmatic compromise is not a surprise. The PPF arrives on the scene when crisis has arrived, so its ability to play hardball is limited. For better results in future, the Pensions Regulator needs more powers to intervene earlier. Behind Thursday\u2019s mini-drama at Toys R Us sits the unexamined tale of the write-off of a \u00a3584m inter-company loan between the UK business and the US parent. The regulator must get to the bottom of that story urgently.</p> <h2>Developers should calm down over a few quid</h2> <p>Housebuilders were never going to like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/21/sajid-javid-promises-to-liberate-leaseholders-from-feudal-practices\">Sajid Javid\u2019s \u201ccrackdown on unfair leasehold practices</a>\u201d, but they brought it on themselves. The system, as the communities secretary says, is \u201cfeudal\u201d but it has been given a thoroughly modern spin by 21st century financing. All those onerous ground rents on long leaseholds have become an opportunity to convert cashflows into assets to be flogged to third parties, with the interests of leaseholders too often disregarded.</p> <p>Javid\u2019s measures are commendably strong. Developers will be banned from selling new houses on a leasehold basis, except where necessary, for example in cases of shared ownership. And ground rents on new long leases will be set at zero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/21/sajid-javid-promises-to-liberate-leaseholders-from-feudal-practices\">Sajid Javid promises to liberate leaseholders from 'feudal practices'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That second policy sent shares in <a href=\"https://www.mccarthyandstone.co.uk/\">McCarthy &amp; Stone</a>, a specialist in retirement homes, down 9%. Chief executive Clive Fenton was hopping mad, warning the proposal \u201cwill result in a disruption of housing supply\u201d.</p> <p>Up to a point, one can see why he\u2019s upset. Retirement \u201cvillages\u201d come with long-term maintenance agreements, so the ground rent could be considered akin to type of a service charge. But Fenton should calm down. His chances of securing an exception from the new rules are surely slim since Javid could just tell McCarthy to describe its charges properly and make them transparent.</p> <p>Such a switch might cost the company a few quid, but that\u2019s not the government\u2019s look-out. Either way, in the current housing climate, semi-threatening to build fewer homes is a poor way to ask for a favour \u2013 and probably ensures a thumbs-down.</p> <h2>A \u00a3265m embarrassment for Skanska</h2> <p>Another financial bubble? A year ago Swedish group Skanska sold a 40% stake in Connect Plus, which maintains the M25 motorway, for \u00a3265m. On Thursday, Balfour Beatty <a href=\"https://www.digitallook.com/news/news-and-announcements/balfour-beatty-to-make-103m-from-sale-of-m25-stake-lifts-profit-expectations--3041293.html\">sold a 12.5% stake</a> to a couple of infrastructure funds for \u00a3103m, implying its current 40% holding is worth \u00a3330m.</p> <p>So a motorway maintenance contract \u2013 which is all Connect Plus really is \u2013 has risen in value by 25% in 14 months. It\u2019s either an infrastructure bubble, or Skanska did a terrible deal.</p>",

The PPF wanted \u00a39m to go into Toys R Us\u2019 defined-benefit fund up-front, meaning in the first few months of 2018. Instead, it has got \u00a32.2m up-front and \u00a31.6m next October, to be followed by two payments of \u00a33m in 2019 and 2020. You can call that \u00a39.8m but the extended timetable is a significant concession given that Toys R Us\u2019 long-term survival in the UK can hardly been viewed as certain. Some companies prosper after so-called company voluntary arrangements (CVA); others are back on their knees within months. In the case of Toys R Us, the stores look to be 20 years behind the times and Amazon is still on the prowl. But the PPF was surely right to take the deal. The minimum requirement here was to ensure that, in most circumstances, the position of Toys R Us\u2019s pension fund won\u2019t deteriorate. That concern has probably been met. Even if the company\u2019s self-help trading plan fails after six months, the pension fund will have more money in it. And, if Toys R Us recovers, the PPF has secured advantages \u2013 a corporate promise to de-risk the scheme and close the \u00a330m deficit over a shortened timetable of 10 years. Both pledges are worth having. A pragmatic compromise is not a surprise. The PPF arrives on the scene when crisis has arrived, so its ability to play hardball is limited. For better results in future, the Pensions Regulator needs more powers to intervene earlier. Behind Thursday\u2019s mini-drama at Toys R Us sits the unexamined tale of the write-off of a \u00a3584m inter-company loan between the UK business and the US parent. The regulator must get to the bottom of that story urgently. Developers should calm down over a few quid Housebuilders were never going to like Sajid Javid\u2019s \u201ccrackdown on unfair leasehold practices\u201d, but they brought it on themselves. The system, as the communities secretary says, is \u201cfeudal\u201d but it has been given a thoroughly modern spin by 21st century financing. All those onerous ground rents on long leaseholds have become an opportunity to convert cashflows into assets to be flogged to third parties, with the interests of leaseholders too often disregarded. Javid\u2019s measures are commendably strong. Developers will be banned from selling new houses on a leasehold basis, except where necessary, for example in cases of shared ownership. And ground rents on new long leases will be set at zero. That second policy sent shares in McCarthy &amp; Stone, a specialist in retirement homes, down 9%. Chief executive Clive Fenton was hopping mad, warning the proposal \u201cwill result in a disruption of housing supply\u201d. Up to a point, one can see why he\u2019s upset. Retirement \u201cvillages\u201d come with long-term maintenance agreements, so the ground rent could be considered akin to type of a service charge. But Fenton should calm down. His chances of securing an exception from the new rules are surely slim since Javid could just tell McCarthy to describe its charges properly and make them transparent. Such a switch might cost the company a few quid, but that\u2019s not the government\u2019s look-out. Either way, in the current housing climate, semi-threatening to build fewer homes is a poor way to ask for a favour \u2013 and probably ensures a thumbs-down. A \u00a3265m embarrassment for Skanska Another financial bubble? A year ago Swedish group Skanska sold a 40% stake in Connect Plus, which maintains the M25 motorway, for \u00a3265m. On Thursday, Balfour Beatty sold a 12.5% stake to a couple of infrastructure funds for \u00a3103m, implying its current 40% holding is worth \u00a3330m. So a motorway maintenance contract \u2013 which is all Connect Plus really is \u2013 has risen in value by 25% in 14 months. It\u2019s either an infrastructure bubble, or Skanska did a terrible deal.",

                "bodyText":"Walk down almost any major New York street \u2013 say Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower, or Madison Avenue from midtown to the Upper East Side. Perhaps venture down Canal Street, or into the West Village around Bleecker, and some of the most expensive retail areas in the world are blitzed with vacant storefronts. The famed Lincoln Plaza Cinemas on the Upper West Side announced earlier this week that it is closing next month. A blow to the city\u2019s cinephiles, certainly, but also a sign of the effects that rapid gentrification, coupled with technological innovation, are having on the city. Over the past several years, thousands of small retailers have closed, replaced by national chains. When they, too, fail, the stores lie vacant, and landlords, often institutional investors, are unwilling to drop rents. A recent survey by New York councilmember Helen Rosenthal found 12% of stores on one stretch of the Upper West Side is unoccupied and \u2018for lease\u2019. The picture is repeated nationally. In October, the US surpassed the previous record for store closings, set after the 2008 financial crisis. The common refrain is that the devastation is the product of a profound shift in consumption to online, with Amazon frequently identified as the leading culprit. But this is maybe an over-simplification. \u201cIt\u2019s not Amazon, it\u2019s rent,\u201d says Jeremiah Moss, author of the website and book Vanishing New York. \u201cOver the decades, small businesses weathered the New York of the 70s with it near-bankruptcy and high crime.

Ryanair will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/20/ryanair-working-conditions-investigation-michael-o-leary\">investigated by two parliamentary committees</a> after allegations about employee working conditions, including that it has been \u201ctrying to wriggle out\u201d of paying its staff the national minimum wage, while setting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/23/ryanair-crew-told-to-sell-more-perfume-and-scratchcards-or-face-action\">tough in-flight sales targets</a>. </p> <p>The airline has said the claims about cabin crew pay and working conditions \u201care false\u201d. However, O\u2019Leary announced this month that he will begin talks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/ryanair-to-recognise-unions-in-historic-shift-to-stop-christmas-strike-by-pilots\">recognise pilot and cabin crew trade unions</a>. The success of these discussions will make him a subject of even greater focus than usual next year.</p> <p><strong>Emma Walmsley</strong></p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline backed away from its oncology drugs two years ago under Walmsley\u2019s predecessor, Sir Andrew Witty, but 2018 will represent efforts by the company to re-enter the field.</p> <p>She has reinstated cancer treatments as one of the planks of her strategy to restore the company\u2019s fortunes since taking the role last spring, after GSK lagged rivals in in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters.

Otherwise, Murdoch is expected to strike out on his own, given that his job with Fox will no longer be there if regulators clear the deal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e39b4994b2537735160ca564f08a8a86ebbc0e72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39b4994b2537735160ca564f08a8a86ebbc0e72/0_74_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss became the first bitcoin billionaires in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Mercedes-Benz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Winklevoss twins</strong><br></p> <p>Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss saw a new trend coming with the advent of social media.

Having admitted that his company may not always have treated its passengers quite as they hoped, O\u2019Leary is now contending with critics who accuse the airline of mistreating its staff. Ryanair will be investigated by two parliamentary committees after allegations about employee working conditions, including that it has been \u201ctrying to wriggle out\u201d of paying its staff the national minimum wage, while setting tough in-flight sales targets. The airline has said the claims about cabin crew pay and working conditions \u201care false\u201d. However, O\u2019Leary announced this month that he will begin talks to recognise pilot and cabin crew trade unions. The success of these discussions will make him a subject of even greater focus than usual next year. Emma Walmsley GlaxoSmithKline backed away from its oncology drugs two years ago under Walmsley\u2019s predecessor, Sir Andrew Witty, but 2018 will represent efforts by the company to re-enter the field. She has reinstated cancer treatments as one of the planks of her strategy to restore the company\u2019s fortunes since taking the role last spring, after GSK lagged rivals in in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters. It is now up to Walmsley to restore faith in the group\u2019s research and development skills. James Murdoch What next for James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox and younger son of Rupert Murdoch? Well, he is expected to leave his father\u2019s corporate orbit next year once Disney completes its $66bn (\u00a349bn) acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Disney has floated the possibility that Murdoch Jr might join the group in an executive role, and if he does the 45-year-old will be seen as a potential successor to Bob Iger, the Disney boss who looks unlikely to be wrestled out of the door until 2021. Otherwise, Murdoch is expected to strike out on his own, given that his job with Fox will no longer be there if regulators clear the deal. The Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss saw a new trend coming with the advent of social media. Unfortunately for them, their foresight did not extend to keeping a hold on the idea, so they ended up suing Mark Zuckerberg, who they claimed stole their idea for a social network and called it \u201cthe Facebook\u201d. Next year might give them a shot at further redemption after they became bitcoin billionaires in 2017. Having bought about 100,000 units of the cryptocurrency in 2013, when each coin was worth roughly $120, the value of each one rose to nearly $12,000 in early December and kept on soaring. Much of the financial world is waiting for what they view as a bubble to burst. Nicky Morgan Being one of the infamous Daily Telegraph front page \u201cBrexit mutineers\u201d did not faze the Conservative MP for Loughborough (she pinned a copy to her office wall), so it is hard to envisage her backing away from the limelight during 2018. She is not backing a second referendum, but believes leaving with no deal is suicidal. \u201cNo deal I think is a critical thing. And my role is to stop that happening,\u201d she said in December. Morgan has a platform for her campaign too, as chair of the influential Treasury select committee, which is likely to add to her profile and possibly her impact. Jeff Bezos The 53-year-old creator of Amazon is the world\u2019s richest man: his fortune increased by about $34bn in 2017 to take his net worth to $99.6bn. Having founded Amazon in his Seattle garage in 1994, Bezos now owns 16% of the retailer, which is hardly loved but appears practically unstoppable. He also owns all of space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper, which he bought for $250m in 2013. The question for 2018 is: can he get any richer? Steve Rowe Steve Rowe, the boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, is a veteran employee of the high street retailer, having taken a Saturday job in the Croydon store at the age of 15. Still, it is unlikely that even Rowe will have witnessed many years as crucial to M&amp;S as 2018 is shaping up to be. Alongside new chairman Archie Norman, the chief executive is attempting to revitalise this British institution. The scale of how far M&amp;S has fallen behind, however, is betrayed by the stock market: in 2017 its market value was eclipsed by takeaway group JustEat and by fashion firm Asos. Neither of the online companies was even close to being conceived when Rowe started his M&amp;S career. Sir Martin Sorrell The chief executive of the advertising firm WPP is surely someone to watch in 2018 \u2013 just ask him, he\u2019ll tell you so. Always interesting, sometimes entertaining and occasionally controversial, Sorrell tends to make himself relevant to the news cycle if there\u2019s ever a chance he might get overlooked. That is doubly true in World Cup years, when ad spend tends to get a bit of a lift, plus periods where there is any turbulence in geopolitics. It is unlikely he\u2019ll stay voluntarily quiet in 2018. Tim Martin Forget Al Murray, the boss of JD Wetherspoon is the real pub landlord. The Brexiter is one of the most articulate \u2013 and compelling \u2013 of the high-profile leave supporters, so is almost always worth listening to, no matter which way you voted. He has argued that Brexit should mean lower food prices (key remainers say it will mean the opposite), but if that seems far-fetched it\u2019s worth recalling how Martin was once derided for his views on the euro, which now look sage-like. Still, if the economy suffers any Brexit wobbles, and his pubs get hit, it will be worth watching him trying to explain why Brexit is a smart move.",

                "bodyText":"Despite today\u2019s losses on Wall Street, global stock markets had a historic year. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, rose in every single month - the first time ever that shares have avoided a monthly decline. Marketwatch\u2019s Ryan Vlastelica explains: In fact, the index hasn\u2019t had a down month since October 2016. It ended up 0.5% in December, and rose 21.8% over the course of the year. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, credited the strength to improving corporate profitability, tweeting, \u201cWhy have global stocks gone up every month so far this year? Earnings have too (both actual and expected).\u201d And on that note, we really are finished for 2017. Best wishes for the new year, and goodnight! Hello again. After a rollicking year, the US stock market actually ended the final session of 2017 with some small losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to end 2017 at 24,719.22, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 index also dropped 0.5% to close the year at 2,673.61, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.7% to end at 6,903.39. But it was still a very good year for the Dow, which closed at record levels on 71 occasions - itself a record. Hello again. Here\u2019s our news story about the global stock market rally this year: I may pop back later with the Wall Street close, or any other major events. Either way, we wish you all the best for 2018. Happy New Year! GW Amazon\u2019s share price has taken a knock, though, after Donald Trump tweeted that it was getting an unfairly generous deal from the US post service. Here\u2019s the tweet in question: Ding ding! Over in New York, the final trading day of the year is underway. And stocks are moving a little higher - with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 30 points or 0.12%, and the S&amp;P 500 index up 0.16%. 2017 has been a bumper year for America\u2019s stock market, with the Dow surging by 25%m, and the tech-focused Nasdaq up by nearly a third. Technology stocks had a particularly amazing year -- Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all jumped by over 50%, and Apple was close behind. Gold has had its best year since 2010, pushed up by the weaker US dollar. It just hit $1,300 for the first time since mid-October. The FTSE 100 surged by around \u00a3141bn during 2017, according to the London stock exchange. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies, gained around \u00a352bn as it rattled to fresh record highs. That fed into the $9 trillion surge in global share prices during this year (as measured by MSCI) Shares have been a pretty decent investment this year - giving a rather better return than your local bank. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre (a retail stockbroker) says there are reasons why shares could keep rising in 2018. He says: \u201cFor the second year in a row the FTSE100 has ended the year at an all-time high. Personal investors will have been relieved this year by a respite from the high volatility seen in the last couple of years. The level of volatility this year has though been remarkably low by historical standards and this has perhaps meant fewer trading opportunities for those investors who trade more actively. Market commentators have expressed concerns about valuation levels for some time indicating a correction may be on the horizon. However, the market appears to be shrugging off any such concerns and continuing to go from strength to strength. Higher global growth forecasts, a continuation of relatively relaxed monetary policy and a loosening of fiscal policy specifically in the United States are all helping support equities. A personal investor who put money into a FTSE 100 tracker fund at the start of this year will have seen a return of nearly 8% with a dividend payout (yield) of over 3% on top of that. With base rates now at just 0.5% and returns on cash remaining depressed the stark choice for investors seeking to drive an income from their capital is clear and this too helps drive demand for equities and equity based collectives (funds). Mining giants also had a good year, thanks to a boom in commodity prices which saw copper hit a four-year high this week. So, which shares should you have bought a year ago, and which should have come with a health warning? The best-performing share on the FTSE 100 during 2017 was actually a healthcare business based in the the United Arab Emirates, called NMC Health. It jumped by 86% during the year; any traders who backed NMC may be sprinting to the nearest City champagne bar this afternoon.... Second was Worldpay, the payments processor company spun out of the wreckage of Royal Bank of Scotland. It jumped by 57%, thanks to a takeover bid from US rival Vantiv. Housebuilders also had a strong year; Persimmon was the third-best performing member of the Footsie, up 54%, followed by Berkeley Group which gained 49%. But some companies will be glad to see the back of 2017. Centrica slumped by over 40%, partly due to a big profits warning in November, while telecommunications group BT and advertising giant WPP both shank by around a quarter. Breaking! A late burst of buy orders have sent Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index up to a new all-time high. The final trading day of 2017 ended with a flourish, with the FTSE 100 closing up 64 points or 0.85% at 7,687 points. Just before the close, it hit a new intraday high of 7697 points. This means the blue-chip index has gained 7.6% during 2017. With the smaller FTSE 250 index also closing at a new record high, this puts the seal on a good year for the London stock market. But, this still means the Footsie has lagged behind other stock markets - with Japan\u2019s Topix and the US S&amp;P 500 both up around 20% during 2017. Just 10 minutes until the end of the trading year in London, and the FTSE 100 is heading towards a fresh closing high..... World stock markets have surged to a new alltime high today, meaning they\u2019ve put on a blistering $9 trillion in value since the start of January. That\u2019s according to Reuters, which reports: Markets were ending 2017 in a party mood on Friday after a year in which a concerted pick-up in global growth boosted corporate profits and commodity prices, while benign inflation kept central banks from snatching away the monetary punch bowl. MSCI\u2019s world equity index, which tracks 47 countries, inched up 0.15% as six straight weeks and now 13 straight months of gains left it at yet another all time high. The index has been on an upward trajectory for pretty much all of 2017, putting it 22 percent and almost $9 trillion higher for the year. Emerging markets have led the charge with gains of 34%. Hong Kong surged 36%, South Korea notched up 22% and India and Poland both made 27% in local currency terms. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and the S&amp;P 500 are both ahead by almost 20%, while the Dow has risen by a quarter. In Europe, the German DAX has gained nearly 14 %, though the UK FTSE has lagged a little with a rise of 7%. More here: Stocks cheer $9 trillion year, downer for the dollar The euro has enjoyed its best year since 2003, thanks to the recovery in the eurozone economy. The single currency is the best performing G10 currency, according to Bloomberg data: More photos of traders celebrating the last day of trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange in Manila have arrived; it seemed wrong not to share them. Traders have plenty to celebrate -- the main Philippine stock index hit an alltime high this morning, and has gained 25% this year. That helped Asian shares to rack up their best year since 2009 (as discussed earlier). The smaller FTSE 250 index is also at record levels. It rose by 0.25% to 20,695 points, a gain of 55 points this morning. The FTSE 100 is pushing further into record territory, as City investors get their buy orders in before trading closes early at 12.30pm. The blue-chip index has now hit a fresh record high of 7,648 points, up 25 points or 0.3% today. Reuters points out that natural resourse stocks had a stonking year: Miners have been among the FTSE\u2019s best-performing stocks this year, with Antofagasta up 47.4% and Glencore up 40.7% year-to-date. Elsewhere NMC Health has been the index\u2019s best-performing stock, while a takeover has pushed Worldpay\u2019s shares 57 percent higher this year. Housebuilders Persimmon and Berkeley Group have both had a comeback year, recovering after seeing their shares plummet in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum in June 2016. Technology companies have led the rally in Europe this year, mirroring the surge in Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook et al. Miners, banks and industrial companies also had a good year, as this chart shows: Like most financial assets, shares are generally held by richer people (either directly or through pension funds). So the surge in global stock markets this year won\u2019t have helped tackle wealth inequality. The FTSE 100\u2019s 6% rise this year has outpaced inflation (3.1% in December) and wages (up 2.3% during 2017). And the bad news for British workers is that pay growth is likely to lag behind all other wealthy nations in 2018. 2017 hasn\u2019t just been about rising stock markets. Brexit, Donald Trump, food safety, inequality and even a giant, sadly deceased, rabbit called Simon featured in our most popular stories this year. Here\u2019s a round-up of the business news that got you all clicking this year. The strong rally in Asia\u2019s stock markets this year is particularly remarkable, given the geopolitical threat posed by North Korea and the risk that president Trump could trigger a trade war. But instead, traders have shrugged off these worries - sending shares jumping across the region. As CNBC puts it: While geopolitical uncertainty was a major focal point earlier this year \u2014 with several North Korean missile launches initially sending investor scurrying into safe-have assets \u2014 risk appetite has since improved, with markets looking instead to stronger economic growth globally. MSCI\u2019s broad index of shares in Asia Pacific excluding Japan was up more than 34 percent year-to-date on Friday morning. That\u2019s above the roughly 25 percent climb seen on the Dow Jones industrial average and 8 percent rise on the pan-European STOXX 600 over the same period. The London stock market is \u201cdoing its festive best\u201d to reach the New Year at a fresh record high, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Here are the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100, as it hovers around this morning\u2019s peak of 7,636 points. Most global stock markets have enjoyed strong gains this year. Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, said of the 73 bourses it tracks globally, all but nine have recorded gains in local currency terms this year (that\u2019s via Reuters). Japan\u2019s Topix share index has also enjoyed a bumper year; it\u2019s risen by over 19% during 2017. Traders held a ceremony to mark the end of the trading year, and invited Go champion Yuta Iyama to ring the closing bell. European stock markets are on track to record their best year since 2013. The Stoxx 600 index has just opened flat, leaving it on track for a near-8% gain over the last 12 months. The pound is also having a good morning. It\u2019s up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.35, a three-week high. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new record at the start of trading. The blue-chip index has jumped by 13 points to 7,636, slightly over yesterday\u2019s record high. It means the Footsie has risen by 4.5% during December - a month that saw Britain agree the first phase of a Brexit deal with Brussels. Just Eat, the fast food-ordering app company, is leading the risers, up 1.8%. It only joined the FTSE 100 this month, after seeing its value overtake the likes of supermarket chain J Sainsbury. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the final day of the trading year, and what a year it\u2019s been for investors. Stocks have surged world wide over the last 12 months - thanks to renewed confidence in the global economy and a steady drip-drip-drip of monetary stimulus from central bankers. Over in Asia, the markets have enjoyed their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which tracks stocks across the region, has surged by almost 29% this year. Hong Kong has enjoyed a particularly exuberant year - jumping by an sparkling 36%, while South Korea posted a 22% gain and India jumped by 27%. Ceremonies have already been taking place at stock markets across Asia, including in Tokyo and Manila. Many commodities have strengthened this year too, at the expense of the weaker US dollar. Donald Trump\u2019s push for tax cuts has not made the greenback great again. In Europe, many stock markets are already sitting on double-digit gains - Germany\u2019s DAX, for example, is up 13%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit fresh record highs this week, but has actually only gained around 6.7% during the year. Today\u2019s trading session will end at 12.30pm. So, a solid year for shares. But could the markets be peaking? Some investors worry that the good times could end soon. For example, an index from State Street that tracks investor risk appetite suffered its six straight monthly fall in December. As Michael Metcalfe, State Street\u2019s head of global macro strategy, put it: \u201cWhile the broader economic outlook appears increasingly rosy, as captured by measures of consumer and business confidence, the more cautious nature of investors hints at a concern that markets may have already discounted much of the good news.\u201d There\u2019s not much in the agenda (understandably), apart from new inflation figures from Germany.",

                "bodyText":"The rich got richer and the poor piled on more debt as shockwaves from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate in 2017. Billionaire George Soros dismissed Donald Trump as a \u201ccon-man\u201d, while Britain\u2019s biggest chicken supplier was revealed to have been fiddling its food safety records. Airlines had a turbulent year, from the sad death of Simon the giant rabbit to Ryanair\u2019s shock cancellation of thousands of flights after it messed up its pilot rosters. Based on the number of page views, here are our 10 most popular business stories of 2017. 1. Hard times for Whole Foods: \u2018People say it\u2019s for pretentious people. I can see why\u2019 A \u201cpretentious\u201d American grocery group nicknamed \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d made it to the top of our most-read list in 2017, as takeover rumours swirled around the once high-flying, organic-focused retailer. Shoppers loved Whole Foods\u2019 products, but not its prices: \u201cWhen you\u2019re shopping for the cheaper, more afofrdable things, you\u2019re reminded of the things you can\u2019t afford,\u201d said one. A consumer backlash had led to six straight quarters of declining sales by April. Two months later online giant Amazon swooped in with a $13.7bn takeover in a bold move seen as a game-changer for the entire food retail sector. 2. Deloitte hit by cyber-attack revealing clients\u2019 secret emails In September the Guardian revealed one of the world\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms had been the victim of a sophisticated cybersecurity attack that had gone unnoticed for months. The attack on Deloitte compromised confidential emails and plans of some of the firm\u2019s blue chip clients, including household name companies and US government departments. Hackers may have accessed usernames, passwords and other personal details. 3. United Airlines \u2018saddened\u2019 by death of giant rabbit after transatlantic flight Simon, a 10-month-old giant rabbit, met a sad end after a transatlantic flight from London Heathrow to Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport in April. Although he was alive when the United Airlines plane landed in America, Simon was later found dead in his cage in a pet facility run by the airline. It was a tragedy for Simon \u2013 whose owner said he had been \u201cas fit as a fiddle\u201d on leaving London \u2013 and another PR disaster for United Airlines. Just three weeks earlier, a video showing a passenger being dragged off a United flight had sparked widespread outrage. 4. George Soros: Theresa May won\u2019t last and Trump is \u2018would-be dictator\u2019 One of the highlights of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos was an attack on Donald Trump from octogenarian billionaire and philanthropist George Soros. At a plush dinner at the Swiss ski resort last January, the night before the presidential inauguration, Soros called Trump an \u2018imposter and a con-man\u201d who would trigger a trade war and try \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to rule as a dictator.

In undercover footage recorded at a 2 Sisters plant, workers were seen altering the slaughter date of poultry being processed, which may have duped customers into buying out-of-date meat. 6. Ryanair may face legal action over flight cancellations Ryanair was forced to cancel thousands of flights after a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it scheduled time off for its pilots. Chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary apologised to customers but the budget airline\u2019s inept handling of the roster-related cancellations served to compound the outrage, as it was accused by the Civil Aviation Authority of \u201cpersistently misleading passengers\u201d about their rights. By the end of the year, the airline would finally recognise pilot and cabin crew unions, marking dramatic shift after decades of refusing to negotiate with them. 7.

The six restaurants shuttered accounted for less than 5% of the restaurant chain\u2019s total turnover and overall the chain was continuing to perform well both in the UK and abroad. 8. World\u2019s witnessing a new Gilded Age as billionaires\u2019 wealth swells to $6tn Not since the time of the Carnegies, Rockerfellers and Vanderbilts at the turn of the 20th century was so much owned by so few, as a new wealth report published in October revealed that billionaires had increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth, to a record $6tn. But the world\u2019s ultra-wealthy were, apparently, worried by this new \u201cGilded Age\u201d. According to the the lead author of the UBS/PwC Billionaires report they feared the growing gap between rich and poor could lead to a \u201cstrike back\u201d. 9. Chief economist of Bank of England admits errors in Brexit forecasting \u201cIt\u2019s a fair cop\u201d, admitted the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane just a few days into the new year, as he accepted that the UK\u2019s central bank had misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote. Economists had been brought into disrepute by a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash, and for predicting there would be a dramatic slowdown in the economy if the UK were to vote to leave the EU, he said. But while the Bank was wrong about the timing of a post-Brexit slump, Haldane insisted it would be proved right about the fundamentals. 10. Britain\u2019s debt timebomb: FCA urges action over \u00a3200bn crisis Britain\u2019s borrowing binge topped \u00a3200bn, prompting a warning from the nation\u2019s chief financial regulator that the government needed to step in to avert a debt crisis. Andrew Bailey told the Guardian that he was concerned about the sheer number of people who need loans to make ends meet, pinpointing gig economy workers as particularly vulnerable. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"2017 was a year marked by mini-upsets in the business world that, taken together, represented a changing of the old guard and a new establishment taking shape. Technology fuelled a revolution which saw upstarts in retail, manufacturing and finance overtake long-established players. Whether it was payment cards or Bitcoin trumping cash or currencies, or the battery coming of age over the internal combustion engine, these were seminal moments. Maureen Hinton, a director at research firm GlobalData said: \u201cThese disruptors have adapted to new demand and changing lifestyles far quicker than traditional businesses often because they can create from scratch, rather than having to adapt an existing model.\u201d The disruptors made 2017 their own in a good year for the upstart. Asos leapfrogs Marks &amp; Spencer The biggest upset of the year in the UK was in retail. Marks &amp; Spencer, Britain\u2019s favourite clothing retailer, was overtaken last month by Asos, the fashion website still listed on the junior AIM market. This was seen as a pivotal moment on the high street because M&amp;S, which dates back to 1884, was dwarfed by its 17-year-old rival in terms of its stock market value. A month on and the gap is even wider with Asos worth \u00a35.2bn compared with M&amp;S\u2019s \u00a34.9bn. The power of the relatively new online player over such well-established retail royalty is a sign of the times on the high street. Shopping habits have changed. Customers have fallen out of love with tired and dated town-centre shops and there is a growing trend toward buying items online. M&amp;S has struggled in recent years to deliver on-trend designs in women\u2019s clothing from its expensive stores. Asos, which used to be called As Seen on Screen, started out by selling cheap copies of celebrity fashion items, and has carved a niche delivering cheap popular designs to a faithful and growing band of young shoppers. This could not have come at a worse time for M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Steve Rowe, who has just cbegun a five-year transformation programme and has promised to bring the company\u2019s clothing business back on track. Aldi overtakes Co-op Store openings and bigger more beautiful premises helped Aldi leapfrog the more established Co-op to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest supermarket. The German upstart, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market from 5.6% to 6.2% in February, compared with the same 12-week period the previous year, according to the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.

The innovation of using contactless, where you can wave your card in front of a payment machine without having to enter a pin, has however meant more people are using cards for buying lower value items.
