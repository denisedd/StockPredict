                "bodyText":"Shares on Wall Street have hit record levels as financial markets around the world anticipate the biggest package of US tax cuts since Ronald Reagan was in the White House in the 1980s. Investors bought heavily into US stocks after Donald Trump received approval from the Senate for reforms that offer the biggest reduction in taxes to corporations and those on high incomes. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 hit record levels in early trading but later fell back because of a sell-off of technology stocks, which have seen substantial price rises this year. But there was heavy buying of telecom, bank, financial and other shares in sectors seen as benefiting from the tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy. The technology sector is expected to benefit less because it already enjoys low tax rates. Although the final details of the package have still to be finalised through an agreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives, Wall Street believes that the president has finally succeeded in a near year-long battle to get Congress to support his plan. The Dow Jones closed just 58 points up, while the S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% down. The latter has risen about 18% since the start of the year on strong corporate earnings, economic growth and confidence that Trump would eventually get his tax cuts. Markets have shrugged off concerns that the cuts, like those in the 1980s, will lead to a ballooning of the US budget deficit.

Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-04T13:44:38.064Z\">at 1.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a2542fcae3bcb05d20248a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-04T12:50:03.233Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live?page=with:block-5a2515b7a1bc53061d9286a7#block-5a2515b7a1bc53061d9286a7\">Britain\u2019s construction</a> and manufacturing sectors picked up in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UlrikBie/status/937663592677158912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While the Brexit divorce negotiations have entered a critical phase, British construction PMI extends a strong rebound <a href=\"https://t.co/Vm0nlWWnwp\">pic.twitter.com/Vm0nlWWnwp</a></p>&mdash; Ulrik Bie (@UlrikBie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UlrikBie/status/937663592677158912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 4, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a253cf7a1bc53061d9287ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-04T12:25:42.695Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live?page=with:block-5a25323f0470380699b541b8#block-5a25323f0470380699b541b8\">those reports of a deal over the Irish borde</a>r.</strong></p> <p><strong>Hamish Muress,</strong> currency analyst at <a href=\"http://www.ofx.com/en-gb/\"><strong>OFX</strong></a>, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months.</p> <p>Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d.

                "bodyText":"So, not the most convincing rally we\u2019ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we\u2019ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to \u2018sell the news\u2019 and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn\u2019t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we\u2019ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That\u2019s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s stock market rally. It\u2019s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here\u2019s Nils\u2019 column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren\u2019t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal\u2019s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It\u2019s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn\u2019t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May\u2019s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today\u2019s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \u201cGetting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn\u2019t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there\u2019s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here\u2019s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \u201cI think this bill is very dangerous,\u201d he said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program. \u201cWhen people lose health insurance, they\u2019re less likely to get preventive care, they\u2019re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they\u2019re more likely to die.\u201d Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county\u2019s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \u201cit was exceptional\u201d it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the \u20ac86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate\u2019s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let\u2019s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump\u2019s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump\u2019s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There\u2019s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate\u2019s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That\u2019d leave the Dow at \u2013 what else \u2013 a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday\u2019s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it\u2019s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country\u2019s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth \u20ac5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today \u2013 less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \u201cAlthough a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\u201d It\u2019s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 \u2018prior actions\u2019 or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures \u2013 a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone \u2013 is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the \u20ac86bn bailout programme, the country\u2019s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain\u2019s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it\u2019s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at \u20ac1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \u201cfar-reaching implications\u201d. But it\u2019s not clear that Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they\u2019re currently propping up Theresa May\u2019s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reforms\u2019 is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland\u2019s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That\u2019s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America\u2019s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate\u2019s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump\u2019s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market\u2019s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \u201cAfter the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \u201cResidential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u201cOn the frontline we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK\u2019s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite \u2018brittle, adding: \u201cAnecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain\u2019s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit\u2019s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain\u2019s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October\u2019s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October\u2019s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \u201cUK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \u201cConstruction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump\u2019s push to cut America\u2019s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies\u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft\u2013currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech\u2019s Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe\u2019s stock markets are recovering from Friday\u2019s shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cEuropean markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend\u2019s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump\u2019s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate\u2019s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President\u2019s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump\u2019s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president\u2019s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \u201cvery, very happy\u2019. But...the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d plan to cut taxes for \u201caverage Americans\u201d has been criticised by experts who say it\u2019s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \u201cIn the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \u201cEvery time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\u201d But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven\u2019t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u201cthere is still a way to go\u201d to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures. Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report 3pm GMT: US factory orders for October",

                "bodyText":"2017 was a year marked by mini-upsets in the business world that, taken together, represented a changing of the old guard and a new establishment taking shape. Technology fuelled a revolution which saw upstarts in retail, manufacturing and finance overtake long-established players. Whether it was payment cards or Bitcoin trumping cash or currencies, or the battery coming of age over the internal combustion engine, these were seminal moments. Maureen Hinton, a director at research firm GlobalData said: \u201cThese disruptors have adapted to new demand and changing lifestyles far quicker than traditional businesses often because they can create from scratch, rather than having to adapt an existing model.\u201d The disruptors made 2017 their own in a good year for the upstart. Asos leapfrogs Marks &amp; Spencer The biggest upset of the year in the UK was in retail. Marks &amp; Spencer, Britain\u2019s favourite clothing retailer, was overtaken last month by Asos, the fashion website still listed on the junior AIM market. This was seen as a pivotal moment on the high street because M&amp;S, which dates back to 1884, was dwarfed by its 17-year-old rival in terms of its stock market value. A month on and the gap is even wider with Asos worth \u00a35.2bn compared with M&amp;S\u2019s \u00a34.9bn. The power of the relatively new online player over such well-established retail royalty is a sign of the times on the high street. Shopping habits have changed. Customers have fallen out of love with tired and dated town-centre shops and there is a growing trend toward buying items online. M&amp;S has struggled in recent years to deliver on-trend designs in women\u2019s clothing from its expensive stores. Asos, which used to be called As Seen on Screen, started out by selling cheap copies of celebrity fashion items, and has carved a niche delivering cheap popular designs to a faithful and growing band of young shoppers. This could not have come at a worse time for M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Steve Rowe, who has just cbegun a five-year transformation programme and has promised to bring the company\u2019s clothing business back on track. Aldi overtakes Co-op Store openings and bigger more beautiful premises helped Aldi leapfrog the more established Co-op to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest supermarket. The German upstart, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market from 5.6% to 6.2% in February, compared with the same 12-week period the previous year, according to the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. This trumped the 6% share controlled by the Co-op, which opened its first self-service store in 1942 and can trace its history back to 1844. Aldi\u2019s rise, along with its smaller rival Lidl, has been something of a phenomenon. Both have turned grocery shopping on its head by selling a limited range of lines. Aldi stores often stock just 1,500 lines compared with as many as 40,000 at the big four supermarkets, and 90% are own brand. Customers pass through its tills 40% faster because it uses checkouts with longer conveyor belts that accommodate the entire contents of a trolley. The items also have bigger bar codes in three different positions, which are more likely to be captured first time when scanned. It is such attention to detail that is behind its success. The Co-op\u2019s market share also diminished because it sold 300 stores to the convenience chain McColl\u2019s last year, and refocused on its own smaller convenience stores rather than bigger supermarkets. This was also the year that Lidl overtook Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s seventh biggest grocer. Just Eat delivers more market value than Sainsbury Still in the consumer space, the takeaway king Just Eat has caused some of Britain\u2019s biggest grocers a bout of indigestion. The fast-food ordering website which makes no products and owns no outlets has now made it into the FTSE100 leading index of top companies. It has gained its hefty valuation simply by creaming cash off orders placed with third party restaurants hosted on its website and apps.

The innovation of using contactless, where you can wave your card in front of a payment machine without having to enter a pin, has however meant more people are using cards for buying lower value items.
