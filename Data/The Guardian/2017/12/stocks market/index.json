Have a good weekend and please join us again on Monday. AM US manufacturing grew at a solid pace in November, but at a slower rate than October, according to the IHS Markit PMI report. The headline index dipped to 53.9 in November from 54.6 in October. (Anything above 50 signals growth.) Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: US manufacturers reported further solid growth in November. The rate of expansion settled slightly after October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound from the hurricanes, but still leaves the sector on course for its best quarter since the opening months of 2015. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s especially encouraging is that growth is being led by producers of business equipment and machinery, indicating investment spending is on the rise. Jobs growth in the sector has also picked up in recent months compared with the subdued hiring earlier in the year, suggesting that an expansionary mood is beginning to prevail in the goods producing sector. Business optimism is now at its highest since the start of 2016, underscoring how firms believe the upturn has further to run as we move into 2018. The government has attracted criticism from unions and the Labour party today, for failing to intervene in RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to close 259 bank branches. They point out the bank is still 71% owned by the taxpayer after the 2008 bailout. A Treasury spokesperson has responded: The decision to open and close branches is a commercial decision taken by the management team of each bank. The Government does not intervene in these decisions. But we understand the impact that closures can have on communities and peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 jobs. Banks must now give customers as much notice as possible when a branch is closing, and ensure they are made aware of the options they have locally to continue to access banking services. A reminder of how bitcoin has performed so far this year: After a record day for US stocks on Thursday, Wall Street is pretty flat in early trading: Dow Jones: +0.2% at 24,314 S&amp;P 500: -0.04% at 2,647 Nasdaq: -0.4% at 6,846 Over in Athens, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helena Smith reports on a breakthrough in talks with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It appears that we will have a staff-level agreement by Saturday,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a finance ministry official on the sidelines of round-the-clock talks currently taking place in Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hilton hotel. Negotiations, which have focused on taxes and fiscal issues, will continue into the weekend. If concluded the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos would be in a much stronger position to have the accord rubber-stamped when he attends Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of eurozone finance ministers - the Eurogroup - in Brussels. Athens is set to receive a further aid tranche in February. The IMF is also participating in the talks but has yet to participate in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many hope \u00e2\u20ac\u201c final bailout until euro group countries agree on debt relief measures that would alleviate Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 staggering debt load. The review is due to be finalised officially when the Eurogroup next meets on January 22nd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provided that Athens also completes 101 reforms known as prior actions. If as expected that happens, it will be the first time in more than seven years of negotiations with the lenders keeping it afloat that Greece will have conformed enough to avoid the often tortuous haggling that has marked talks. A fourth and final review will follow before the country exits its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c imposed to prevent it crashing out of the euro at the height of the debt crisis in 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in August 2018. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric price rises won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last when institutional investors enter the market. That is the view of David Coker, a lecturer at Westminster business school and former vice president of global risk management at Deutsche Bank. Coker says: Many folks seem to have been surprised by bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent increase in price, first to ten thousand dollars and then, in rapid order, to eleven thousand dollars. However, these increases were to be expected given the cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent momentum. As the end of the tax year approaches, many Americans need to invest their annual pension contributions and bitcoin is the next \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot stock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to buy. Clearly speculative money is flowing into bitcoin, driven by relentless media coverage and, of course, meteoric price increases but this should not lead us to assume that extreme price volatility is a permanent feature of bitcoin. The entry of institutional investors into the market will bring a longer term perspective to the asset class and they will likely stabilise prices over time through their use of derivatives. As frustrating as it might be, sometimes the best thing to do in a fast moving market is nothing. Bitcoin is up 7% at $10,642 after the US derivatives regulator said it would allow CME Group and CBOE Global Markets to list bitcoin futures. Reuters explains: The announcement by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission paves the way for CME and CBOE to become the first traditional US regulated exchanges to launch trading in bitcoin-related financial contracts, a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency that could lead to greater regulatory scrutiny. The scores are in and Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. That put Canada on a par with the UK and Italy, where growth was also 0.4% in the July to September period. Here is how all the G7 economies performed in Q3: US: 0.8% Germany: 0.8% France: 0.5% UK: 0.4% Canada: 0.4% Italy: 0.4% Japan: 0.3% Jonathan Reynolds, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow City minister, says RBS should be putting the needs of its customers first, rather than closing branches: The decision by RBS to close one in four of its outlets is hugely disappointing. Not only will this result in the potential loss of 1,000 jobs, but many people depend on being able to use bank branch facilities in person. As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers. We are astounded that the Government has signed off on these proposals and urge them to reconsider such a drastic move which risks serious harm to local communities. Labour will change bank regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities and businesses. Which?, the independent consumer advice service, has provided a useful interactive map of UK bank branch closures since 2015. The map can be found here. Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?, said: With bank branch closures gathering pace, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital that banks ensure all consumers have access to vital everyday banking services, no matter where they live. At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need. Here is a full report from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, Larry Elliott, on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong UK manufacturing figures: Bitcoin is back above $10,000... It is currently up 3% on the day at $10,250. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist who worked for Bill Clinton, is the latest critic of the digital currency: The boss of Fortnum &amp; Mason says the world famous London store is struggling to recruit staff after the Brexit vote, with the situation most acute in its restaurants. Chief executive Ewan Venters says one in five of the chef posts across its six restaurants were unfilled as the drop in the value of the pound and concerns about anti-migrant attitudes deterred applicants. He said: Brexit is an alarming issue for me in terms of our ability to hire and retain good people. They are asking: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDo I feel welcome?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more the problem today. Read our full story here: The Scottish secretary David Mundell has said that he is seeking an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lifeline for many people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mundell said: I am very disappointed to hear of the plans by the Royal Bank of Scotland to close so many of their branches across Scotland. This is a serious issue for the communities they serve. While usage of branches may have dropped, they are still a lifeline for many people, especially in rural areas. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be seeking a meeting with the senior leadership of RBS to discuss these closures as a matter of urgency. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club forecasting group, says the manufacturing sector is the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leading light\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A quick update on bitcoin after the wild volatility seen earlier in the week. It is currently down 0.9% on the day, at $9,883, having hit a new record high of $11,395 on Wednesday. Here is our latest story on the cryptocurrency that has got everybody talking: After a mixed start, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets have sunk into the red: David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says a stronger euro is weighing on shares: The rally in the euro is hurting the eurozone equity benchmarks, as the DAX, CAC 40 and FTSE MIB are firmly in the red this morning. The continental equity markets are paying the price for their economic recovery, ultimately a stronger economy often translates into a stronger stock market, but for now the rally in the euro is holding them back. The pound has dipped back below $1.35 and is currently down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3486. It has made up some of the losses against the euro, but is still down 0.1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1342. Scotiabank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniela Russell says that while the manufacturing PMI is encouraging for the wider economic performance in the fourth quarter, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too carried away just yet. This strong gain reinforces a fairly optimistic outlook for fourth quarter GDP growth. However, with manufacturing making up only 10% of the economy, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited just yet before we get the key services PMI survey next week. But if that does paint a similarly positive picture, then it would suggest that momentum is still strong as we head towards the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and perhaps growth in 2018 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be quite as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility is forecasting. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade body, says the manufacturing PMI \u00e2\u20ac\u0153points to everything coming up roses for manufacturing in the closing months of the year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says the outlook for UK manufacturing is positive: This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline result has been boosted by strong domestic demand and significant gains in new export business, driven by overseas growth in US and Europe. The impact of previous declines in sterling appears to be reducing, as the index indicates that the UK manufacturing sector continues to strengthen. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result sees the highest level in four years and follows the strongest order books in almost 30 years reported by the CBI, increasing optimism among manufacturers. Lots of reaction coming in to those stronger-than-expected UK manufacturing figures for November. James Smith, economist at ING, says global growth is boosting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector: The big economic story of 2017 has been the positive turnaround in global growth, which along with the weaker pound, has seen manufacturing sentiment soar in the UK. The manufacturing sector is clearly a bright spot in the UK economy at the moment. However, given that manufacturing represents a relatively small share of the UK economy, the ongoing consumer slowdown and the knock-on effect this is having on retailers is a bigger concern, and is why we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect overall growth to accelerate in 2018. Royal Bank of Scotland has published the full list of the 259 branches that will close. The vast majority - 197 - are Nat West branches and the full list can be found here. The remaining 62 are RBS branches and the full list can be found here. Here is how the UK manufacturing sector has performed over the past two decades, in chart form: Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, described the November report as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overwhelmingly upbeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She adds: November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit/CIPS manufacturing survey suggests that growth in the sector has accelerated further in then fourth quarter. Encouragingly, the more forward-looking survey balances suggest that the sector should sustain this pace over the coming months too. Overall, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey provides us with further optimism that the manufacturing sector will continue to play a role in offsetting the slowdown in the consumer services sector. Boom boom... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories enjoyed the best month in four years in November, topping expectations and providing hope for the wider economy. The headline index on the IHS Markit/CIPS PMI survey rose to 58.2 last in November, from 56.6 in October, fuelled by a sharp rise in new orders from both within the UK and abroad. It easily beat the forecasts of economists polled by Reuters, who expected a headline number of 56.5. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit: UK manufacturing shifted up a gear in November, with growth of output, new orders and employment all gathering pace. On its current course, manufacturing production is rising at a quarterly rate approaching 2%, providing a real boost to the pace of broader economic expansion. Germany earned its reputation as a manufacturing powerhouse in November, leading the rest of the eurozone higher. Here is how the sector performed in individual countries (anything above 50 signals expansion): Germany: 62.5 Netherlands: 62.4 Austria: 61.9 Italy: 58.3 Ireland: 58.1 France: 57.7 Spain: 56.1 Greece: 52.2 Eurozone production lines were firing on all cylinders in November according to the IHS Markit manufacturing PMI survey. The headline index rose to 60.1 from 58.5 in October, where anything above 50 signals growth. It was the second highest on record for the index - which measures output, orders and jobs - after April 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said all the signs were there for a strong performance from the sector in 2018: Companies are clearly expanding rapidly. Employment growth has hit an all-time high and business investment on machinery is trending sharply upwards, suggesting manufacturers are looking forward to the upturn persisting well into 2018. The Highlands MSP Kate Forbes has accused high street banks of deserting her constituency after Royal Bank of Scotland was the latest to announce a series of closures across the region. Branches in Aviemore, Beauly, Kyle of Lochalsh and Mallaig will all shut by the summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving some constituents more than 40 miles away from their nearest RBS. Although in all cases there are alternative arrangements with the local Post Office as well as a visiting mobile bank, Kate Forbes MSP said she was deeply concerned about what the closures will mean for rural communities across Scotland. The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: RBS is just the latest bank to abandon the Highlands and forget the locally communities who depend on their services. These banks are deserting the Highlands. How are elderly and vulnerable customers supposed to access banking services, when they are expected to drive an hour from Mallaig to Fort William, or from Kyle to Portree? That is, of course, if the bus service is working perfectly. Banks face choices as to where they focus their activities and it is clear but the waves of closures across the Highlands that national banks are failing rural customers and businesses in the Highlands. Forbes, who said that she had already raised her concerns with senior representatives of RBS, added: Many of us now use online banking, whether on the internet or by phone apps but the local branch is still very important for those who depend on physically visiting the local branch, such as elderly customers or businesses depositing cash. The pound is just about keeping its head above the $1.35 mark this morning, after surpassing it on Thursday for the first time since the end of September. It is down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3511, and down 0.3% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1323. Here is our full story on the news from RBS this morning: RBS shares are down 1% this morning after the news that it will be closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. That makes it one of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers, in a session where the index overall is slightly up. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says the FTSE has got off to a slow start this morning: The FTSE got off to another slow start, scraping together a meagre 0.1% rise to just about lift away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 month nadir. While the commodity stocks are all in the green, the UK index is being hampered by its banking sector, with RBS leading its peers lower after announcing it is closing 259 branches and axing 680 jobs nationwide. He says the performance of the FTSE and the pound over the rest of today will be dependent on the UK manufacturing PMI survey for November, out at 9.30am. The closure of 259 RBS and Nat West branches will leave the banking group with 744 branches across the UK: 89 in Scotland 655 in England and Wales The FTSE 100 is currently up 8 points in a fairly subdued opening session across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,335 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.2% at 13,046 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.1% at 5,370 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 22,322 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,222 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.02% at 387 MPs react to the news of closures and job cuts... Unite, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest union, says RBS is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decimating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its branch network and betraying local communities. It says the bailed-out bank is denying access to local banking for thousands of taxpayers. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer: The Royal Bank of Scotland has decided to decimate its bank branch network. Now serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking. This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities. The closure of another 259 branches is savage and represents a betrayal of loyal staff and customers who have supported the bank for decades. Why is the Government signing off this alarming branch closure programme? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that it is closing a total of 259 branches, with the loss of 680 jobs. The total includes 62 RBS branches and 197 NatWest branches. The banks said it will try and manage the redundancy process on a voluntary basis. RBS said that since 2014, the number of customers using its UK branches has fallen by 40% while mobile transactions have increased by 73%. A spokesperson said: Over 5 million customers now use our mobile banking app and one in five only bank with us digitally. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re providing our customers with more ways to bank than ever before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they can choose from a range of digital, to face-to-face options. As customers continue to change the way they bank with us, we must change the way we serve them, so we are investing in our more popular branches and shaping our network, replacing traditional bricks and mortar branches with alternative ways to bank. We expect these branch closures to result in around 680 redundancies. We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected. We will ensure compulsory redundancies are kept to an absolute minimum. Also coming up today, we have a host of manufacturing PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which will give us the first insight into how the sector - and the wider economy - performed in November: 9am GMT: eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI 1.30pm GMT: Canadian growth figures for the third quarter (giving us the complete picture of for the G7 economies) 2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI",

                "bodyText":"Bitcoin is the fastest-growing asset in the world this year, but the virtual currency does not appear to have many users in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech district. It has been more than a month since bitcoin was used to buy a flat white or craft beer sold at the Old Shoreditch Station, according to the hospitality manager at the east London bar. Louis Chauvin admits he cannot find the iPad that is used by staff for processing bitcoin payments, as he resumes serving customers queueing to pay with their contactless bank cards. Although the establishment sits in the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buzzing tech hub, and is advertised online as one of the few retailers in London accepting the hipster-cum-computer nerds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 currency, as few as 20 people have asked to pay with it in the two years he has worked there. Over the same period, the value of a single bitcoin has rocketed from around $300 to more than $11,000 this week. On Friday, the currency was trading at $10,700. Chauvin says bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and media coverage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has not escaped customers. More people have come in asking how it works, thinking of using it in their own shop, rather than actually paying with it, he says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cool, it attracts some people. But for now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s niche.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bitcoin is a digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency, that emerged after the financial crisis and is not underpinned by a central bank. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods for goods and services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an idea that has evidently caught the imagination of some investors, because its price has surged by more than 900% in 2017. Bitcoin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c created by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153miners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who use high-powered computers to solve complex mathematical problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c must be stored online using a digital wallet, and can be bought or sold using exchanges such as Bitstamp, Bithumb and Kraken. But as bitcoin hits the stratosphere, there are fears an economic bubble is forming as it becomes treated less like a currency and more like a store of value, open for speculators making ever increasing bets on how far it can rise. Central bankers, who had to step in when the subprime mortgage bubble burst, have also warned of its dangers. Economists have compared bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise with past bubbles, such as the tulip mania of the 17th century and the dotcom bubble that began in the late 90s with the Nasdaq index in New York and burst in 2000.

                "bodyText":"Investors are ignoring warning signs that financial markets could be overheating and consumer debts are rising to unsustainable levels, the global body for central banks has warned in its quarterly financial health check. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said the situation in the global economy was similar to the pre-2008 crash era when investors, seeking high returns, borrowed heavily to invest in risky assets, despite moves by central banks to tighten access to credit. The BIS, known as the central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bank, said attempts by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to choke off risky behaviour by raising interest rates had failed so far and unstable financial bubbles were continuing to grow. Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS, said central banks might need to reconsider changing the way they communicated base interest rate rises or the speed at which they were increasing rates to jolt investors into recognising the need to calm asset markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vulnerabilities that have built around the globe during the long period of unusually low interest rates have not gone away. High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy valuations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The warning came as Neil Woodford, one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most high-profile fund managers, said stock markets were in danger of crashing, resulting in huge losses for millions of people. The founder of Woodford Investment Management, which manages \u00c2\u00a315bn worth of assets, told the Financial Times that investors were at risk of the market experiencing a repeat of the dotcom crash of the early 2000s. Woodford said he was concerned that historically low levels of interest rates in most developed nations over the last decade were pushing asset prices to unsustainable levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ten years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BIS said the benign global economy, which is predicted by the International Monetary Fund to see growth accelerate next year to 3.7% from 3.6% this year, was encouraging investors to dismiss concerns about high debt levels and growing asset bubbles. Economists have become concerned that high-risk investments such as European junk bonds yield similar returns to relatively safe investments such as US government bonds. There are also concerns that some of the most popular investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds are backed with vast sums of borrowed money. Woodford also noted that measures of volatility in financial markets had stayed low for an unprecedentedly long period, indicating that investors were betting that the current economic benign period would continue and asset prices would increase for several more years. The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending on risky assets such as the US subprime mortgages that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash and the financial crisis. The organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist at the time, William White, who now chairs the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review committee, warned last year that global debt levels had escalated to unstable levels largely in response to almost zero interest rates to create a situation that was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worse than 2007\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Borio was more circumspect, but said the current attempts to tighten credit with gradual interest rate rises had failed to deter risky behaviour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ease?,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even as the Fed has proceeded with its tightening, overall financial conditions have eased. If financial conditions are the main transmission channel for tighter policy, has policy, in effect, been tightened at all?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England has repeatedly expressed concern about mounting consumer debt in the UK. The BIS has ranked the UK among the most vulnerable countries in terms of households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt service burdens, especially if interest rates were to be raised rapidly. Last week the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank reported that consumer debt in October had grown by 9.6%, more than four times the average for wage increases of 2.2%.

But it also argues that consumers should have the power to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take their data with them to another provider\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to encourage competition in telecommunications, banking and other industries. Last week the assistant minister for cities and digital transformation, Angus Taylor, announced that next year the government would seek to legislate a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer data right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which would enable customers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open access to their banking, energy, phone and internet transactions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This would make it much easier to compare the cost of different services and crucially reduce the burden of switching banks or utility providers. The Grattan Institute report highlights that while market concentration can lead to excess profit-taking by firms, this mostly occurs in industries where the barriers to entry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either due to cost or the nature of the business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are high. In such cases the government needs to ensure firms are not taking advantage of consumers, but the report also makes clear that while firms have too much market power in a few industries, overall Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is little different from most nations.",

But the blistering tone of the now-leaked letter is worth noting. It is hard to recall a similar instance of a board of a large FTSE 100 company being read the riot act over the appointment of a chairman.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an extract: Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, which represents big fund management groups, said he was relating the views of 13 shareholders representing 20% of the London investor base and wrote on 21 November: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While these long-term shareholders are supportive of the company and its operational strategy, given the challenges facing the organisation, they are of the strong opinion that the individual currently being identified in the media as a potential chairman is not an acceptable candidate.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The clear position of these shareholders would suggest that the company should expect a very hostile audience should it choose to pursue this course of action.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business career has always divided opinion. Some fund managers applaud the deal-making that built Xstrata into a $50bn company at the moment he was taken over by Glencore. Others can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stomach the personal rewards for Xstrata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass, including the \u00c2\u00a3140m retention package that executives were offered to stay after the takeover. But, remember, Davis had been interviewed and picked by the board of Rio as the frontrunner. A U-turn in these circumstances is unusual.</p> <p>A welcome victory for shareholder power? Up to a point. Almost everybody is in favour of big investors engaging actively with companies and, in this case, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair argument that Rio doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a swashbuckling, deal-making chairman at a moment when it is preaching a gospel of disciplined capital allocation. That, as it happens, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/nov/14/tesco-booker-deal-investors-cma-shareholders\">this column\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view</a> a few weeks ago.</p> <p>But, in Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoes, you would also want to know why the Investor Forum mentioned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high personal integrity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as one of three \u00e2\u20ac\u0153key investor considerations for this appointment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That could be read as a general comment. But, in the context of the letter, it could also be taken as personal, nasty and below the belt. Davis, a well-known philanthropist, is entitled to an explanation.</p> <h2>Stock market highs are just a sugar rush</h2> <p>Another day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/04/markets-rally-trump-tax-reform-brexit-uk-construction-pound-business-live\">another record for Wall Street</a>, and another chance for Donald Trump to spin the shallow idea that his presidency must be successful because stock prices are rising.</p> <p>The notion is shallow because cutting corporate taxes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thereby delivering an instant boost to companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was always likely to push the stock market higher. The process is almost mechanical, especially for big US-focused companies such as banks and energy companies.</p> <p>But, once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example.</p> <p>But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that.</p> <h2>Workers on boards? How about a non-executive director?</h2> <p>Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recall, one last time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-plan-workers-boardroom-reform-extraordinary-tories\">that ground-breaking pledge made by Theresa May</a> in her brief period as a corporate reformer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>In the latest proposed tweaks to the corporate governance code, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of either consumers or workers being installed on the boards of public companies. Taking its cue from the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green paper, the Financial Reporting Council says companies can take their pick from one of three options.</p> <p>They can indeed nominate an employee to serve on the board. Or they can create an employee advisory council, if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one already. Or they can just assign a non-executive director to look out for employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interests. This third option is known as kicking the issue into the long grass. It will be popular.</p>",

Others can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stomach the personal rewards for Xstrata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass, including the \u00c2\u00a3140m retention package that executives were offered to stay after the takeover. But, remember, Davis had been interviewed and picked by the board of Rio as the frontrunner. A U-turn in these circumstances is unusual. A welcome victory for shareholder power? Up to a point. Almost everybody is in favour of big investors engaging actively with companies and, in this case, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair argument that Rio doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a swashbuckling, deal-making chairman at a moment when it is preaching a gospel of disciplined capital allocation. That, as it happens, was this column\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view a few weeks ago. But, in Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoes, you would also want to know why the Investor Forum mentioned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high personal integrity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as one of three \u00e2\u20ac\u0153key investor considerations for this appointment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That could be read as a general comment. But, in the context of the letter, it could also be taken as personal, nasty and below the belt. Davis, a well-known philanthropist, is entitled to an explanation. Stock market highs are just a sugar rush Another day, another record for Wall Street, and another chance for Donald Trump to spin the shallow idea that his presidency must be successful because stock prices are rising. The notion is shallow because cutting corporate taxes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thereby delivering an instant boost to companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was always likely to push the stock market higher. The process is almost mechanical, especially for big US-focused companies such as banks and energy companies. But, once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Workers on boards? How about a non-executive director? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recall, one last time, that ground-breaking pledge made by Theresa May in her brief period as a corporate reformer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the latest proposed tweaks to the corporate governance code, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of either consumers or workers being installed on the boards of public companies. Taking its cue from the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green paper, the Financial Reporting Council says companies can take their pick from one of three options. They can indeed nominate an employee to serve on the board. Or they can create an employee advisory council, if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one already. Or they can just assign a non-executive director to look out for employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interests. This third option is known as kicking the issue into the long grass. It will be popular.",

                "bodyText":"So, not the most convincing rally we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell the news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nils\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Getting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this bill is very dangerous,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said on CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Squawk Box\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When people lose health insurance, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re less likely to get preventive care, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more likely to die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was exceptional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d leave the Dow at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one insider. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout programme, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no divergence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued regulatory compliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far-reaching implications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently propping up Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreforms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Residential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the frontline we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbrittle, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Survey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Construction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to cut America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies\u00e2\u20ac\u201cApple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccurrently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are recovering from Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very, very happy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But...the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153once-in-a-lifetime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plan to cut taxes for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153average Americans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been criticised by experts who say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is still a way to go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report 3pm GMT: US factory orders for October",

                "bodyText":"A drop in commodity prices on concerns about Chinese growth helped push UK markets lower, while elsewhere there was a fairly mixed performance. There was little help from Wall Street which slipped back after its recent record breaking runs. The US tax reforms saw investors ditch technology shares in favour of financial and consumer companies which were more likely to directly benefit from the changes. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 11.47 points or 0.16% at 7327.50 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.08% to 13,048.54 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.26% lower at 5375.53 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.24% to 22,416.31 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.03% at 10,211.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.54% to 730.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 36 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive snapshot of the global economy from Markit: The pound is likely to fall quite a bit further if Brexit talks break down, says Capital Economics, but the extent of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline since the referendum might limit the damage. Overall the consultancy believes a favourable deal is still the most likely outcome, which should give some support to sterling. Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Oliver Jones says: We think that a transitional deal which largely preserves the status quo will eventually be reached, and a favourable agreement on the future trading relationship will ultimately be struck too. Given how investors are positioned, signs that such an arrangement is likely might not give sterling much of a lift. But we think that progress towards this type of deal would help the UK economy to hold up better than most expect. We suspect that this would prompt the Bank of England to raise rates by more than is discounted in markets, which would probably support sterling. Admittedly, we forecast that sterling will weaken a little against the dollar in 2018 as the Fed tightens by even more relative to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. But we project that sterling will strengthen against most other major currencies. Following the weaker than expected US service sector surveys, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost its early gains and dipped slightly into the red. The ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anthony Nieves said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rate of growth has lessened in the non-manufacturing sector after two very strong months of growth. Comments from the survey respondents indicate that the economy and sector will continue to grow for the remainder of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And here are some of the comments from the ISM report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Domestic business is strong, with positive growth indicators for 2018 from both internal sources and client feedback.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Construction labor continues to be constrained in the West.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Steady; no material changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to struggle with understanding the [potential] changes to the Affordable Care Act, and are trying to be flexible in how we respond. Also, Hurricane Maria has affected some of our pharmaceutical supplies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mixed bag of goods for November 2017.

After the decline in the Markit service sector survey, the Institute for Supply Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-manufacturing PMI has fallen from 60.1 in October to 57.4. This is below expectations of a level of 59. Business activity, prices paid, employment and new orders were all weaker. The first of two US service sector surveys shows a slightly larger than expected fall in November. The Markit final service sector PMI has come in at 54.5, down from 55.3 in October and below the initial estimate of 54.7. This is the lowest reading since June. The rival ISM survey is due shortly. Following the US trade data and ahead of the latest service sector surveys, US markets continue to be influenced by the Republican tax bill. Investors are moving out of technology stocks - which have been hitting new records throughout the year - and into sectors which should directly benefit from the tax measures. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 34 points or 0.17% after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record breaking run (even though the Dow came off its best levels as the trading day progressed). But the Nasdaq Composite technology index opened down 0.24% while the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said of the current trends: A major sector rotation is taking place. Money is coming out of technology sector and moving in those sectors which are going to be the beneficiary of the US tax overhaul. Hence, we have seen massive inflow of funds in the financial and consumer discretionary sector and while energy sector has experienced outflow. And over to Bitcoin, which continues to defy gravity: The cryptocurrency has hit a high of $11,850 so far today before slipping back to $11,803. Back with UK car sales, and here is our report by Angela Monagham: UK sales of new cars fell for an eighth consecutive month in November as economic uncertainty and a sharp fall in demand for diesel cars weighed on demand. Sales slumped by 11.2% last month to 163,541 vehicles, putting the industry on course for the first drop in annual sales since 2011. New car sales in the first 11 months of 2017 were down by 5% at 2.39m. The November decline was driven by a 30.6% fall in diesel sales according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which more than offset a 5% rise in petrol and 33% rise in alternatively fuelled vehicles. Companies cut back on new cars the most, with business registrations slumping by 33.6%. Private registrations fell by 5.1%, while fleet registrations dropped by 14.4%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An eighth month of decline in the new car market is a major concern, with falling business and consumer confidence exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry trade body. The full story is here: Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has widened to a nine-month high - a move that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please Donald Trump. The gap between what the US imports and exports jumped by 8.6% to $48.7bn in October, the Commerce Department says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly trade deficit since January, and $1.2bn more than economists had expected. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to rising oil, which have pushed up the cost of importing crude into America. The fall in the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value is supporting shares in London today. The FTSE 100 is the only European stock index that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost ground - as investors ponder Brexit, and the prospect of US tax reforms. Chris Weston of IG says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The two overarching macro themes the market honed in on overnight have been the response from European and U.S. traders to the Senate passing its tax plan and that no deal has yet been formally reached in the Brexit negotiations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Greece, thousands of protestors have taken to the streets to denounce the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to clamp down on the ability of unions to call strike action. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Marching through Athens to parliament, protestors accused prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 administration of treachery, saying the right to strike had been won \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with blood and sweat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Demonstrating outside the ministry of labour unionists attempted to smash windows in what witnesses described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orgy of fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the measure. The reform had been part of the policy package finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had agreed with debt-stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout creditors to conclude a compliance review that was approved by peers at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group. But the reaction has been furious and swift. With public sector employees and communist aligned unionists announcing immediate work stoppages nationwide, the labour ministry was forced into an embarrassing U-turn declaring late last night that it would amend the regulations only hours after agreeing them. The alacrity and force with which unionists have reacted has highlighted the friction the government will face in enforcing reforms that have also provoked deep unease within the ranks of the ruling Syriza party. Just hours earlier, Tsakalotos had announced in Brussels: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is really now turning the corner and I think there is a general acceptance that we are turning the corner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Davis, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary of state for exiting the EU, is answering an urgent question on the Brexit talks in parliament. Andrew Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics live blog has full details: Former transport secretary Andrew Adonis says rail passengers should blame the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote for pushing up fares. As explained earlier, the rail fares increase is linked to the retail prices index, which has been pushed up by the rising cost of imports. Lord Adonis says this means people face paying more simply to get to work (which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the voting paper on June 23rd 2016): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commuters are feeling the Brexit squeeze already, as the rise in inflation has pushed up rail fares in their highest increase for five years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no doubting the impact of the plunge in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending power. And now the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme Brexit plans, and its continued inability to make progress in the negotiations, is causing deep uncertainty and keeping our currency weak. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The Bank of England has admitted to warning UK courts to expect a deluge of insurer applications ahead of Brexit. The BoE tipped off the High Court, but kept this move private to avoid spooking policyholders - and triggering an even bigger rush to m\u00e2\u20ac\u2122learned friends. Now, though, it believes the situation is under control - so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re allowed to know about it. Press Association has the details: Minutes from a November meeting of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) show that members were given \u00e2\u20ac\u0153early estimates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd around the number of policyholders that would be impacted if insurers lost permission to collect premiums and pay out claims on cross-border contracts after Brexit. It is the latest revelation around Brexit preparations being made by both the UK Government and regulators as banks, asset managers and insurers prepare for the loss of passporting rights which currently grant cross-border access throughout the EU. In light of the potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the committee was told insurers were planning to either transfer contacts to new entities or gain new permissions for existing operations, a process that could take between 12 to 18 months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the volume of these applications was expected to be three to five times the normal level, there was a risk that transfers would not be completed in time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the FPC said. The minutes (online here) have more details. The slowdown in UK service sector growth is weighing on the pound. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.3405, as traders watch for any signs of Brexit progress. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, says: The Brexit woes were coupled with disappointing services data for November further deepening the losses and putting further downward pressure on the pound. Despite recent manufacturing and construction figures both beating previous estimates, the service PMI, although fuelled with optimism, missed expectations. Analysts have pointed out that Brexit related uncertainty and its effect on UK firms is leading cause of the sharp downtrend, painting a bleak picture of a dominant sector. Investors and pound traders are now looking towards the next big deadline at the December 14th-15th EU Summit where the EU is set to give its verdict on whether Britain can progress to discussing their future relationship. The pound will be in focus for investors over the coming days and there may be more optimism amongst investors ahead of the December EU Summit next week, however, further political doubt could signal more uncertainty for the currency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Theresa May is engaged on a high-speed diplomatic drive to resolve the Irish border crisis. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a breakthrough yet. Instead, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has argued that the UK should remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaligned\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the customs union -- that might solve the Irish border problem, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please the hard-line Brexit wing. In another worrying signal, growth in the UK service sector has slowed unexpectedly. Data firm Markit reports that the growth in business activity weakened in November, having hit a six-month high in October. Job creation was also subdued. Firms were also hit by rising costs, with energy, food and salaries all going up. In response, bosses hiked their own prices -- which is bad news for consumers. This dragged the UK service sector PMI down to 53.8, from 55.6 in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still over the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Chris Williamson of Markit says Brexit (yes again!) was one factor hitting the service sector (which makes up around three-quarters of the UK economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uncertainty about the economic outlook, linked commonly to Brexit worries, continued to permeate the business mood in November. However, for now, the survey data indicate that a sufficient degree of optimism in pockets of the economy, notably financial services, tourism, manufacturing and house building, is helping the economy as a whole to sustain steady growth. Alex Buttle, director at car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, fears that next year will be tough for the car industry. The solution? More support for the electric car industry. Buttle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Petrol sales were up last month and the year to date and AFV registrations saw another month of double digit growth, as the electric and hybrid revolution continues to gather pace. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government needs to take note, and put its full backing behind AFV progression by offering more incentives for the consumer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When it taxed diesels in the Budget, it hit the car industry in one area but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough in other areas. AFV is the future and more needs to be done to encourage car owners to switch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new car industry will go into 2018 a lot less healthy than it started the year. And with household finances likely to be stretched even more next year, there will be very little incentive for consumers to buy new. Environmental campaigners were disappointed that chancellor Philip Hammond didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t announce a diesel scrappage scheme in last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, to encourage drivers to move to electric.... So far this year, sales of Vauxhall cars are down 22%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve sold 181,834 vehicles to UK customers since the start of 2017, down from 233,881 in January-November 2016. That helps explain why PSA Group, its parent company, is cutting 400 jobs at Ellesmere Port in the North West of England. The Ford Focus hung onto its position as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular car in November: But.... sales of Ford vehicles did fall by 17% year-on-year in November. Among other major manufacturers, BMW sales fell by 16%, Audi dropped by 6.6%, Mercedes-Benz gained 6%, Volkswagen lost 2%, and Vauxhall sales slumped by 35%. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association (which represents car dealers), has welcomed the jump in electric car sales. We are pleased to see the continued increase in market share of AFVs, up 33.1% in November. The continued commitment from the Government to support the uptake of electric vehicles is extremely encouraging but we also call on the Government to do more to clarify the diesel issue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting car sales, warns Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures highlight both the cyclical and structural market challenges that the motor industry faced in November, which sees the eighth consecutive month of car registrations being in decline. Brexit is having an obvious impact on the market as a whole as consumer confidence remains low. Some of the consumers who are shunning diesel cars are buying electric models instead. Sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by a third in November, from 6,661 to 8,867 units. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5.4% of the market, up from 3.6% a year ago. This chart, from the SMMT, confirms that UK car sales are down 5% so far this year, led by a slump in demand for diesel. Breaking: UK car sales slumped by over 11% in November, led by a startling decline in diesel sales. This confirm that demand has now fallen for eight months in a row, putting the sector on track for its first annual decline since 2011. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that car registrations shrank by 11.2% in November to 163,541 units. Companies cut back the most, with business registrations slumping by 33.6%. Private registrations declined by 5.1%, while fleet registrations dropped by 14.4%. Sales of petrol sales did rise by 5%, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to counter a 30% slump in demand for diesels. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says the slump is a big worry. He blames politicians for not doing more to help diesel manufacturers, following the emissions scandal which rocked the industry and shocked consumers. Hawes says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An eighth month of decline in the new car market is a major concern, with falling business and consumer confidence exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government. Diesel remains the right choice for many drivers, not least because of its fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions. The decision to tax the latest low emission diesels is a step backwards and will only discourage drivers from trading in their older, more polluting cars. Given fleet renewal is the fastest way to improve air quality, penalising the latest, cleanest diesels is counterproductive and will have detrimental environmental and economic consequences.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More details to follow.... The European economy has enjoyed another strong month, according to new data which shows that services sector and manufacturing output is growing fast. The eurozone composite PMI, calculated by data firm Markit reports, has jumped to 57.5 for November from 56.0 in October. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since April 2011. Firms report that new orders rose strongly, encouraging them to take on more staff. Another satisfied customer: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another dark morning for UK sub-prime lender Provident Financial. Shares in Provident have plunged by almost 20%, after it warned investors that it was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the City watchdog). The FCA is investigating Provident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car financing unit, Moneybarn, over how it decided whether its loans to people with bad credit histories were affordable, and how it treated customers in financial distress. This follows two profit warnings already this year, and the sudden death of executive chair Manjit Wolstenholme last month. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the Moneybarn probe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adds to the woes for the embattled lender and is another headache for management at the worst time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rail passengers continue to fume about the prospect of next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fare hike: The pound is coming under pressure this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already shed more than half a cent against the US dollar to $1.341, having traded over $1.35 on Monday. Traders are blaming the latest Brexit crisis; Theresa May is looking more vulnerable today after the Democratic Union Party pulled the rug from under her plan to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Unions have slammed the looming hike in UK rail fares, arguing that passengers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting a good deal. RMT union general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These fare increases are another kick in the teeth for British passengers who will still be left paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on rammed-out, unreliable trains where private profit comes before public safety. The news hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been well-received by passengers either, judging by the reaction on social media: While car sales are falling, the cost of travelling on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rail network is going up! Fares are being hiked by an average of 3.4%, in line with last August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail price index (one measure of inflation). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another blow to rail passengers, as average wages are only rising by around 2.2%. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: Rail fares will rise by 3.4% in January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest increase for five years, train companies have announced. Fares for all journeys in 2018 have been published, showing an average rise slightly below the 3.6% set by the government in August for regulated fares, which include season tickets. Rail operators said it showed the industry was attempting to keep down the cost of travel. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the train companies and Network Rail, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alongside investment from the public and private sectors, money from fares is underpinning the partnership railway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term plan to change and improve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered another month of declining sales, as economic uncertainty and the diesel crisis hit demand for new motors. Industry figures due out this morning are expected to show that sales slumped in November, possibly by as much as 11%. Such a sharp decline would crush any lingering hopes that the market could avoid its first annual decline since 2011. Diesel sales are expected to bear the brunt of the decline, as the recent emissions scandal continues to hit confidence.. As Reuters explains: New car registrations in Britain fell by around 11% in November, the eighth consecutive month that sales have declined, according to preliminary numbers from an industry body. The sales have reflected caution among consumers faced by arise in inflation since the Brexit vote in 2016 and weak wage growth, as well as concerns that the government would clamp down on diesel vehicles to curb pollution. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders were expected to show diesel car sales fell sharply again. Britain will increase tax on diesel cars that do not meet more stringent emissions standards, finance minister Philip Hammond said last month. Also coming up today.... Data firm Markit is publishing its PMI reports for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to show solid growth in Europe and the UK, as CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson explains: Starting with Europe we have the latest services PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Spain, Italy, France and Germany. It is expected that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see improvements across the board with readings of 55.2, 53.4, 60.2 and 54.9, with France outperforming strongly from an October number of 57.3. On the data front, having seen two decent numbers on manufacturing and construction PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for November, it is hoped that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services number will complete a nice hat-trick, though expectations are for a bit of a slowdown from Octobers 55.6 to a number in the region of 55.2. European stock markets are expected to inch higher, after the US Dow Jones index hit another record high last night. Tech shares did fall yesterday, though, But the pound could be volatile, after Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to pull off a Brexit breakthrough yesterday floundered on the rocks of opposition from Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP.

Should this be the case, our estimated Brexit risk premium suggests it would be followed by a generally stronger GBP. We target at least 0.85 in EUR/GBP on a solution that would break current deadlock in Brexit talks.</p> <p>Time is running out but our base scenario remains that leaders will come up with a solution that satisfies EU-leaders on 14 December, moving negotiations to stage two. We continue to expect any signs of a breakthrough in negotiations between the parties to boost the GBP by decreasing the Brexit risk premium. In our view, the risk premium reflects the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, a situation that would likely be extremely negative for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook.</p> <p>If a divorce deal is reached, clearing the way for trade negotiations to start later this month, then the risk premium should be considerably smaller than it is today, as the potential negative impact on the UK economy of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU will have been much reduced. </p> </blockquote> <p>At the moment the euro/pound is at 0.88 while against the dollar, the pound is down 0.45% at $1.3382.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-06T14:26:47.316Z\">at 2.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a27f70f4cd919066cd81e1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-06T13:59:45.468Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commentators are upbeat about their latest jobs report, although there is a warning the market could overheat in 2018:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The labor market continues to grow at a solid pace,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Notably, manufacturing added the most jobs the industry has seen all year.

                "bodyText":"Bubble or not, Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still sharply higher, albeit off its record levels. It is up 8.7% at $12,696, down from the peak of 12,815 recorded earlier. And on that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It has been a nervous day for investors in equities, with markets unsettled by a range of factors, including the latest Brexit confusion, concerns about the US tax reforms and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt ceiling and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected interest rise from the Federal Reserve. But European markets ended off their worst levels, with the final scores showing: The FTSE 100 finished up 20.53 points or 0.28% at 7348.03 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.38% to 12,998.85 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down just 0.02% at 5374.35 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.49% to 22,307.28 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.27% at 10,184.0 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.4% to 727.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 29 points or 0.12%. US crude oil stocks fell by more than expected last week but after an initial rise, prices fell back again as investors focused on rising production figures. Crude inventories dropped by 5.6m barrels, more than the forecast 3.4m decline. But gasoline stocks rose by a much larger than expected 6.8m barrels, rather than the 1.7m rise which had been forecast. And crude production continued to rise, up 25,000 barrels a day and hitting a new weekly record. John Kilduff at Again Capital told Reuters: Demand for gasoline is curiously weak. And these weeks towards the end of the shopping period normally rival the summertime. So the report overall was bearish. So Brent crude is currently down 1.2% at $62.08 a barrel. Earlier the Bank of Canada held the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate at 1%, as expected. But it suggested that further rate hikes, after rises in July and September, would be required \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the bank would be cautious about assessing the outlook for the economy. Global markets have come off their worst levels but there is still a fairly downbeat mood for the most part. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE managed to shake off its early losses this Wednesday, a luxury not afforded to its European and US peers. Signs of a reversal in the mining sector, and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued problems, meant the UK index could push 0.3% higher this afternoon, once against lifting the FTSE above 7350. Sterling, meanwhile did see its situation improve, but not by much; the pound is still down 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro, with investors processing the lunchtime shock of David Davis admitting that the government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done a sector-by-sector Brexit impact assessment. While they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely erase their losses like the FTSE, some of the red mist coating the Eurozone indices has cleared as the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone on. The DAX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is now at 0.8%, compared to the 1.2% drop seen at the open, with the CAC slipping a comparatively meagre 0.2%. As for the Dow Jones, the index dipped just 0.1% points after the bell. That leaves the Dow just above 24150, around 400 points lower than Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time intraday high, and the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst price since last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Flynn-inspired panic. In terms of data, US investors got a taster of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm jobs report as the ADP reading fell from 235k in October to 190k in November. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: Speaking of Brexit, chancellor Philip Hammond is up before the Treasury Select committee and leaving the EU is obviously one of the topics. All the developments are in our politics live blog: Back with the pound, and any breakthrough in the Brexit discussions are likely to boost the currency, says Richard Falkenh\u00c3\u00a4ll, senior foreign exchange strategist at Nordic bank SEB: Despite new set-backs in Brexit talks, we think there will be a solution which will pave the way for EU leaders to initiate stage two in talks when they meet next week (14-15 December). Should this be the case, our estimated Brexit risk premium suggests it would be followed by a generally stronger GBP. We target at least 0.85 in EUR/GBP on a solution that would break current deadlock in Brexit talks. Time is running out but our base scenario remains that leaders will come up with a solution that satisfies EU-leaders on 14 December, moving negotiations to stage two. We continue to expect any signs of a breakthrough in negotiations between the parties to boost the GBP by decreasing the Brexit risk premium. In our view, the risk premium reflects the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, a situation that would likely be extremely negative for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook. If a divorce deal is reached, clearing the way for trade negotiations to start later this month, then the risk premium should be considerably smaller than it is today, as the potential negative impact on the UK economy of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU will have been much reduced. At the moment the euro/pound is at 0.88 while against the dollar, the pound is down 0.45% at $1.3382. ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commentators are upbeat about their latest jobs report, although there is a warning the market could overheat in 2018: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The labor market continues to grow at a solid pace,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Notably, manufacturing added the most jobs the industry has seen all year. As the labor market continues to tighten and wages increase it will become increasingly difficult for employers to attract and retain skilled talent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The job market is red hot, with broad-based job gains across industries and company sizes. The only soft spots are in industries being disrupted by technology, brick-and-mortar retailing being the best example. There is a mounting threat that the job market will overheat next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created 190,000 jobs last month, according to payroll operator ADP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty decent performance, and bang in line with forecasts. It suggests the US employment market remains healthy - which bodes well for the wider Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) figures on Friday. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that the NFP figures also show wage growth, otherwise Americans risk missing out on the benefits of the recovery. One rational explanation for bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent explosive surge is that investors will soon be able to trade bitcoin futures. The advent of bitcoin derivatives will open up cryptocurrencies to a wider range of investors (City trading desks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily au fait with bitcoin wallets). That could trigger a new surge of money in, right? Well, possibly. But derivative contracts can also be used to profit when an asset loses value. So they will allow traders to net that bitcoin is overvalued and heading for a crash. This chart shows how Bitcoin has surged ahead of its recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoving averages\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - a traditional measure of an asset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value. If a correction comes, it could possibly drop back to these levels..... Neil Wilson of ETX Capital agrees that futures contracts will make bitcoin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153price discovery...a lot less opaque\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People will see just how badly priced it is. At the moment it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominated by enthusiasts and speculators who want the price to go up. Once you get enough shorts and enough people taking the other side of the bet, there will have to be a significant repricing that pops the bubble. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index is now defying the global selloff, and has crept up by 10 points (or 0.15%) today. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the bunting out. The recovery is due to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness, as the lack of Brexit progress alarms traders. The ongoing row over the Irish border, and fresh signs of cabinet divisions over the EU, is causing anxiety in the markets. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA explains: Sterling had previously rallied to two month highs against the greenback on the prospect of a deal being achieved, as both parties appeared to have closed in on a financial settlement being agreed, at least in theory. As it turns out, what had been touted as being the largest stumbling block has turned out to be nothing in comparison to finding a solution to the border problem that satisfies all involved. The next week could get very tense for Theresa May and questions over her leadership are already once again being asked, providing more downside pressure on the currency. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, has tweeted a chart showing how the pound has weakened since yesterday morning: South African retail group Steinhoff International have taken an almighty dive this morning, after it shocked the markets by announcing it had discovered accounting irregularities. Steinhoff, which recently bought British budget shops chain Poundland, has called experts from PwC in to examine its books. It also announced that its chief executive Markus Jooste had resigned. Shares in Steinhoff plunged by two thirds in Frankfurt - from almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 each to below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 (qualifying them to be sold in Poundland!). Even more alarmingly, Steinhoff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds have tumbled in value, as investors worried that the company could struggle to repay its debts. (IG means investment grade, which ought to be relatively safe....) Bitcoin just struck a new record high, at $12,800. But this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascent may have left it feeling dizzy -- the cryptocurrency promptly tumbled by $500 in a minute. Ben Kumar, investment manager at 7IM, says his firm are keeping clear from bitcoin, despite its surging popularity. Look at who Bitcoin was created by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some reclusive coding genius with a specific world view. For many people that is enough to dismiss it as a nerdy niche to be ignored. Yet reclusive coding geniuses have in recent years built some of the most successful companies in the world. But with Futures on Bitcoin to be launched later this month, the question is will that be the death knell, or another leg upwards, once hedge funds/ pension funds get involved? The jury is out, but hedge funds/ pension fund involvement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily chime with those who were attracted to Bitcoin in the first place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Most stock markets around the world are down today, most currencies have dropped against the US dollar, and most commodity prices are lower too. Over in the City, shares in insurance and holiday group Saga have plunged by 25% after a shock profits warning this morning. Saga, which targets the over-50s, warned it has suffered from the collapse of Monarch Airlines this autumn. This will wipe \u00c2\u00a32m off its profits this year. Saga also told shareholders to brace for lower profits in 2018, as it throws an extra \u00c2\u00a310m into its customer recruitment efforts. CEO Lance Batchelor said Saga had faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some challenging trading conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the last quarter. Shareholders have responded by wiping out almost a quarter of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value: The pound has lost ground against other major currencies today. The selloff picked up after David Davis, secretary of state for leaving the EU, told MPs that the government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually done any sector-by-sector analysis of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Wall Street is expected to fall again when trading begins in four hours. The Dow Jones industrial average is down by 65 points in the futures market, or around 0.3%, and the S&amp;P 500 is also being called lower. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investors Services says: Markets show ever more signs of winding down for the holiday period, but continue to be buffeted into spasms of activity by the various political melodramas, which continue to pockmark this year. There are plenty of theories floating around for why the markets are down. One is that traders are banking profits after a successful year, and hunkering down until 2018. As Andrew Clarke, director of trading at Mirabaud, put it: [Investors are] locking in profits earlier than usual for the year and not opening any new positions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eventually, as profit taking subsides, buying for the new year will appear as people look toward 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another (as cited already) is that investors fear that the rally will become derailed by political developments (Events, dear boy, events!) Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, points out that the trigger could come from either side of the Atlantic: Global equity bulls were nowhere to be found during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as market players evaluated the possible impact of proposed US tax cuts. World stocks were mostly lower amid a global technology selloff, with the lack of appetite for riskier assets punishing European shares and Wall Street. Asian markets stumbled lower during early trading on Wednesday, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overnight decline. With the renewed Brexit uncertainty likely to tarnish risk sentiment further, European stocks remain vulnerable to further downside. American shares are still at risk of extending losses this afternoon, if concerns heighten over a potential US government shutdown on Friday if a spending bill is not approved. A third option: investors are starting to heed concerns that loose monetary policy and easy money have driven share prices to unsustainable levels. Top UK fund manager Neil Woodford railed against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inflated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asset prices earlier this week. He told clients that: Ten years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history. Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bitcoin going through $10,000, European junk bonds yielding less than US Treasuries, historic low levels of volatility or smart beta ETFs attracting gigantic inflows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count..... The difference between the performance of value stocks and growth stocks today, is greater than at any stage in stock market history. This chart shows what Woodford is worried about: Brexit angst is weighing on the pound again this morning, following reports of a new cabinet split. According to the Daily Telegraph, Theresa May is facing a Cabinet revolt led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who fear the Prime Minister is trying to force through a soft Brexit. This has knocked the pound back down below $1.34 this morning, down almost half a cent. As feared, European stock markets have fallen in early trading, following the losses in Asia. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 24 points, or 0.3%, partly dragged down by mining stocks following the fall in Chinese metal prices today. There are bigger declines across Europe; Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost more than 1%. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada says the markets are fretting about the US debt ceiling deadline and Brexit. Optimism on US tax reform has given way to concern on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline to avoid a government shutdown. There have been no public developments on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on the Irish border and reports suggest that EU officials are maintaining the line that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deadline of deadlines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals is this Friday. The AFP newswire has a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Technology and energy firms were the biggest losers as Asian markets tumbled on Wednesday, extending a retreat across Europe and New York. A global equity rally has hit the buffers this week as the US probe into Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged election meddling sows uncertainty, Britain struggles to reach a Brexit deal with the European Union and traders remain cautious about Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to push through tax cuts. A key drag for Asia on Wednesday was copper prices which sank more than four percent in London, having already lost about 10 percent over the previous week. Analysts blamed a pick-up in the dollar on hopes for US tax cuts. There are also worries about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on borrowing-fuelled investing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sentiment in China has turned less positive after the conclusion of the national party congress, as the deleveraging rhetoric has returned to the market, especially with regards to real estate speculation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TD Securities commodity strategist Ryan McKay told Bloomberg News. Former Republican congressman Ron Paul (a libertarian and long-time critic of central bankers) uncovered plenty of support for bitcoin among his followers: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remember to revisit this in 2027 to see who was right (Personally I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d take the 10-year Treasuries) Is Bitcoin going to keep climbing, or is a crash around the corner? Naeem Aslam of Think Markets thinks we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more record highs, as investors will soon be able to trade bitcoin derivatives (allowing them to profit without actually owning the asset itself). It appears that the momentum is unstoppable and we do think that the 14K level could reach before the bitcoin futures start trading at the CBOE which is on the 11 December. Principally, investors are thoughtful that when institutional money (hedge funds) will be involved, the chances are that the price would move higher. Large investment funds have not been able to take the piece of the pie yet and that would be their opportunity to get on board. Bitcoin futures trading on the major stock exchanges would provide more assurance for retail investors that the derivative is trading in a regulatory frame work. This would provide tail wind for bitcoin. But.... are people actually buying bitcoin to use it, or just because they think someone else will pay more for it in future? This tweet from experienced economist Stephen Koukoulas suggests the latter.... Although the markets are down, Bitcoin is maintaining its charge upwards. The cryptocurrency has gained almost 6% this morning, bursting through the $12,000 mark to hit $12,488. Quite remarkable, given it started this year at $1,000. This latest surge comes in the face of warnings that bitcoin is a speculative bubble, and signs that regulators are concerned that organised crime gangs are using it to launder money. But bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters will argue that more people are waking up to the potential of digital currencies and the blockchain. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an edgy mood in the financial markets today, as investors worry about geopolitical issues and the state of the global economy, and wonder if a correction could be looming. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei share average has suffered its biggest fall in over eight months, tumbling by almost 2%. Other Asian markets also dropped, following a selloff on Wall Street yesterday, and Europe is expected to follow today. A range of factors are being blamed - including the stalled Brexit talks, and concerns over whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms will actually deliver growth (or even be finalised at all). Another factor: the news that US President Donald Trump will recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital and set in motion the relocation of the U.S. Embassy, despite warnings that this will fuel tensions in the Middle East. Traders are also citing concerns over US politics, where a three-month suspension of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt ceiling is about to expire. That could force the US Treasury to start using \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextraordinary measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to avoid breaching the cap, which might buy a few months grace... Debt-Limit Tracker: What to Watch in Markets as Suspension Ends 2017 has been a sterling year for the markets, but some commentators suggest that the rally may be fizzling out. Michael Hewson of CMS Markets says: Having seen some decent gains so far this year there appears to be increasing evidence that markets are starting to look a little tired. The first clues appeared yesterday when US markets after racing out of the blocks on Monday found it difficult to hold onto a lot of their gains, even if the Dow did manage to finish the day higher. The S&amp;P500 on the other hand declined for the third day in succession, its worst run of losses since August. This declining momentum has been something that has been particularly notable in European markets since the peaks back in early November, and while we have managed to find some level of support for most of the past week or so, the subsequent rebounds have been getting shallower. Overnight, the latest Australian growth figures have missed expectations. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP rose by 0.6%, weaker than the 0.8% which analysts had expected. Over in China, a senior regulator warned of tougher oversight over financial markets and illegal financial dealings, helping to push shares down in Shanghai. Commodities are also having a bad day, with Shanghai copper prices falling by 3% on concerns that Chinese growth could slow next year. Investors will be looking to the latest US jobs report, to see how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared last month. Plus, the Bank of Canada will be in the spotlight as it announces its latest monetary policy decision. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: The US ADP employment report, showing how many private sector jobs were created in America last month 3pm GMT: The Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision 3.30pm GMT: US crude oil inventory figures",

                "bodyText":"Time to recap: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another riproaring day for bitcoin, as the cryprocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Starting the day at $13,600, bitcoin smashed through $14,000 for the first time ever in early European trading. By 9am in New York, it was surging through $15,000. In increasing frenzied trading, bitcoin then hit $19,000 on the coindesk exchange (although Reuters never clocked it above $15,995). It then subsided, as bitcoin exchanges admitted they were struggling to keep up with the huge trading volumes. At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prices, the total value of every bitcoin in the world is roughly equal to the market capitalisation of credit card firm Visa. The surge came despite fresh warnings that bitcoin could be a bubble. Sir Howard Davies, chair of Royal Bank of Scotland, said top central banks should cite Dante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous warning from the gates of hell - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbandon hope all ye who enter here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In the last 12 months, bitcoin has now gained around 2,000%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone from $11,000 to over $15,000 this week alone, amid signs that retail investors are piling in. Bitcoin is due to enter the mainstream next week, when clearing houses begin offering futures trading. But, several US banks are reluctant to take part, according to the Wall Street Journal. Analysts are split over whether futures trading will bring some calm to bitcoin. It could push the price down, as investors will be able to bet on a crash. But if money keeps pouring in, the price could head higher.... But investors were also reminded of the dangers of cybercrime, as a bitcoin wallet firm revealed it had been hacked. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Wall Street has just closed for the day, with small gains on the main indices. The Dow gained 70 points, or 0.3% - a performance matched by the S&amp;P 500. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose by 0.5%, partly thanks to Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Mark Hamrick,Washington bureau chief for Bankrate.com, reports that some investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy about missing out on bitcoin: Two major US banks have decided not to offer bitcoin futures trading when it launches this weekend. That follows concerns (covered in this blog earlier today) that the systems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t robust enough. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports: Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Inc. are telling customers that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer them access to the first bitcoin futures market when it goes live on Sunday, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. futures broker, will offer access but only for certain customers, a person familiar with the situation said. ABN Amro Group will be handling trades for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a small selected group of professional clients,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokeswoman for the Dutch bank said in an e-mail. Morgan Stanley and Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale SA are still evaluating their approach to bitcoin futures, other people said Thursday. CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Seth Fiegerman joined the bitcoin party last week, when he invested $100 in the digital currency. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now written a handy explainer - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack. Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product. There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone. With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer. My original $100 bitcoin purchase won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to sell at the earliest until Friday. If the price plummets before then, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m out of luck. However, Mrs Fiegerman isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed (and this is after the price went up!) City investor Justin Urquhart Stewart reports that his cabbie is interested in bitcoin.... Borrowing money to buy into a rising asset... that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the classic signs of a bubble, associated with the dreaded Minsky Moment (when prices suddenly collapse as speculators can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t service their loans) Right now, bitcoin is trading at $15,300, according to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on my Reuters terminal. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 12% today, and up over 40% since the start of the week Earlier it jumped to the brink of $16,000 (Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data shows) but was seen rather higher on some other exchanges. Some bitcoin exchanges are struggling to handle the interest today, it seems. Coinbase, the largest US bitcoin, blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrecord high traffic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for technical problems: Bitcoin wallet provider Trezor had a similar story: This may not reassure critics who wonder how the bitcoin ecosystem will cope with the next price correction..... Ian Guider of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunday Business Post spies a bubble... Speaking of volatile trading, bitcoin prices on the coinbase exchange just rocketed towards $20,000. But it swiftly slumped back to less stratospheric levels. What wild times! The bitcoin price has been particularly volatile today, as it struck a series of new highs: It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy to run a future market in such a volatile asset..... Economics professor Justin Wolfers has put his finger on the problem with bitcoin pricing - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to bet against it today. The launch of bitcoin futures markets on Sunday night will be an important moment, says Neil Wilson of City firm ETX. But he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree that letting traders bet against bitcoin necessarily means its price will fall. Wilson explains: At least with regulated futures the market ought to behave more normally than it has done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notwithstanding some pretty major spasms in the market that are likely on Sunday night and Monday morning as the contracts launch - and this would be net bearish for Bitcoin overall as it will allow proper shorting and hedging strategies. At present the only way to short is to sell your bitcoin and exit the market, a bias that favours bulls. The ability to go short creates a new dynamic in the market and may result in a significant shock to prices. The problem is anyone shorting against this headwind of rapidly rising prices needs to be able to sweat out huge potential upside. As plenty before have noted, Bitcoin might keep rising longer than shorts can stay solvent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, and the concerns building about it..... Bitcoin has been likened to Dante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inferno by the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland. As the digital currency surged above $15,000 on Thursday, Sir Howard Davies suggested it should carry a similarly apocalyptic warning for investors. Davies, a former head of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top financial watchdog, called on the Bank of England and other authorities around the world to launch a coordinated warning against the digital currency. Bitcoin has increased in value by $3,500 in the space of a week, after surging more than 900% this year. It was trading at $15,300 at lunchtime on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put up the sign from Dante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inferno \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbandon hope all ye who enter here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said speaking on Bloomberg TV, adding that the cryptocurrency appeared to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frothy investment bubble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davies argued for Threadneedle Street to take action at the same time as the US Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the European Central Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks are very anxious about it [bitcoin],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.... More here: Analyst Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that bitcoin usage isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping pace with its price: A majority of City investors think that bitcoin is an unsustainable bubble. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a survey of institutional investors, conducted by Natixis Investment Managers, which found: Institutional investors may believe bubbles have formed in both the bond (42%) and stock (30%) markets, but concerns for these traditional assets pale in comparison to the 64% who say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bubble in Bitcoins. Over on FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska has a fascinating theory to explain bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise. In short, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that certain investors have piled into bitcoin, driving its price every higher, because they plan to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it next week. Shorting becomes a serious option once the CME clearing house launches its derivatives contracts next week. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve invested the time and money to stock up on bitcoin this year, you could make immense profits if you short the cryptocurrency next week. She explains: Without the certainty of a properly regulated marketplace defending the futures side of the equation, a payoff cannot be guaranteed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the arbitrage exists in the first place: the trade cannot be exercised elsewhere in the bitcoin ecosystem because the risk of counterparty default at the first sign of distress is far too great. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d win the trade, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably lose the payout. If a regulated futures market takes that risk away, however, the trade becomes a no-brainer if not a mastermind opportunity. Which is arguably where we are now. This chart shows how the plan would play out: But.... such a plan could still go wrong. For example: The futures launch is suspended unexpectedly, perhaps due to regulatory concerns or industry pushback? The anticipated futures demand never arrives because the margin costs of holding open long positions proves to be too great and/or liquidity is so shoddy nobody can trade effectively. The cash settled return on the futures leg, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily be matched by the price achieved on the physical liquidation. More here: The smartest bitcoin trade in town? Wowzers! Bitcoin has now surged to $16,000 on one exchange: That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gained more than $3,000 since yesterday morning. In any bubble, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a moment when new investors are lured in by reports of hefty profits, helping to drive the price higher and higher. Is that where we are now with bitcoin? And how much higher will it go? Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA predict a correction is looming.... The cryptocurrency has undoubtedly come on leaps and bounds this year but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see anything move as Bitcoin has and not fear a devastating bubble bursting. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a coincidence that Bitcoin has been making headlines over the last week or so, during which time it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risen another $5,000, or 50%. If speculation is playing as big a role in the latest moves as some expect, then very interesting times may lie ahead. Although as is always the case, this could rise a lot more before the bubble bursts. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: So, where are all these people who have made fortunes out of bitcoin? The Daily Telegraph have found one - and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still just a teenager. They say: Eddy Zillan was 16 when he began investing in bitcoin, just two years later, the youthful investor estimates he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made close to a million\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from trading in various cryptocurrency. The perspicacious Ohio teenager was an early adopter of the bubble and bust digital currency, investing in 2015 when bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price was as low as $214 following a prolonged bear market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I started off with $1,000 to play around with out of my savings,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told The Telegraph. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I then acquired another $5,000 through my bar mitzvah money (in 2012). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I then invested another $6,000 through money I earned and saved from working summer jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a useful non-technical explanation of bitcoin: Anyone who bought bitcoin two weeks ago (when it was trading at $8,000) has almost doubled their money. They won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you that at your local bank! But, of course, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly why some experts fear that a speculative bubble is building. Bitcoin buyers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heeding Sir Howard Davies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning. The cryptocurrency just hit a new alltime high, at $15,200, as American traders arrive at their desks. Just in: The US jobs market remained strong last week. Just 236,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit during the seven days to 2nd December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 238,000 the previous week, and the third weekly decline in a row. Yann Quelenn of Swissbank believes bitcoin will keep climbing this month, perhaps even hitting $20,000 -- before suffering an abrupt reversal. Quelenn writes: Sheer greed is driving the cryptocurrency higher, perhaps to $20,000 per coin by Christmas. This would put Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap above $300bn, one third that of Apple! Bitcoin is unique in history, true, but a correction will likely be very tough. Two Chicago exchanges, the CBOE and the CME, will soon launch trading of cryptocurrency futures. This signals an impending stampede of institutional investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many speculators, some hedgers. Just watch the fireworks fly. Sir Howard Davies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that bitcoin is a hellish investment for the unwary is somewhat ironic, given the track record of the bank he chairs. Royal Bank of Scotland has been controlled by the UK taxpayer for nearly a decade, having been bailed out after nearly collapsing after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has made a steady stream of losses ever since, and the British government is now planning to crystallise a \u00c2\u00a326m loss when it sells its RBS shares over the next few years. Davies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blame for RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plight, as he only joined in 2015. But the legacy of the financial crisis is exactly why some people believe cryptocurrencies make a lots of sense. Workers at GE Power have just had a very nasty shock. The US company is axing 12,000 jobs across the globe in a cost-cutting drive. The move includes 1,100 workers at its UK operations, mainly in Stafford and Rugby. GE blamed falling demand for fossil fuel power plants, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!, is more optimistic about bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Yang reckons digital currencies can be a force for good in the long term. The key it to treat bitcoin as an actual currency, not an asset whose price has been driven up by speculation. As Yang put it to CNBC: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet. Personally, I am a believer in how digital currency can play a role in our society\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but for now, it seems like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more driven by the hype of investing and getting a return rather than using it as a transaction currency. The FT points out that Bitcoin has hit $15,000 on some crypto-exchanges. Look at that spread of prices, though! No wonder the US banks have concerns about bitcoin derivatives contracts hitting the markets...... Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, has issued a dire warning against investing in bitcoin. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, as bitcoin headed towards $15,000, Davies warned that the digital currency looked like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frothy investment bubble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerned that bitcoin doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really fall under any one regulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit, meaning the adults in the room aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t warning of the risks. Davies says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrational reason\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent surge: All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inferno - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbandon hope all ye who enter here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed, and it need to done by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank at the same time. So why aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central bankers acting? Davies suspects they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about being seen as luddites if they criticise digital currencies, adding: The market is telling us something about the need for new faster payments systems. [But] I personally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bitcoin in the long run. But should bitcoin actually be outlawed, as economist Joseph Stiglitz argues? No, replies Davies - if you ban bitcoin, other variants will simply take its place. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story about the problems at NiceHash: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility has hit its highest level in almost six months, as Brexit headines shunt sterling around: The old mantra Caveat Emptor goes without saying where bitcoin is concerned. Not only is its value uncertain (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigher than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be true forever), but you run the risk of losing your bitcoins to a cybercriminal. Overnight, Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of bitcoins. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to bitcoin miners who had contributed their computing power to mine bitcoins through NiceHash. Users reckon that NiceHash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bitcoin wallet had held around 4,736.42 bitcoins \u00e2\u20ac\u201d equivalent to over $66m at current prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: More reaction to Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest spike: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise looks unstoppable -- but the launch of those bitcoin futures could change things. Bitcoin bulls have driven the virtual currency beyond $14,500 for the first time. The bitcoin has jumped 20% over the last 24 hours with buyers of the virtual currency now eyeing up $20,000. Given the fact that both the CBOE and the CME exchanges will begin offering bitcoin futures this month, perhaps the prediction of $20,000 is not that far off? However, the start of futures trading also means the start of short trades on the bitcoin, which could increase volatility further. Now this is interesting. The Financial Times is reporting that some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks are resisting the imminent launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading will allow people to trade the digital currency without actually owning it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s means to open bitcoin up to a wider range of investors. However, given bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility, some industry figures fear that the clearing houses that underpins the markets could suffer massive losses if the cryptocurrency were to crash. The FT says: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset but only via a regulated market. However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by the Chicago exchanges CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, given a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, has prompted a backlash among the major brokers who backstop trading across the industry. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday. In a draft seen by the FT, the FIA writes that the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not allow for proper public transparency and input\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Newsflash: UK house prices kept rising last month, according to the latest data from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices rose by 0.5% during November, leaving them 3.9% higher than a year ago. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, says the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (well-flagged) interest rate hike last month hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked buyers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improved performance of the market in the latest quarter suggests the first interest rate rise in a decade may have ignited demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On this evidence, the November rate rise has brought prospective buyers out into the open rather than sent them underground. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many buyers may have come to the conclusion that it is better to move now while mortgage rates are still low than further down the line when they could be less competitive. Currency traders may need to don their tin hats in the coming days, as the Brexit negotiations intensify. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, predicts plenty of volatility: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Europe is the only show in town right now, and ongoing speculation around a solution to the Irish border issue has further dampened enthusiasm for sterling. A deal must be done by close of play Friday if Brexit talks are to move onto trade after next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit. Reality is, deadlines will likely get extended, whisper from Brussels will raise and dash expectations, and we may or may not get anything at the end of it. Prepare for a volatile couple of days on the currency markets. Merger news: GVC, the gambling giant behind Foxy Bingo and PartyCasino, is in talks over a \u00c2\u00a33.9bn takeover of Ladbrokes. Shares in both companies have jumped in early trading (Ladbrokes surged by over 25%). If successful, it would create one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest betting firms. Ladbrokes could welcome a takeover, given the mounting criticism over its fixed-odds betting terminals (savaged as being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrack cocaine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of gambling). The final value of the deal will partly depend on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clampdown on FOBT, which could take a chunk out of Ladbrokes profits. Geopolitical issues are high on the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: Politics will again be to the fore as UK government attempts to find some compromise on the hypersensitive issue of the Irish border, while the fall-out from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital threatens to escalate already enormous tensions across the Middle East, and quite obviously contradicts UN resolution 478. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge was remarkable, even by bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent standards: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as traders worry that Britain may not get a Brexit breakthrough before Christmas. Sterling dipped overnight to $1.337 against the US dollar, with no immediate sign of an end to the deadlock over the Irish border question. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost two cents lower than Monday, when optimism of a deal was rising. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little weaker against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.133. Tensions mounted after Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, said the UK must agree the text on a potential deal by Friday night. Otherwise, the two sides can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shift onto taking about that precious trade deal. Time is running short, as analysts at FxPro warn this morning.... If talks do not move on to the next stage of discussions in December then the terms of a transition period will likely be pushed back until the next European council summit of leaders in March, by which time many businesses in the UK will have had to make decisions over their location and investments in the country. So, the City is looking to Westminster for some serious progress between the UK government, the DUP (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Northern Irish partners) and Dublin. But if each side sticks to its principles, this will be tough - so sterling could have a choppy ride. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to soar at an ever faster rate. The digital currency battered its way through the $14,000 mark overnight, having hit $12,000 yesterday. More consumers are jumping into bitcoin - presumably having heard stories of its rapid ascent. Institutional investors are also taking more interest, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon be able to buy and sell bitcoin derivative contracts. It will intensify the argument between those who think bitcoin is a monetary paradigm shift, and those who see a dangerous bubble. Par example: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching out for new UK house price figures, updated eurozone growth stats and the weekly US unemployment report: The agenda 8.30am GMT: Halifax UK house price survey for November 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP statistics for Q3 2016 (second estimate) 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless claims 4pm GMT: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks at a press conference held by the Bank for International Settlement.",

The group said the exchanges should have sought more industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits and stress tests for the system before beginning trading.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story in bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut on the futures markets, and the latest warnings that the crypto-currency is a speculative bubble: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW As the first day of bitcoin derivatives trading draws to a close, forecasts that it would trigger an immediate wave of selling look wide of the mark. The January 2018 futures contract is trading close to its earlier highs, at around $18,300. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from an opening price of $15,000, and ahead of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 price - which is closing in on $17,000 tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation in Chicago: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick explanation of bitcoin futures: Edward Tilly, chairman and chief executive officer at Cboe Global Markets, has spoken to Bloomberg TV about the bitcoin futures launch today. Tilly says it has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business as usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with more than 3,000 bitcoin contracts sold on Cboe as market participants get up and running. Apparently there were just 12 registered traders involved with the bitcoin futures market at launch - that has risen to 22 during the trading day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly small pool of traders, frankly, given all the interest in digital currencies. I suspect major investors are treating bitcoin cautiously today, as they watch events unfold.... Just because you can do something, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you should do, right? That mantra applies to bitcoin futures trading as much as anything else. So before you take the plunge, check out Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-point list of stuff you need to know: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: 5. What are the risks? Not everyone thinks derivatives based on bitcoin are ready for prime time. One worry is the volatility that so far has been a key feature of the digital currency market. Just three days before Cboe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product was slated to be introduced, bitcoin had one of its wildest sessions ever: On Coinbase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes, before crashing back down. 6. So are bitcoin futures a bad idea? Some big traders think futures may be premature. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. In an open letter to the exchanges, the group questioned whether they would be able to adequately police market manipulation in bitcoin. The group said the exchanges should have sought more industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits and stress tests for the system before beginning trading. Cboe and CME are requiring traders to set aside an unusually large pile of cash to serve as collateral to back purchases. The full article is online here. My colleague Alex Hern has written a handy guide to other digital currencies which might (or might not!) rival bitcoin one day. He insists that it must not be taken as investment advice. And this snippet explains exactly why: PlexCoin, an innovative attempt to build \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the next decentralised worldwide cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, has already raised $15m from backers, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better move fast to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ah, hang on. No. The founder has just been sent to jail for two months for, among other things, falsehoods on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundraising documents, as well as taking investor money and using it to fund home improvement..... Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons the launch of bitcoin futures has gone pretty smoothly - even though only a few thousand contracts have actually been sold so far today. There are nearly 2900 contracts which have traded for the month of January which by no means can be classified as an anaemic volume but not exactly explosive either. The thought that comes to mind is that the Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spot and futures markets seem stable for now and things are looking much calmer. The spread between the February and January contract has narrowed to $150 which at one point was as high as $2000. This confirms that the volatility has eased off massively and in the coming days, we would not be shocked if the margin requirements are even lowered and the transaction cost reduced. By its recent standards, bitcoin has been notably stable today. The digital currency has been trading around at $16,300 mark for most of the day, a gain of around 10%. The futures contract has been more volatile, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might have been.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only money, eh? Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Richard Beales has calculated that the volume of bitcoin future contracts actually traded today is quite modest. He writes: The one-month future surged more than 20 percent from the open before trading below $18,000 on Monday morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still a premium to the crypto-currency itself. Considering the price of bitcoin has risen two-thirds this month alone, that seems fairly sedate. Volume was roughly $50 million, Breakingviews calculates, less than 0.5 percent of actual bitcoin trading in the prior 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com. But the market could develop fast, as the CME exchange plans to rival CBOE by launching its own futures trading next Monday. Beales adds: Proponents reckon the entry of two big, regulated U.S. exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring bitcoin exposure to retail investors. Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearing houses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and their customers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can now ride the bitcoin bandwagon without touching the crypto-currency at all. Despite its bumpy start, the new bitcoin futures contract is still trading at a higher level than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bitcoin. That shows the people trading this new futures contract expect bitcoin to keep rising in value over the next few weeks: However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days - many major banks are still wary of cryptocurrencies, and have resisted offering bitcoin futures to their own clients. Potential short-sellers (who want to bet against bitcoin) could still be lurking out there... Wall Street has begun the new week calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising by 25 points, or 0.1%, in early trading. Some bitcoin supporters argue that digital currencies could replace gold as a store of value. Now there are signs that investors are selling their gold-backed securities to buy bitcoin instead.... Time for a quick recap, for any US readers joining us (it just turned 7.30am in New York). Bitcoin has taken another step towards the financial mainstream, with the launch of its first derivative contracts in Chicago. But the move has intensified concerns that cryptocurrencies should be tightly controlled, in case they prove to be an unsustainable speculative bubble that ends in tears. The first Bitcoin futures contracts, which will be settled in early 2018, jumped by 25% in early trading overnight -- triggering two circuit-breakers designed to calm volatile markets. Although the number of futures contracts traded was relatively small, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut seems to be going relatively smoothly. These futures contracts can be used to bet against bitcoin, but Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest pricing, via Reuters: The one-month future is up 13% from the open at $17,450, around $1,000 higher than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bitcoin price - the price at which bitcoin is currently being bought and sold. The two-month contract is trading at $18,880, while the three-month contract is changing hands at $19,040. Some analysts think the launch of bitcoin futures will legitimise the digital currency as an asset class -- it has already jumped by more than 1,500% this year. But there is also concern that it is being fuelled by unsustainable speculation - and that small investors are being lured to buy bitcoins because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard it keeps going up. UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Donovan recommends keeping well away, arguing that bitcoin is a bubble whose eventual puncturing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be predicted. There are also signs that the political and economic establishment is becoming more concerned. A senior ECB policymaker, Ewald Nowotny, has called for greater scrutiny of bitcoin to prevent it being used for moneylaundering. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has also voiced concerns that bitcoin isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being regulated properly. And yesterday, New Zealand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief suggested bitcoin looked \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremarkably\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like a bubble. A senior policymaker at the European Central Bank has called for bitcoin to be more tightly controlled, to avoid it being used by organised criminals. Ewald Nowotny, who is also Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, said that the recent jump in bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value means tighter controls are needed. Nowotny told a press conference in Vienna this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Simply because of the scale, it is certainly increasingly necessary to discuss whether and in what form regulations are needed here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A particular aspect that needs to be discussed ...is the question of how far the regulations on money laundering ...are relevant here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch of the first bitcoin futures contract could pave the way for other financial products based on cryptocurrencies. Daniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, says bitcoin is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gaining more and more legitimacy as an asset class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has the potential to add further momentum and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency to both institutional and retail investors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a matter of fact, the introduction of derivatives provides the necessary market structure for institutions to trade on Bitcoins without owning them as, in fact, futures contracts on Bitcoin are cash settled. This will likely lead to the creation of ETFs and other more liquid instruments, potentially increasing market activity and aggregate demand by orders of magnitude. But Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known fund manager is seriously unhappy about the bitcoin boom. Neil Woodford has dismissed bitcoin as a modern tulip bulb, saying his firm are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggling to find a sensible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explanation for the cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in value this year. Bitcoin is hogging most of the action in the financial markets today. In the City, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points - or 0.6% - in a gentle trading session. European markets are more subdued, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index as flat as un cr\u00c3\u00aape. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx comments: While investors go doolally for bitcoin futures, the more traditional markets were pretty dreary this Monday. The jump in bitcoin futures today has calmed fears of a crash, says Craig Erlam of OANDA: Bitcoin is back trading near record highs this morning, allaying fears for now that the ability to short would trigger a sell-off. The price of a Bitcoin future has dropped back from its early high, but is still up around 17% today. Associated Press has the details: At 3:40 a.m. central time (0940 GMT) on Monday, the futures contract that expires in January was trading at $17,600. It opened at 5 p.m. CST at $15,000 and climbed as high as $18,700 in its first day of trading, according to CBOE Global Markets. We have an early candidate for quote of the day, via Bloomberg. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is rare that you see something more volatile than bitcoin, but we found it: bitcoin futures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia. Derivatives allow traders to take a negative view of bitcoin, and profit if its value falls. But... they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also a way for institutional investors to back digital currencies without having to get to grips with the technical intricacies (such as multiple exchanges, wallets, and occasional reports of bitcoins being stolen by cybercriminals). Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investors, reckons that these new futures contracts could unleash a new flow of funds into bitcoin: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a dull moment where cryptocurrencies are involved. Introducing a bitcoin futures contract in the US gives professional investors and institutions an easier route in, and a fresh surge in value indicates pent up demand. Anything that adds to the asset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accessibility and legitimacy and reduces security risk often associated with cryptos will improve its credentials as a tradeable asset and so grow the pool of potential investors. Already, rapid and substantial gains on cryptocurrency exchanges have drawn in even seasoned investors, who are now earmarking some portfolio cash for bitcoin. Opportunities to profit from such extreme market conditions, akin to the dotcom boom, are rare indeed, but inevitably come loaded with risk. However, the music may have much longer to play on this one than people think. At around $16,400, Bitcoin has surged by over 1,500% since the start of 2017. That means the combined value of every bitcoin currently in existence is around $274bn -- or more than most major companies (it overtook JP Morgan last week, for example). So would a crash destabilise the financial markets? Not according to Capital Economics, who point out: If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller But... a major correction could have a damaging knock-on effect if people have borrowed heavily to buy bitcoin, in the hope of making quick gains. Our technology writer Alex Hern has been pondering bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, and tweets: South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has revealed today that his government is reviewing whether bitcoin trading should be subjected to fresh regulation. Kim Dong-yeon told reporters in Seoul that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at its speculative nature, as well as the situation in other countries.... Bitcoin regulation has rocketed up the news agenda in recent weeks, as its price has surged. Last week, it emerged that the UK Treasury was examining whether laws against money laundering should be updated to specifically cover virtual currencies. UBS analyst Paul Donovan has a word of caution for those thinking of betting against bitcoin. Previous bubbles have lasted longer than critics have expected, Donovan points out. So unless you get your timing right, you could be crushed under the stampede of speculative money pushing an asset higher and higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how Donovan explains it: Should investors bet against the bubble? That is high risk. UBS believes cryptocurrencies are a bubble. However, being able to short a bubble does not make the bubble burst at once. Cash settled futures contracts on tulip bulbs began in Holland in 1636. The tulip bubble did not burst until February 1637. Bubbles are by definition irrational. Predicting when a bubble will burst cannot use rational analysis. Ignoring a bubble is the best course of action. Or, as John Maynard Keynes put it, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new bitcoin futures contracts have attracted more attention than expected, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: The initial reaction was beyond expectations with the futures contract climbing more than 20% and triggering two trading halts. CBOE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website experienced unprecedented traffic which may well have sent a new benchmark; the frenetic activity led to delays and outages. So far, it seems professional investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to bet against the bitcoin, despite the many warnings of a bubble that will burst soon. Many traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even interested in the price direction, but the listing of the futures contract on CBOE and later next week on the CME, will provide them an arbitrage trading opportunity due to the vast pricing differences. However, the arbitrage trading will lead to improved price efficiency and probably less volatility. After volatility settles down, the focus will return to the price direction. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally comes in the face of another warning that the cryptocurrency is a speculative bubble that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end well. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting governor Grant Spencer warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the centuries we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen bubbles, and this appears to be a bit of a classic case. With a bubble, you never know how far it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go before it comes down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In theory, the launch of derivative contracts today should help bitcoin find its true value (as investors will now be able to bet against it)..... Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories, believes bitcoin futures trading will take a few days to bed down. Gottlieb says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if there is an institution or institutional-sized trader out there, they are going to want to make sure that the mechanics work first, just for the futures. I think the excitement will come when the futures market is established. That can take a few days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already plenty of interest -- Bitcoin futures have surged by a quarter since trading began late last night. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: CBOE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s circuit breakers have been busy this morning, as bitcoin futures trading began. Bloomberg explains: The first trading halt came about 2 1/2 hours after the session began, while the second one triggered after four hours. Cboe imposes circuit breakers to curb volatility, halting transactions for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and for five minutes at 20 percent. Trading will stop for at least five minutes if the rally extends to 30 percent, Cboe said in a notice on its website. Good morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a red letter day for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency makes its long-anticipated debut on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures market. For the first time, institutional investors can bet on whether bitcoin will continue to rise in value, or crash back to earth. This could be a watershed moment for digital currencies, moving them closer to the mainstream. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already a surge of interest in bitcoin this morning, since the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) launched its futures contract. Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price has surged by up to 25%, forcing CBOE to temporarily halt trading - twice! - to let the volatility cool off. Dealers reported that there is more interest than expected, with a torrent of traffic hitting CBOE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. Once the situation calmed down, Bitcoin futures expiring in January are changing hands at $17,780 - up from an opening level of $15,000. That surge in value has pushed bitcoin futures way ahead of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 price of bitcoin -- ie, how much you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to pay for one right now. In other words, investors are anticipating that bitcoin will keep pushing higher. Several major banks have approached the launch of bitcoin futures cautiously, given concerns over the validity of cryptocurrencies. As Associated Press put it: Many larger Wall Street brokerages and clearinghouses, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are either not allowing customers to trade bitcoin futures or only allowing select clients to do so. Other brokerages are putting restrictions on the amount of margin a trader can use in bitcoin futures, or putting limits on the amount that can be purchased. The digital currency has had more than its fair share of critics on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a fraud.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas Peterffy, chairman of the broker-dealer Interactive Brokers Group, expressed deep concerns about the trading of bitcoin futures last month, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is no fundamental basis for valuation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they may assume any price from one day to the next.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it could be a volatile day, as traders in London trudge through the snow and sleet to their desks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic calendar. European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, with the FTSE 100 being called up around 31 points. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the economic and financial news through the day.",

                "bodyText":"A late ps: petrol prices may rise by 3p per litre, due to the production freeze caused by the cracked Forties North Sea oil pipe, and the serious explosion in Austria today. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains; The RAC has warned British drivers they could be paying 3p a litre more for fuel by Christmas after the shutdown of a major North Sea pipeline hit oil prices. The warning came as an explosion at a key European gas hub in Austria and disruption to supplies in Norway pushed gas prices to multi-year highs. The price of unleaded could climb to 123.76p a litre and diesel to 126.21p a litre, the highest since November 2014, the RAC said.... Bad news for motorists, as this puts extra pressure on the cost of living. Goodnight! Right, time for a recap...via our own Larry Elliott: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze has intensified after the annual rate of inflation hit a near six-year high of 3.1% in November. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed dearer computer games and a smaller fall in airfares than a year ago were two factors behind the unexpected increase from 3% in October. The small increase in the cost of living will force Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street has failed to keep inflation within one percentage point of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. A breakdown of the ONS data showed food prices up by 4.1% on a year ago, with transport costs rising by 4.5% and clothing and footwear up by 3%. The fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 has been the main factor behind the jump in the annual inflation rate from 1.2% in November 2016 to its highest level since March 2012. City analysts believe inflation is close to a peak but evidence that there may be more inflationary pressure in the pipeline emerged from separate ONS figures for producer prices, which measure the cost of the fuel and raw materials used by industry and the price of goods leaving factory gates. In November, fuel and raw material bills for manufacturers were 7.3% higher than a year ago, up from 4.8% in October, while factory gate prices rose by 3%, up from 2.8% in October. More here: NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, Amit Kara, fears that British workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay packets will remain under the cosh for some time: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect inflation to peak at current levels in the final quarter of this year before dropping back to the target rate by mid-2019. The Bank will in our view raise the policy rate every six months until the policy rate reaches 2% by mid-2021, with the next increase in May. Wage growth is likely to remain under pressure as a result\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The energy market has been rocked by a major explosion at Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main gas line. One person has reportedly been killed in the blast, which occurred around 8.45am local time, with 18 people injured. The pipeline supplies gas to Italy, which has been forced to declare a state of emergency: This comes a day after a crack forced the closure of a major oil pipeline from the North Sea (as covered earlier this morning). This supply disruption has sent the cost of natural gas for delivery today into Britain soaring , by up to 40%: Just in: Inflation may be building in America too. Producer prices (what companies charge for their wares) rose by 0.4% last month, faster than expected. On an annual bases, producer prices are up by over 3%. Instead of battling inflation, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been busy fighting another noble course - climate change. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has announced growing global support for a new initiative designed to help pave the way to a low-carbon economy by persuading firms to come clean about their exposure to climate-change risks. Speaking at the One Planet Summit in Paris, Carney said he was delighted that 237 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $6.3tn (\u00c2\u00a34.7tn) were now backing the scheme. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six leading banks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have all supported the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, set up by Carney in his role as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, an international body charged with preventing a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis. Under the plan, companies pledge to use their financial reports to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to global warming under a range of different scenarios. Banks are obliged to say how much they have lent to companies with climate-related risks. ONS Head of Inflation Mike Prestwood has summed up this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CPI inflation edged above 3% for the first time in nearly six years, with the price of computer games rising and airfares falling more slowly than this time last year. These upward pressures were partly offset by falling costs of computer equipment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prices of raw materials and goods leaving factories continued to increase as oil and petrol prices continued to rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Annual rises in house prices and rents continued to slow, with London seeing house price falls for the second month running.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While inflation has risen, house price inflation in the UK has dipped slightly - due to a slowdown in London. The average house price increased by 4.5% in the year to October 2017, down from 4.8% in September 2017. In London, prices were only 2.1% higher than a year ago. Rising inflation is a severe blow to families who rely on state benefits. Many of those benefits are currently frozen under the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme, which means they are shrinking in real terms. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, say the government should rethink its policy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Falling wages and frozen benefits mean that many families will struggle to find the money to keep up with rising inflation. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update means that a family of four on the minimum wage will be \u00c2\u00a3500 worse off every year due to the benefit freeze. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost of basic essentials is rising even faster than the headline inflation figure: food is up 4.1% and energy 6.4% in the last year. This means people on lower incomes are being hit particularly hard as they need to use more of their income to cover these costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benefits freeze was a policy introduced at a time of zero inflation. The Government should help people in poverty by ending the freeze and keeping benefits in line with the rising cost of living.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney needs to give his letter to Philip Hammond plenty of attention, as parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee are planning to grill him about it next year. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation rising faster than earnings is squeezing household finances, driven in part by rising prices for household essentials such as food and transport. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Governor will now have to write to the Chancellor to explain why the Bank has missed its inflation target by more than one per cent, and what action the MPC intends to take. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee will scrutinise that letter in its regular hearings with the Bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The TUC have created a useful, and frankly depressing, chart showing how food prices have risen over the last year. Disappointingly, we must wait until February 2018 to see Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter to Philip Hammond explaining why inflation has missed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. But how can the Bank of England governor defend this failure? Craig Inches, Head of Short Rates and Cash at Royal London Asset Management, thinks Carney should come out fighting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Brexit uncertainty still weighing heavy on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts, we think Mr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words are much more likely to be a robust defence of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing position than any plea to the Chancellor to forgive the MPC for its sins in allowing inflation to run away with itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, reckons the Bank of England will feel justified in having raised interest rates last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer prices rose relatively strongly in November, bringing inflation to 3.1% from a year earlier, and requiring the Governor of the Bank of England to write a letter to the Chancellor explaining the divergence of over 1 per cent from the inflation target. The rise is likely to embolden earlier actions by the Monetary Policy Committee to raise rates for the first time in over ten years last month. Economist Shaun Richards argues that Carney actually caused the jump in inflation, by easing monetary policy after the Brexit vote: Gavin Jackson of the Financial Times thinks Carney should simply blame the exchange rate: Edmund Greaves of Moneywise thinks the whole practice is rather outdated: Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, argues the Conservative government must take the blame for allowing wage growth to lag behind inflation. Dows says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in inflation to its highest level in over five-and-half years is extremely concerning, and once again reveals that after seven years of Tory economic failure, this Government has no answers to the problem of wages continuing to fail to keep up with prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that there will be millions of working families who will be struggling this Christmas already as a direct result of government policies such as the benefits freeze and the public sector pay cap; this is a further reminder of just how bad this double whammy of rising prices and Tory austerity policies will be this month for them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will ensure working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards are protected with a Real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour, ending the public sector pay cap, and by building a high wage, high skill economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, says he understands that Britons are suffering from rising inflation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is expected to fall over the coming year, but I recognise families are feeling a squeeze now. We are determined to help, which is why the Autumn Budget cut income tax, boosted basic pay by more than inflation and froze alcohol and fuel duties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound initially jumped when the inflation figures were released, as foreign exchange traders swiftly calculated that it made an interest rate rise more likely. But that effect didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long. Sterling is now down around 0.15% against the US dollar and the euro. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says City traders are focusing on Brexit again. In particular, comments from European Parliament chief Guy Verhofstadt criticising UK Brexit secretary David Davis: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains from the release were extremely short lived, and the pound is now once again under pressure after Guy Verhofstadt made comments about David Davis scoring an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153own goal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Brexit deal. The last hour of price action demonstrates quite clearly that for sterling, Brexit is still the only game in town.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation squeeze may actually intensify over the festive period, warns Ben Edwards, Portfolio Manager at investment giant BlackRock: UK households may have to continue to endure higher costs in some segments over Christmas particularly as food retailers continue to pass on higher producer prices and airfares take their normal seasonal trip north. But Edwards also predicts that inflation will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdrift lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the impact of the weak pound will eventually drop out of the data (as inflation compares today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prices against the same items a year ago). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance of UK wages catching up with inflation in the next few months, warns Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. Sentance also blames the weak pound for pushing up the cost of living, saying: The fall in sterling since the Brexit vote continues to push up the prices of imported goods and the strength of the global economy is also contributing to upward pressure on food and energy prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are probably close to the peak for inflation now, but it will only fall back gradually next year. That means price rises will continue to run ahead of pay growth in the first half of 2018 - continuing the squeeze on real incomes and consumer spending. That is likely to continue to act as a dampener on economic growth in the next few quarters. With inflation rising, shoppers need to be particularly savvy this Christmas, warns Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk. She says people should pay particular attention to rising food costs, or risk a nasty shock at the till. With inflation now at a 6 year high there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escaping the fact the luxury of low inflation is over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost of food, non alcoholic beverages, transport and fun activities are creeping up so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not careful your household finances could be stretched. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For many of us prices are rising faster than our wages and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in one of the most expensive times of year so budgeting is the key to beating the squeeze on your wallet. Digging into the inflation report, you can see that the cost of bread has jumped by 5.3% in the last year. Butter is up by over 21% - enough to make any late-breakfasting readers splutter over their toast. Imported lamb has risen by over 12% in the last year (compared to just 3.2% for home-reared animals), and fresh fish is 11.2% more expensive than in November 2016. Coffee was 10% more expensive than a year ago, but tea prices were virtually flat, according to the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data (online here). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail (the final column shows the change in pricing over the last 12 months; alongside is the monthly change) This latest rise in inflation shows that Britain is still suffering from the plunge in the pound after the Brexit vote in June 2016. As Maike Currie of Fidelity puts it: Just two years ago, Mark Carney was writing his fourth letter to former Chancellor, George Osborne to explain why prices were in deflationary territory. But in the past year, British households have suffered an ongoing pinch on their spending power since sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit-induced slum Channel 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Siobhan Kennedy also blames the weak pound for driving up the cost of imports such as oil. The jump in the cost of food and fuel in the last year will hit the eldest and most vulnerable particularly hard, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures shows that food and non-alcoholic drink prices have jumped by 4.2% in the last 12 months. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says this will hurt families this Christmas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christmas dinner is going to be a lot more expensive this year. Food prices have gone up at twice the rate of wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is failing to deal with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis. Working people need a pay rise. They shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about putting the turkey on the table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to see inflation over 3% either: The jump in UK inflation in November is a nasty shock for City economists, who had hoped that it might have peaked in October (at 3.0%). Aberdeen Standard Investments Chief Economist Lucy O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is slightly higher than expected and will prompt a letter from Bank of England Governor Carney to the Chancellor, explaining why inflation has overshot its target by this margin and what the Bank will do about it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall. So this could encourage the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently just 0.5%). O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll adds: The Bank of England has a tricky tightrope to walk. Too much inflation could threaten the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility and therefore its grip on the economy. But they need to keep consumer spending, the engine of the UK economy, chugging along too. If inflation keeps creeping up, or remains elevated, then the chances of the engine sputtering rise incrementally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has been driven up to 3.1% by transport costs, food, and recreational spending (such as computer games): This charts shows the details: Breaking! UK inflation has hit its highest level in almost six years, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze continues to bite. The consumer prices index rose by 3.1% in the 12 months to November, the highest level since March 2012. Air fares were the biggest factor behind the jump, according to the Office for National Statistics, along with recreational and cultural goods and services such as computer games. With UK earnings only rising by around 2.1% to 2.2% in recent months, this means households are still suffering falling real wages in the run-up to Christmas. This will also force Bank of England governor Mark Carney to write a letter to chancellor Philip Hammond to explain why inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close to its 2% target. More to follow! Talk about bad timing, eh? Ineos only took ownership of the Forties pipeline from BP in late October. The discovery a crack in the pipe must be a nasty shock to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management, and might trigger a heated conversation with BP HQ. Still, buyer beware and all that.... Tim Crotty, director of INEOS, is discussing the pipeline crack on Bloomberg TV now. Crotty explains that the crack is five or six inches long, having widened over the weekend. It simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible to put a clamp over this section (similar to a bike inner tube puncture repair), so pipe-owner Ineos must now fabricate a new section and carry out a replacement. Crotty says that the shutdown is the safest option, both for its own workers and families who live near the pipeline. In a few days, Ineos should know exactly how long the pipeline will be closed for, but it will probably be two or three weeks. The pipeline normally carries 450,000 barrels of oil per day, so shippers must now find alternative arrangements to get crude to refineries, Crotty explains. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that the UK won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run short of oil. However, he also confirms that oil rigs that use the Forties platform are being badly affected (as they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get their crude to shore by other means). This is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very expensive for Ineos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and also its suppliers, Crotty adds, so the repair will happen as quickly (and safely) as possible. The cost of wholesale gas in the UK has jumped by almost 6% this morning, reports Reuters: BRITISH WHOLESALE WITHIN-DAY GAS PRICE NOW RISING 5.9 PERCENT TO 72.00 PENCE PER THERM The impact of the Forties pipeline shutdown is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrippling through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 world energy markets, says Bloomberg. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the North Sea is a major oil supplier, and also because Brent crude is a key benchmark of energy prices. They explain: The U.K. link is critical because flows through it make up the single largest constituent part of so-called Dated Brent crude, which helps settle more than half the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical oil prices. It feeds the Hound Point export terminal near Edinburgh in Scotland and handles supplies from over 80 fields, and the shutdown forced Apache Corp.to suspend operations at its nearby Forties asset. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than just a supply disruption because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more significant as a price maker,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Olivier Jakob, an analyst at Petromatrix GmbH who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based near Zug in Switzerland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing which is the volume of oil which is lost, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a key price benchmark.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Alex Lawler reckons this is the first complete shutdown of the Forties pipe in around six years: But it could be even worse, points out Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets The UK government has insisted that oil supplies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be affected by the Forties pipeline shutdown. A spokeswoman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no security of supply issue for fuel or gas supplies as a result of the repairs needed to the Forties pipeline. The government will continue to liaise with industry operators to monitor the situation to ensure repairs are undertaken as quickly as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Martin Baccardax of financial news site The Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced: The gap between Brent crude and US oil (WTI) has now widened to over $7 per barrel, a level last seen in August 2015, say analysts. This shows that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supply disruptions can no longer be ignored in tight markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy correspondent Adam Vaughan on the Forties pipeline outage Fiona Legate, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, even if only temporarily, would have wide-reaching implications the UK oil and gas industry. Apache, a Texas-based company with operations in the North Sea, said it had ceased production as a result. The Health and Safety Executive said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to monitor the situation, as we have since we were made aware of the issues with the pipeline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The shutdown will be a serious blow for Ineos, which only completed its \u00c2\u00a3200m purchase of the pipeline system from BP at the end of October. The company had said that it was now the only UK company with refinery and petrochemical assets that were integrated in the North Sea, and would serve as a platform for more investments in the region. The cost of Brent crude oil has hit its highest level since June 2015, after one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important oil pipelines was unexpectedly shut. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchairline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crack has been discovered in the Forties pipeline, which carries crude from the North Sea oil to Grangemouth in Scotland. Its operators, INEOS, have been forced to suspend pumping while they try to fix the problem, which is overland near Netherley, south of Aberdeen. The shutdown could last three weeks -- just as Britain enters a period of rather cold and frosty weather. More than 80 platforms use the Forties pipeline, so may have to pause production while Ineos tackles the problem, which was detected after a small seepage of oil was spotted. The news has sent Brent spiking to a new 2.5 year high of $65.70 per barrel, as analysts warned that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy industry could be seriously affected by the outage. That could push up the cost of heating and petrol in Britain - and potentially drive inflation even higher.... More to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze will be in focus again this morning, when November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data is released. Prices are likely to have jumped by around 3% over the last 12 months, matching October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, and meaning that inflation is still accelerating ahead of wage growth (which is around 2.1% at present). Bad news for families in the run-up to Christmas. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a chance that higher petrol prices will have driven the Consumer Prices Index up to 3.1%, which would be a new five-year high. That would force Bank of England governor Mark Carney to write a letter to chancellor Philip Hammond explaining why inflation is racing over the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. The Office for National Statistics will also release its latest house price figures. In previous months they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shown a slowdown in London, as the rest of the country catches up with the capital. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep an eye on bitcoin, after the cryptocurrency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut on the futures market yesterday.

Unemployment, meanwhile, continued to fall, and now stands at 4.3%.

This is encouraging, but should be viewed alongside two further observations. First, wage growth remains well below the rate of growth of prices, so real wages continue to fall. Secondly, the single-month figure, while less reliable, is more modest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has fallen to 2.3% from 2.8% last time around.</p> <p>So the growth in the three-month measure is largely due to a spike in September that has not fed through into October.

                "bodyText":"Right, time for a recap. Evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long jobs boom has come to an end has emerged after official figures showed the number of people in work fell by 56,000 in the three months ending in October. After an upswing stretching to 2012, the Office for National Statistics said the employment rate had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 75.1%. Unemployment also decreased by 26,000 to 1.43 million, but only because of a rise in economic inactivity, a category that counts people who have ceased to look for work. The jobless rate remained at 4.3%, its lowest since 1975. The ONS also reported a slight pickup in earnings growth, but the 2.3% annual increase in the three months to October still meant pay was lagging behind inflation. ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment stayed close to its record high and while up on a year ago, declined compared with the previous three months. Unemployment also fell, but there was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job. Meanwhile the number of vacancies continues to grow, reaching a new record high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been a slight pick-up in pay growth in cash terms, which means that although earnings are still growing less than inflation, the gap has narrowed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Experts have pointed out that Low-paid workers are suffering particularly badly More young people have dropped out of the labour market altogether Vacancies are at a record high, suggesting firms are struggling to find qualified workers Real wages have now fallen for eight months in a row. But economists also hope that the squeeze in real income may end early next year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the data That may be all for today! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW In another worrying move, the number of young people who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in work or education has risen in the last quarter. Dr Carole Easton OBE, the chief executive of the Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust, says many aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receiving the support they need to get into work. \u00e2\u20ac\u015326,000 more young people are now economically inactive and out of education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a dramatic increase on the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women in particular are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by a lack of convenient childcare and support. While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, 346,000 young women who are not included in the numbers are being left jobless and forgotten. These charts show the situation: The opposition Labour party has dismissed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument that the UK labour market is strong. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures are further evidence of Tory economic failure, only a day after inflation rose to its highest level in over five-and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both employment and real wages are falling, while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eight million people in working households live in poverty, and many will struggle this Christmas as a direct result of this Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity policies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashwin Kumar, Chief Economist at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data - and discovered that low-paid workers are suffering particularly badly from the weak pay growth. Kumar says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages are yet again rising more slowly than prices. Combined with frozen benefits, 2017 has been a year of stress for family finances. But people working in retail and hospitality, who already face low wages, are being hit particularly hard. In real terms, earnings have fallen by 1.4% since last year in these sectors, compared to a 0.4% fall for the average worker. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that the unemployment rate for women has hit a record low, at just 4.1%. In contrast, 70.8% of women aged from 16 to 64 were in work, up from 69.8% for a year earlier. There has been an increase in women working full-time and part-time (unlike men, where the part-time cohort shrank in the last quarter). The Office for National Statistics says: The increase in the employment rate for women over the last few years has been partly due to ongoing changes to the State Pension age for women, resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, also suspects that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is stalling. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures suggest the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment engine has begun to splutter. The fall in the total number of people in work, down 0.2%, is primarily driven by a fall in full-time self-employment. Coupled with a fall in unemployment, this appears to point towards constraints in the overall supply of labour rather than a decline in demand. There is a strong possibility that the continued expansion of the labour market has hit its ceiling. In response, employers would be wise to invest more in their existing workforce, especially in light of recent declines in the number of apprenticeships. Despite the drop in employment, the number of unfilled positions in the UK has hit a record high. There were 798,000 job vacancies in the September-to-November quarter, which is the most since comparable records began in 2001, as this chart shows: So why are firms struggling to fill these vacancies? Dr John Philpott, Director of The Jobs Economist, says the supply of skilled labour is tailing off. The rapid growth in labour supply of recent years has seemingly gone into the reverse. The main reasons for this are a sudden surge in student numbers and a fall in the number of citizens of the central and eastern European countries (the A8) that joined the EU in 2004. In principle, this drop in available labour should be good news for unemployed jobseekers. The steady unemployment rate may therefore indicate a lack of employability on the part of the remaining pool of unemployed. The CBI, which represents British bosses, confirms that UK companies are still trying to hire staff. Their head of employment, Matthew Percival, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of people in employment has fallen, but the unemployment rate remains low and there are still opportunities for job seekers with vacancies at a record high. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs reports shows that the number of public sector workers rose by 19,000 between June and September, to 5.49 milllion. The ONS says: The largest contributor to these quarterly and annual increases in public sector employment was the National Health Service. But, the number of private sector workers dropped by 75,000 between June and September, to 26.59 million. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze could end early next year, reckons Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: The pay squeeze continues for now, but with wages growing a little more strongly and inflation set to fall back in the new year, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any festive cheer in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 has been a bleak year for living standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real wages have now fallen for the last eight months in a row. And working people will be worse off this Christmas than they were a decade ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boosting pay packets should be a priority for the government - not a side issue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, claims that the UK labour market is still strong - even though real wages are still falling. Hinds says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ending the year on a strong note with figures showing the unemployment rate has fallen every month in 2017, and is now at the lowest it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been in over 40 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment is at a near-record high, and there are over 3 million more people in work now compared to 2010 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the population of Greater Manchester. Universal Credit is helping people get into work quicker, and ensuring they get more money in their pockets for every hour they work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Universal Credit supports both the unemployed and the low paid, as people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to end their benefit claim when they find a job. This is especially important at this time of year, when many people take on temporary seasonal work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Geraint Johnes, Research Director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report is packed with concerns: The latest labour force statistics provide further evidence that the labour market has peaked and is now starting to turn down. Employment fell by some 56000 over the quarter to October. While there was a small increase in the number of full-time employees, there was a large fall (some 65000) in the number of full-time self-employed workers. Unemployment, meanwhile, continued to fall, and now stands at 4.3%. The simultaneous fall in employment and unemployment is possible because there has been a large increase (115000 over the quarter) in the number of economically inactive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have been large falls in employment in the distribution sector (38000) and in information and communication (37000). Meanwhile numbers employed in professional, scientific and technical fields and in administration and support have increased. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The three-month average measure of total weekly pay has increased to 2.5% (from 2.3% at the time of the last release). This is encouraging, but should be viewed alongside two further observations. First, wage growth remains well below the rate of growth of prices, so real wages continue to fall. Secondly, the single-month figure, while less reliable, is more modest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has fallen to 2.3% from 2.8% last time around. So the growth in the three-month measure is largely due to a spike in September that has not fed through into October. Low, and stagnant, wages remain a problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jeremy Cook of foreign exchange firm World First isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report Ed Conway of Sky News fears that the jobs market may be stalling... He also points out that real wages have now been falling since the spring Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group is disappointed that wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising faster, given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is a 42-year low. This is not a great jobs report , despite the fall in unemployment: Worryingly, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits (the claimant count) has risen by 5,900 in November, to 818,000. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures have been revised higher too, to 6,500. British workers are still suffering falling real wages, despite a pick-up in pay in the last quarter. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report shows that pay, including bonuses, rose by 2.5% in the last quarter, up from 2.2% last month. But basic pay (excluding bonuses), only rose by a more modest 2.3% in the August-to-October quarter. With inflation hitting 3% in September and October, and spiking to 3.1% in November, that means people are effectively experiencing a pay cut. Breaking! The number of people in employment across the UK has fallen, for the second month in a row. There were 56,000 fewer people in work in the July-October quarter, compared to the previous three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since May 2015, taking the total number of people in work down to 32.08 million. But the number of people classed as unemployed has also dropped in the last quarter, by 26,000, to 1.43 million. That leaves the unemployment rate at a 42-year low of just 4.3%, the same as last month. Importantly, more people have simply dropped out of the labour force altogether, and are classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomically inactive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Here are the key points from the Office for National Statistics: The UK unemployment rate fell marginally (by 0.1 percentage points) to 4.3% in the three months to October 2017, compared with the previous quarter, to a joint lowest unemployment rate since 1975. The UK employment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 75.1% in the three months to October 2017 compared with the previous quarter. The level of employment fell by 50,000 for men and by 6,000 for women. More to follow! The pound is creeping up this morning, on hopes that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report will show that pay growth (including bonuses) has jumped to 2.5% in the last quarter. Sterling has gained 0.2% against the US dollar to $1.334, and is a little higher against the euro too at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.136. But Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, reckons the pound would suffer if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure are disappointing: Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remains encouraging, sentiment could easily take a hit if wage growth fails to meet market estimations. A situation where pay growth fails to pick up is likely to continue squeezing consumers, especially in view of inflation jumping to its highest level in almost six years at 3.1%. Economist Rupert Seggins has created some useful charts to explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report (which is released in 45 minutes): In the City, shares in Dixons Carphone have jumped by 7.5% in early trading after it reported its best ever Black Friday trading. That makes amends for a 60% tumble in pre-tax profits over the six months to 28 October, when Dixons Carphone suffered from a slowdown in mobile phone sales. CEO Seb James tweets that earnings growth should pick up over the crucial Christmas period: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets is hoping for a cheering unemployment report today: UK Unemployment (9:30am) is expected to drop to a fresh 42-year low of 4.2%, while Average Earnings (incl. bonus) accelerate to a 2017 high of 2.5% (still shy of inflation, which hit a new multi-year high of 3.1% yesterday) and the ex-bonus print holds firm at 2.2%. Here are the City consensus forecasts for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze intensified yesterday, as inflation spiked unexpectedly to a six-year high of 3.1%. Today, we discover if wages are catching up, with the publication of the latest UK labour market report. Economists suspect that higher bonuses may have pushed earnings growth up to 2.5% - slightly closing the gap with inflation. Basic pay is probably still lagging behind, though, at just 2.2% per annum in the last three months. That would leave many workers struggling to keep pace with rising prices. The City will also be looking to see whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created more jobs in the July-October quarter. A month ago, we saw the first drop in employment since the Brexit vote, triggering fears that the labour market is losing momentum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible that the unemployment rate could hit a new four-decade low of just 4.2%. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says traders will focus on the earnings figures. The important element here will be hourly wages, which could give an indication as the extent to which UK household purses are being squeezed. Average hourly wages are expected to be 2.5% in the three months to October, which is a respectable 0.3% increase from the three months to September. This would represent a rare closing in the gap since Brexit, between the cost of living and wage growth. The report is also expected to show resilience in other areas of the labour market, as well such as a further decline in the rate of unemployment. Yet while the UK jobs market may put on another showing of strength, the pound could struggle to react positively for the same Brexit jitter reasons that weighed on the pound following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report. In the City, technology retail group Dixons Carphone and holiday group TUI are reporting results. After European traders have headed home, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve will (probably) raise US interest rates. It will also be Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final press conference as Fed chair, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to reappoint her. Royal Bank of Canada expect little excitement though: Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference should prove to be a non-event given her recent testimony in Congress and that she will soon be stepping down once Powell is confirmed. The bigger question therefore is whether the Fed will significantly alter its economic and rates projections. Our US colleagues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view is that they would prefer to wait until March to make significant upgrades when they are likely to be in a better position to model the impact of the looming tax plan.

                "bodyText":"Poundland faces potential difficulties with suppliers after an insurance company reduced its cover on credit for those selling goods to the cut price chain.

The two Chicago-based exchanges created competing bitcoin futures contracts as prices flew higher and professional investors sought exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange.</p> <p>Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME.</p> <p>Investors will closely watch how CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most-liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities.

They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to actually buy and sell digital currencies, let alone mine them by cracking complicated maths problems. <br></p> <p>Instead, they just take a position and profit, or lose money, when the contract expires, based on CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of bitcoin prices across several exchanges.</p> <p><strong>Secondly</strong>, it allows people to bet against bitcoin. Until now, there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really been any way of wagering that digital currencies are overpriced. Derivatives contracts allow a trader to bet that bitcoin will be worth less than the current price in, say, mid-January (or whenever a particular futures contract expires).</p> <p>That should mean that digital currencies find their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 value, stripping out some of the recent volatility.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the theory, anyway. </p> <p>It may not go as smoothy in practice, as <strong>Lee Wild of interactive investor</strong> explains<strong>:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Introducing futures contracts in the US was meant to give short-sellers access to the market and improve liquidity, but availability is still fairly restricted. The introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the weekend may help, but it will take time.</p> <p>Until it becomes easier to sell short, buying dries up, or there are tech issues or a major hack, bitcoin will keep passing milestones with alarming regularity.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Bitcoin has made a subdued debut onto the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest futures exchange, as a series of politicians and officials voiced concerns about the digital currency. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) became the second exchange to offer bitcoin derivatives trading last night. And right now, bitcoin futures contracts which settle in 2018 have all fallen below their opening value. The January 2018 contract, which initially spiked over $20,000, has now dropped back to $18,920 - having been originally priced at $19,500. Contracts that mature in February, March and June are all in the red (although they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve received little attention compared to the January option). Futures contracts allow traders to bet against an asset, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves could suggest that bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning rally is running out of steam. But, less than 1,000 contracts have been traded today (each one is worth 5 bitcoins). The spot price of bitcoin has also dipped, currently down 1.6% at $18,640 - having hit a new alltime high near $20,000 last night. CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch of bitcoin futures was accompanied by a series of warnings. For example: Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker said bitcoin was dangerous, and investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame regulators if they lost their money. A senior Singaporean regulator said bitcoin had no intrinsic value France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister is pushing for the G20 to debate bitcoin regulation UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairmen, Axel Weber, said regulators should take a closer look at digital currencies Analysts at ING also put the boot into bitcoin, saying it would eventually become just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcniche product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 again. ING cited bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility, scalability issues, and the shadow of regulation among several reasons why it would not replace traditional cash. So those buyers who are hoping to sell their bitcoins at an even higher price in the future may be disappointed, they say: We are enthusiastic about blockchain technology, and the current attention for Bitcoin could boost blockchain and digital currencies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 development. But as we have argued above, we doubt whether Bitcoin itself has what it takes to become a serious mainstream payment systems contender. Instead, we think it is more likely for Bitcoin to return to its roots as a niche payment system. A niche asset adopted worldwide could still have a substantial user base and hence value. It is therefore impossible to say whether the current Bitcoin market price is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a niche asset. Then again, we join the crowd of analysts observing typical bubble characteristics: the idea of an asset that is new, revolutionary, almost magic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hard to understand, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invest anyway because it will become huge. This idea is a form of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this time it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd-thinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes we know about all those previous bubbles that popped, but Bitcoin is really, really different.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are not so sure. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the kerfuffle over Ikea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax affairs: European stock markets have closed at their highest level in almost six weeks, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. The German Dax led the charge, gaining 1.6%, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC and the Italian FTSE MIB both gaining 1.33%. The UK lagged behind, with the FTSE 100 finishing 46 points higher at 7,537, up 0.6%. The Footsie was held back by the pound, which has gained almost a cent today to $1.34 (which is bad for exporters). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the City is anticipating a final deal on US tax cuts soon. Risk on sentiment is driving trading, as investor optimism over the US tax bill being passed sooner rather than later is lifting stocks. The 2 wavering Senators, which could have thrown the vote in the Senate slim majority are now back on side and the markets are cheering. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for G20 leaders to debate bitcoin regulation may win the support of Germany. Bloomberg reports: In Berlin, a Finance Ministry spokesman said it was watching \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bitcoin and other cryptocurrency developments closely,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial supervisor Bafin has already warned of the risks of cryptocurrencies for consumers. In Greece leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has urged banks to do more to clamp down on big time debtors, citing the banking system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record stock of non-performing loans. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a no-holds barred speech Tsipras told leading bankers today that the time had come to crack down on big-time debtors and strategic defaulters as part of efforts to restore liquidity to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash-strapped economy. Those who had allowed bad debt to bust businesses, but done well themselves, had to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chased,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told bank representatives assembled at his office, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Liquidity needs to be restored to the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We need a responsible and effective way to deal with the problem of non-performing loans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By failing to effectively deal with NPLs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of which Greece has the highest amount in the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and provide funding for others, he said, banks were failing to properly support young Greeks in fulfilling their dreams. Describing the role of banks as crucial, the leftist leader also called for the creation of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153observatory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that could advise the government on what banks could offer. With less than a year before the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third international bailout officially expires \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ending, it is hoped, an era of international supervision \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the government is keen to improve daily life. On Friday the International Monetary Fund also cited bad debt as a major obstacle for Cypriot banks despite the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive economic recovery after its own crisis in 2013. NPLs in Cypriot banks amount to 46% of loans -- after Greece the highest amount in the EU. Maybe some of these bubble warnings are getting through to investors. The bitcoin futures price is now moving south, as more traders take a position via CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new derivatives platform. Almost 840 contracts for the January 2018 bitcoin contract have now been traded - with the price now falling to $19,010 [reminder, each contract is for five bitcoins]. Over in New York, the US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 138 points, or 0.5%, to 24,790 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also up, while rallying tech stocks have sent the Nasdaq higher too. Investors are excited by the possibility that the US Congress might reach a final agreement on tax reforms. Those reforms have been heavily criticised by some experts, who fear it will drive up the US deficit and hand the richest Americans a tax cut. So why is Wall Street celebrating? Because the bill will slash corporation tax, delivering a massive windfall to large corporations. Analysts at FxPro say: With the bill reducing corporation tax from 35% to 21%, there will be a windfall to US companies. With the possibility of share buy-backs and/or higher dividends by US Corporations, this will, in turn, increase the pace of interest rate hikes and see a stronger US dollar as a result. But.... foreign exchange expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale points out that bond traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the tax reforms: The US Tax Bill will probably be voted on, pass and will turn up on the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk this week . A significant boost to the economy? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh yes, it is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cries President Trump, who calls it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone of the great Christmas gifts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the middle class. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh no, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd answers the bond market, as 10yr Notes meander along at 2.37% this morning, and TIPS remain mid-range. The bond market fell for the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy promises this time last year and is resolutely unimpressed this time round. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBah, Humbug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sums it up (at the risk of mixing panto-metaphors). Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker has now issued a stern warning to speculators to avoid bitcoin. Lars Rohde, governor of the National Bank of Denmark, told local broadcaster DR that bitcoin was a dangerous bubble, comparing it to the tulip bulb mania of the 17th Century. Rohde declared that putting money into bitcoin was basically gambling, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to stay away [from bitcoin]. It is dangerous. Rohde also warned that people buying bitcoin shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame regulators if they suffer losses when the market crashes. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not a regulated market. It is not the responsibility of the authorities. It is the responsibility of the individual.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So far so smooth for bitcoin today..... Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk the scrum of present-hunters in the shops this lunchtime. Instead, pit your wits against our Christmas quiz.... Breaking away from Bitcoin.... and the European Union has launched an investigation into whether Ikea is unfairly dodging tax. The EU has opened an in-depth investigation into the Swedish furniture giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax deals in the Netherlands, and whether it used a Dutch subsidiary to slash its tax bill. EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trust commissioner Margrethe Vestager is concerned that Ikea may have had an unfair advantage over rivals, by using various subsidiaries to reduce its tax burden. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Member states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The inquiry focuses on two tax rulings in the Netherlands. One allowed Inter Ikea, its Dutch branch, to pay a large licence fee to a Luxembourg-based division which paid less tax. A second ruling involved a loan arrangement between Inter Ikea and a unit in Liechtenstein, which also moved shifted taxable revenue to a low tax jurisdiction. Most of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous tax inquiries have focused on US companies, as Apple and Amazon. This one is closer to home, points out Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit. We should note that CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new bitcoin futures contracts actually covers five units of the digital currency. So the 681 contracts traded so far today have a notional value of 3,405 bitcoins -- or around $65m. Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog has joined the chorus of concerns over cryptocurrencies. Sopnendu Mohanty, the top fintech official at Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary authority (MAS), has warned that people who have invested in bitcoin will come a cropper when they try to withdraw their funds. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has the story: Bitcoin has no fundamental value and is likely to end in tears once speculators discover how hard it can be to extricate their cash, Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog has warned. Sopnendu Mohanty, Fintech chief for Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary authority (MAS), said there was a crucial difference between Bitcoin and rival crypto-currency Ethereum, but it is far from clear whether either improves day-to-day transactions or has much potential as a tool for central banking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bitcoin has no natural intrinsic value. Can you buy a house with it? Can you use it for daily interactions? It may be valued at $18,000 right now but what I want to know is how you convert it into fiat currency and realize that value. The risk comes at the moment of conversion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Daily Telegraph.... More here: Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fintech chief warns on Bitcoin delusion The bitcoin futures price is also rallying. The January contract has now jumped back to $19,645, over the opening price of $19,500, and ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But the trading volume is still quite modest, with exactly 666 contracts so far on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new offering. Other longer-dated bitcoin futures contracts are also available, but are being ignored - just seven have been traded so far. I guess that betting where bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price in June 2018 is too risky even for seasoned traders... Bitcoin is creeping higher again, as early bird traders head to their desks in America. The spot price has jumped back over $19,000, erasing this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small dip as CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures trading got under way. Swissquote Bank, an online bank based in Switzerland, has a more positive view of bitcoin than UBS. It has been letting customers buy bitcoin since July, and today it added four other digital currencies - Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin and Ripple Analyst Yann Quelenn argues that bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scarcity (there can only ever be 21 million coins, with 16m discovered so far) will help push its price higher. Quelenn says: Who would have thought at the start of 2017 that Bitcoin would increase 20-fold? That was simply unpredictable. The introduction of futures trading has driven up prices. Nonetheless, it is also artificially increasing supply and weighing on prices. In the short-run, Bitcoin is likely to reach US$ 25,000. A correction is due at some point, but within the next few years it should easily reach US$ 100,000. By the way: Bitcoin is far from perfect, with high transaction fees and low scalability. And it is expensive, but it is even more scarce. Newsflash: British manufacturers are ending 2017 on a high, with the strongest order books in 30 years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on UK factories, which found that exports and total output are both strong. The survey found that: 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +17% (joint highest with last month and August 1988) 28% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 12% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +16% well above the long-run average of -18% 42% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 11% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +30% above the long-run average of +4% The slump in the pound after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote should have made UK exports more competitive. But...it also means that imported raw materials are more expensive. That is likely to translate into higher prices in the shops in the months ahead. Correction corner: I daftly called UBS a German bank earlier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Swiss, of course (the name dates back to Union Bank of Switzerland) Thanks to the readers who kindly flagged it up. Update: Bitcoin is still hovering around the $18,800 mark, having dropped back from nearly $20,000 overnight. The future price of Bitcoin is also quite stable on CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platform. Just over 650 contracts for bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in January 2018 have now been traded since last night. Right now, that contract is priced at $19,330, down from the opening price of $19,500. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the introduction of futures contracts is having a slight negative impact on the bitcoin price. This negative impact from CME futures on Bitcoin is likely temporary, just like it was with the launch of CBOE futures last week. Until the bulk of the volume of trading is done through futures, spot prices should dictate the futures price, not vice versa. Bitcoin is a rubbish investment, literally! An email just popped into my inbox, announcing that you can use digital currencies to pay to have your company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waste and recycling hauled away. York-based BusinessWaste.co.uk will now accept bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum - along with dusty old cash and credit cards. They insist it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a publicity stunt (perish the very thought!), but a natural response to customer demand... Business Waste spokesperson Mark Hall argues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Individuals and companies are trading in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies all over the world. So of course we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to accept it from our customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some Twitter reaction: Dutch Bank ING shares some of Axel Weber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over bitcoin. In a new research note, ING argue that the digital currency will eventually return to being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153niche product for a select group of enthusiasts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, rather than a revolutionary new currency that reshapes the financial system. Why? They argue that there are several impediments build into bitcoin, which will prevent it becoming the peer-to-peer electronic cash system envisioned by creator Satoshi Nakamoto. For example: Regulation: Its decentralised nature makes it difficult to regulate. Governments and regulators may never come to like decentralised financial networks at all. A negative event, such as a price crash followed by public outcry, could trigger a regulatory crackdown. Intermediaries: Working without intermediaries is cherished by a core group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The mass audience however dislikes having no rights, no recourse, no guarantees, no legal coverage, nothing. They just want secure, reliable and hassle-free access to their money, and a help desk to call when they lose their password. Scalability: The Bitcoin network is currently clogged and the current level of transaction fees (average $8 in November) makes it very unattractive for small payments. Volatility: while the value of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd money is managed by the central bank, Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply is fixed and its value depends greatly on demand. This makes it inherently volatile. Energy use: in the case of Bitcoin, the price of taking out intermediaries is very high electricity consumption. Governance: Blockchain is great at rule enforcement, but does not provide at all for rule-setting. This lack of governance makes implementing innovations slow and painful. Moreover, power may get concentrated in the hands of a few (miners, in the case of Bitcoin). The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Brune Le Maire, has also waded into the bitcoin debate. He wants the G20 group of leading advanced economies to debate the whole issue of digital currencies next speing. Speaking on French news channel LCI, Le Maire says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am going to propose to the next G20 president, Argentina, that at the G20 summit in April we have a discussion all together on the question of bitcoin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Le Maire told French news channel LCI. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how (...) with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But..... can the G20 really do much about bitcoin? They can certainly try to clamp down on criminals who use anonymous decentralised currencies to launder money. But beyond that, it gets tricky. Bitcoin isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an official currency, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall under the control of a central bank. So should it be regulated as a security - a financial asset? Possibly. Back in July, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Security and Exchange Commission ruled that Initial Coin Offerings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where a new digital currency is launched and sold to investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meet some of the criteria. That opens up to prospect of ICOs being scrutinised by regulators. But even that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t extend to interfering with day-to-day prices. The FT have published a good take on the battle between the two rival Chicago-based financial exchanges to offer bitcoin derivatives. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The bitcoin futures race began in earnest on Sunday as exchange operator CME Group challenged another Chicago exchange that had launched the first digital-currency futures a week before. In the first three hours of trading, nearly $50m in bitcoin futures changed hands on CME, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exchange operator by market value. Rival Cboe Global Markets had hosted $30m in bitcoin futures trading over the same time. The two Chicago-based exchanges created competing bitcoin futures contracts as prices flew higher and professional investors sought exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange. Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME. Investors will closely watch how CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most-liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities. Futures listings tend to be a winner-takes-all business. More here: Duelling bitcoin futures go head-to-head as CME launches contract The launch of bitcoin futures contracts has two significant implications. Firstly, it makes it easier for institutional investors to take a position in bitcoin. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to actually buy and sell digital currencies, let alone mine them by cracking complicated maths problems. Instead, they just take a position and profit, or lose money, when the contract expires, based on CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of bitcoin prices across several exchanges. Secondly, it allows people to bet against bitcoin. Until now, there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really been any way of wagering that digital currencies are overpriced. Derivatives contracts allow a trader to bet that bitcoin will be worth less than the current price in, say, mid-January (or whenever a particular futures contract expires). That should mean that digital currencies find their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 value, stripping out some of the recent volatility. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the theory, anyway. It may not go as smoothy in practice, as Lee Wild of interactive investor explains: Introducing futures contracts in the US was meant to give short-sellers access to the market and improve liquidity, but availability is still fairly restricted. The introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the weekend may help, but it will take time. Until it becomes easier to sell short, buying dries up, or there are tech issues or a major hack, bitcoin will keep passing milestones with alarming regularity. Right now, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long queue of investors, both amateur and professional, still waiting for a ride. This bubble is not bursting yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CNN Money reckons the bitcoin bandwagon \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just keeps rolling on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the launch of futures trading on CME. They say: The involvement of top financial institutions in the bitcoin market underscores its growing mainstream acceptance even as government officials, business leaders and economists continue to warn people against investing in it. The CME launch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adds considerable legitimacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to bitcoin trading, said Shane Chanel, an adviser at Australian investment services firm ASR Wealth Advisers. Swiss bank UBS has warned anyone keen to invest in bitcoin that they risk losing their money. UBS chairman Axel Weber fears that the digital currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent gains are unsustainable, and says investors and speculators should keep away. Speaking to Swiss newspaper NZZ, he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We as a bank have consciously warned against this product because we do not assess it to be valuable or sustainable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weber argues that financial regulators should now step in, given the surge of interest in bitcoin recently. Otherwise, he fears smaller investors could be wiped out by bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility. As Weber puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As soon as small investors invest, the regulators are required.... I would welcome an discussion with regulators about cryptocurrencies. There are already signs that governments are taking more interest in bitcoin, with European officials concerned that it is being used for moneylaundering. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of finance, or an unsustainable speculative bubble that will cost investors their shirts? The jury is still out on Bitcoin. What we do know, though, is that the cryptocurrency has crossed another barrier -- the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exchange is now offering bitcoin futures. From today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is allowing investors to wager whether they think bitcoin will rise or fall in value in the months ahead (after seeing it surge around 2,000% this year). CME is the second exchange to offer bitcoin futures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rival Cboe stole a march last week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this move shows how digital currencies have pushed their way into the mainstream. The launch has gone fairly smoothly so far. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of bitcoin initially surged to almost $20,000, a new record, before dipping back towards $18,800 by 8am London time. Such volatility shows why sceptics argue that bitcoin is hardly a reliable store of value, mind you. Over on CME, the January 2018 futures price has actually dropped a little in the first few hours of trading. It was priced at $19,500, but is now changing hands at $19,370. That suggests that investors expect bitcoin to broadly hold its value over the next month. Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, told Reuters that many traders are approaching bitcoin cautiously: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We saw a nice open on light volume, but pretty uneventful so far,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a brand-new asset class and I think perhaps a lot of investors want to sit back and see how this plays out before dipping their toes in this market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today... Stock markets are expected to rise, as investors salivate over the prospect of US tax reforms being signed off by Donald Trump by the end of this week. New eurozone inflation figures are due this morning, and likely to show prices rose by just 1.5% in the last 12 months. In the UK, the CBI publishes its latest industrial trends survey, showing how British factories fared last month.

                "bodyText":"It was a busy day for the week before Christmas. The International Monetary Fund welcomed progress on Brexit talks but warned the timeframe is ambitious because of the long list of tasks to address. It cut its forecast for the UK economy from the 1.7% it expected in October to 1.6%, and said it expected the economy to grow by 1.5% in 2018. And managing director Christine Lagarde defended the overly gloomy warnings about the effect of Brexit on the economy which the fund made ahead of the referendum. Meanwhile Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, said that the European commission wants the Brexit transition period to end on 31 December 2020. Still with Brexit, the Bank of England said it planned to spare European banks from costly extra capital requirements after Brexit. But it warned that could change if the current talks are unsuccessful. Bank governor Mark Carney and other officials were up before MPs at the Treasury Select Committee, discussing bank stress tests and, inevitably, Brexit. Carney said the presumption was there would continue to be supervisory co-operation and information sharing with EU authorities after Brexit. He said the UK financial system was effectively the banker for Europe, and there were economies of scale that benefited both sides. Carney also talked about Bitcoin, and said he did not expect regulation of the crypto-currency to come under the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It is a cliche, but buy on the rumour and sell on the fact does seem to hold true sometimes for stock markets. So the bumper rises seen ahead of the US tax proposals has fizzled out now the plan is has more or less been passed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 18.87 points or 0.25% to 7525.22 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.11% to 13,069.17 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.56% lower at 5352.77 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.74% to 22,109.65 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.26% lower at 10,207.7 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.73% to 789.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently flat. On ringfencing, Woods says the deadline in January 2019 but he would expect much of it to be done in four to six months. We are in a good place to regulate both ringfenced bank and the rest. And with that the meeting ends. Is there a risk banks could reallocate not from UK to EU but to somewhere else? Sharp says they have big European presences, and London has a tremendous competitive advantage. But there is no doubt that there will be profit opportunities in EU due to growth possibilities there. Question on misconduct? Will it be helped by senior management regime, will we get to a point where midconduct doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t form part of stress tests? Carney says previous misconduct is in the tests, what is not in there is what we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know yet about other possible types of misconduct. It could be they will pay less than the amount provided for in the stress tests. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad commentary that this is systemic, but hope to see it reduce. Question on foreign investment in the UK. Is that because of confidence in UK growth prospects, is it the kindness of strangers and if there is a reversal what are the implications for domestic credit conditions? Some of that reversal is in the stress tests. One of the big elements of flows has been into real estate, especially London. These are signs of confidence. There are lots of reasons to continue to see the flow. But if there was a shrinking, this would be a concern but you would see this in the risk premia. Question: A lot of this comes from China. What if see a sharp adjustment in China? That is again in stress test. This has been a concern for a number of years, the growth of indebtedness in China. China has many strengths, authorities have taken steps and will take more, but we recognise it as a risk. It will have an impact on the UK because we have a very open economy but we have done our best to make sure our system is resilient to that type of risk. Nicky Morgan leaves for a meeting with the prime minister and John Mann takes over, and asks about Bitcoin. Who will regulate it and if no one does will it be a problem? Carney says at present we do not view Bitcoin as a financial stability issue. It is not connected closely to the mainstream financial system. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like an equity type risk. Carney expects international regulators will discuss crypto-currencies and potential future role of central bank digital currencies. He does not expect Bitcoin regulation to come under the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit. He says the core financial system needs currencies that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take days to settle [as Bitcoin does]. Question on the gender pay gap. Carney says they are high relative to other industries. It requires multi pronged approach to change over a period of time. The Women in Finance initiative etc, these will make a difference if they are followed through and focus minds of senior management and their shareholders. Question on cyber developments and whether the bank has sufficient skills. Woods says it is challenging, mainly in operations resilience. Financial system is under attack, the Bank triggered its response systems for sufficiently large cyber attacks six times in last year. But now a significant development, we have brought a specialist GCHQ unit into our response team. On the regulatory systems, Carney says: We been through 10 years of fixing the faults of the financial crisis. With so many new rules in place, there is some duplication, and now the big job is to make adjustments to those rules on an international level. Question: we are seeing some divergence in regulatory framework, eg in the US. Carney says, the changes actual and contemplated in the US are moving it more to how regulations are imposed in UK eg, the way they conduct stress tests, is moving more towards the way the Bank of England conducts them. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say we are seeing in the US an undercutting of UK standards of financial regulation. We had a near death financial situation, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run those risks again. The UK financial standards will continue to be at least as high as now after Brexit. Question on jobs numbers, and comments that to judge by the numbers leaving immediately after Brexit rather than four or five years out would be a mistake. Carney agrees. If in the short term there is an ability to retain interconections, the initial job losses are less. If those are pulled into the continent the job losses are much greater. I would focus more on medium term numbers as being more relevant. There is likely to be a degree of expediency, decisions will have to be made in interests of system. Question about co-operation with EU colleagues: Woods says Brexit is throwing up a point of tension within the EU, which will probably build rather than subside. EU authorities tend to impose regulatory restrictions that the UK applies to retail banking to wholesale banking too. Question about the potential loss to London of clearing business post Brexit? Carney says the raw economics are compelling, so if the euro business were pulled out that is 13% of the overall pool. The loss of benefits would in our judgement cost at least 1 to 3 basis points to EU institutions, and that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound much but 1 basis point equates to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21bn per annum. Question: is there a clear enough understanding of the cost? Exchanges like this help, and it is a cost which would be borne by European pension funds, and industries and ultimately European households. Now questions to Carney about the London Stock Exchange succession planning (to recap Xavier Rolet decided to leave the LSE but an activist shareholder wanted him to stay on.) Carney says they were aware of the issues, had multiple conversations with the board and management, it was clear that the then CEO was not going to continue with his role but they were in a legal position where they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say he would never return even though he had no intention of continuing under any circumstances. It was very Kafka-esq. Carney says consumer credit was a key component of the stress tests. The debt burden is less than it was in the 1990s. But there are without question parts of the working population that are vulnerable, who start from an overextended position. Those issues are important... we look at how we target an intervention to manage the scale of the risk. Mann: are you underplaying the problem of the rise of consumer credit? Woods says the fact it is growing at 10% a year is causing some concern to the committee. The impact is different on different firms. We publish how much we think individual banks would lose. John Mann: Is risky consumer credit only a problem at some banks. FPC member Richard Sharp says they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into the micro level. We were concerned at the pace of the growth of consumer credit in the economy. We formed a consensus and we acted. Is there enough being done to prevent banking misconduct? Carney says, there is a lot being done to reduce banking misconduct. One of the things that is recognised is that fines alone of institutions well after the fact that affect current shareholders and not the individuals who perpetrated the act are a fairly ineffective way, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the tool to be the deterrent. There has been a dramatic change in the UK so senior managers are responsible for the actions, and if there is a pattern of misconduct, then it is not just those individuals [who commit misconduct] who are held accountable but senior managers. One of consequences is ability to claw back bonuses. Barclays and RBS failed 2017 test on the basis of the cut-off date for their capital reserves, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve since built that up. Are you comfortable with that margin of error? Woods says this is the first year we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t required any of the banks to do anything on the back of stress tests. On those two, if we ran the tests today they would both pass. Quite a significant moment. Question on the 2017 stress tests, saying it was not designed to deal with a disorderly Brexit. How does the test scenario differ from a disorderly scenario. Are you confident all scenarios have been adequately tested. Carney says the tests have a severe macroeconomic scenario, pound down by a quarter, house prices down by a third etc. On top there is a stressed hit for misconduct costs for the banks of \u00c2\u00a340bn. We have \u00c2\u00a350bn of losses in the first two years, worse than financial crisis. Then looked at things that could go wrong in disorderly Brexit, derivatives, loss of trade, loss of confidence in UK assets etc. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve looked at combination of all those, and the scale of losses would be significant but would be encompassed by stress test. The banking system is adequately capitalised to take that hit. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. If had disorderly Brexit and recession and misconduct at same time, likely system would need more capital. But we now have a banking system with 16% Tier 1 capital, and we have done it because there are these possibilities. Lights out: Nicky Morgan turns to the Budget, and the forecasts from the OBR, which she says are predicated on smooth and orderly Brexit. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said financial services not being part of a free trade agreement, so do you have a comment on the OBR forecasts and Brexit affecting economy. Carney says the OBR reduced its productivity forecast, we had reduced, they are now below ours. [As for] the smooth and orderly aspect, at the MPC we have a similar assumption. At FPC we look at risk so we look at a disorderly scenario - one of tests for stress tests is are they tough enough. On Barnier, Carney says the European council sets negotiating mandate not European Commission...The UK financial system, like it or not, is effectively the banker for Europe, in the most complicated bits of finance, the wholesale market, the equity underwriting, the derivatives, the fx trading. There are economies of scale that benefit both sides. We have improved regulations so we can operate the system reliably (lights dim in the room to laughter) and we have a commitment to openess in the system. From a trade perspective...you can have free trade in financial services..as you have common, high standards. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the argument that because it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been done in the past it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done in the future. Question: of the four that are systemic, how much capital would they need to commit to UK? Carney says its relatively modest, bigger capital requirment would be because of the wholesale bank footprint. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around \u00c2\u00a310s of billions. It would be material for some institutions and for the system. Carney is asked if there is enough time if changes need to be made. He says, we know these firms now, we know the risk so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a pretty good position to have a limited amount of time to adjust their business model. Deputy governor Sam Woods adds we would have needed a good reason to depart from established way of doing this. We will keep position under review as negotiations progress. Nicky Morgan says this seems like a plan for the status quo. Alternative would have been for [EU banks] to create subsidiaries. Carney says if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have co-operation with EU, we will tell banks to create subsidiaries. Should we say you subsidiarise now and then un-subsidiarise in the future if there is an agreement, that would cause a tremendous amount of disruption. We can at the moment manage the risk. Now is not the time to say, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re never going to get a deal. But it at the select committee in a year from now - which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m already looking forward to - where it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have {an agreement] then those directions to susidiarise would be there. It is clearer now which firms might have to subsidiarise which businesses. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this is a good outcome for system, for Uk, for EU. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had discussions with all major EU counterparts and ECB to let them know this is our approach. Carney says this is a proposal and is out for consultation. The Treasury Select committee is beginning, chaired by Nicky Morgan. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is going through the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier announcement. He says, foreign banks have \u00c2\u00a34tn of goods and assets, worth two times UK GDP. We have to authorise those banks, and we have announced an update on that. We will need to authorise those banks that currently use the passporting. We look at two things. What does bank do and where is it from? The question is how systemic are they. Do they deal with households and small businesses, do they have retail. They will be systemic, and it will have consequences. Four out of the 77 from Europe fall into this category. The other aspect is in wholesale activity, question is how big is balance sheet, how interconnected is institution to UK financial system. If they are systemic, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our relationship with home supervisor. At present we have strong arrangements, but in Europe those will change. We have to take a decision. Our presumption will be we will continue to have a form of supervisory co-operation and information sharing with EU authorities after Brexit. But we retain all our options, and if that is not forthcoming there will be consequences for those institutions. Our responsibilty is to protect system and UK citizens. Could be creating subsidiaries, restrictions on business, ask for further capital requirements. Just ahead of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance before the Treasury Select Committee, the Bank said it planned to spare European banks from costly extra capital requirements after Brexit. But it warned that could change if the current talks are unsuccessful. Reuters reports: Setting out its position for a possible tussle with Brussels over London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a top global financial hub, the BoE said it wanted to ensure it could effectively oversee foreign banks and financial services firms after Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The foundation of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach is the presumption that there will continue to be a high degree of supervisory cooperation between the UK and the EU,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the BoE said in a statement. That assumption might be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revisited as Brexit negotiations proceed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods said in a letter to the bosses of banks and insurers... The BoE said the bigger and more complex the branches of European banks in the UK, the more supervisory cooperation there would have to be to avoid them being classed as subsidiaries, requiring them to park costly extra capital in Britain. There 77 branches of banks from the European Economic Area, in Britain. There are also 80 branches of insurers from the EEA. The BoE plans to start the process of reauthorising the branches of up to 200 EEA financial firms in Britain in early 2018. It hopes Britain will secure a Brexit transition deal to start after Brexit in March 2019 to give regulators more time. Back with Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, saying the European commission wants the transition period to end on 31 December 2020, and Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, does not appear entirely happy: Businesses will welcome the fact that the European Commission has now joined the UK government in backing a single adjustment for business, at the end of an agreed transition period. However, the end date proposed by the Commission seems better-suited to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bureaucratic framework than to real-world business conditions. The two sides\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 main criterion should be to set a timeframe that allows businesses on both sides of the English Channel to adequately prepare for a new trading relationship between both parties. Over in Athens, parliament has ratified the 2018 budget. It is the last one before debt-burdened Greece exits international supervision under its latest bailout programme. Helena Smith reports: Passage of the budget marks the beginning of the end of a new era, according to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftist-led government. Addressing MPs last night, prime minister Alexis Tsipras described the budget - which includes almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn in new austerity measures - as the last one that would have to be applied under an economic adjustment programme. Already, Greece was on the road to economic recovery, he said, with the country heading towards a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean exit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when its third rescue programme officially expires next August. He told parliament: This year is the first with real growth after many years of recession. We took over a country with empty coffers, with unemployment close to 27%, with zero trust among its partners and international markets, and with the 10-year bond yield at almost 8%. The claims were quickly debunked in an often rambunctious debate with the centre-right. The main opposition leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, described the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean exit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new big lie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Instead of spurring growth, the new fiscal measures would dampen it, he said, insisting that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to achieve high and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exhausting surpluses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the years to come would mean yet more international supervision. The debate comes against a backdrop of disquiet among lenders over welfare handouts pledged by Tsipras, including a one-off \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 payment to the unemployed, announced in recent days. The International Monetary Fund says its gloomy forecasts in the runup to the referendum are now playing out in the numbers. Even so, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for UK growth for this year and next compare favourably with those from both the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent forecaster. IMF 2017: 1.6% 2018: 1.5% OECD 2017: 1.5% 2018: 1.2% OBR 2017: 1.5% 2018: 1.4% Here is our full story on the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual health check of the UK economy. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, gave a strong defence of the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecasts for the UK after Brexit, saying pre-referendum warnings of slower growth were coming true. Retail sales rose in the runup to Christmas according to the latest survey from the CBI, but at a slower pace than retailers had expected. Supermarkets were the main driver of growth in the year to December. The business lobby group said evidence from the 109 firms surveyed suggested that online sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday - considered two of the busiest shopping days of the year - were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unspectacular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Alpesh Paleja, principal economist at the CBI: Retailers have seen decent growth heading into the vital Christmas trading period, although it was weaker than expected. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that people are stocking up on food for their Christmas lunch, with grocers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sales driving most of the sales growth seen in December. Notwithstanding the sales growth seen in the last couple of months, underlying trading conditions are tough for retailers. We expect the squeeze on real pay for households to last a while longer, so retailers will still face challenging conditions ahead. Of those surveyed, 37% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in the year to December, while 17% said they were down. The resulting balance of +20% was slower than the +30% predicted by retailers, and weaker than November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +26%. Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, has given a news conference, announcing that the European commission wants the transition period to end on 31 December 2020. For all the details, follow our politics live blog here: Christine Lagarde has insisted she and the IMF were right to be gloomy about the implications of a leave vote in the runup to the EU referendum in June 2016. She said the numbers on the UK economy today were proving the point, adding UK growth is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit of a disappointment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd compared with other countries. Here is a reminder of Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predictions before the vote: The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The UK chancellor Philip Hammond says he agrees with the IMF on the urgent need for a Brexit transition deal. One of biggest boosts we can provide to our economy is making early progress on delivering certainty and clarity about our future relationship. The IMF is clear that the Brexit vote is already weighing on the UK economy. Growth in the first three quarters of 2017 was slower than a year ago. Despite a strong recovery in global growth and supportive macroeconomic policies, the impact of the decision to exit the European Union has weighed on private domestic demand. The employment rate has remained around record highs, but the sharp depreciation of sterling following the referendum pushed up consumer price inflation, squeezing household real income and consumption. Business investment growth has been lower than would be expected in the context of strong global growth and high levels of capacity utilisation, owing to heightened uncertainty about economic prospects. The Washington-based fund is predicting UK growth slowed in 2017 to 1.6% in 2017, from 1.8% in 2016. It is expected to slow further in 2018 to 1.5%. Here is what the IMF had to say about the ambitious nature of the timeframe for Brexit talks. Recent progress in negotiations between the UK and EU is welcome. Both parties have reached agreement in principle on citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights, on Northern Ireland, and on the financial settlement. While the ultimate outcome of the next phase of discussions is for the UK and EU to determine, an agreement that minimizes tariff and non-tariff barriers and ensures that firms have access to the labor they need would best support growth. The list of tasks that remains to be accomplished is very long, and the timeframe to do so is ambitious. They include agreeing on a trade deal with the EU, negotiating new arrangements with around 60 countries to replace those to which the UK is currently party via its membership in the EU, bolstering human and IT resources in customs and other services, and translating many thousands of pages of EU law into UK domestic statute. The government has set aside a budgetary allocation to support Brexit preparations. Early agreement on a transition period would avoid a cliff edge exit in March 2019 and reduce the uncertainty facing firms and households. The International Monetary Fund has welcomed progress on Brexit talks but warned the timeframe is ambitious because of the long list of tasks to address. The fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 1.5% in 2018. Christine Lagarde is in London to present the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual review of the UK economy at the Treasury. As tradition dictates, Lagarde will be introduced by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, when the press conference kicks off shortly. In the run-up to the referendum, Lagarde predicted a leave vote would result in a stock market and house price crash. A setback for Uber this morning after the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled it is a transport services company, subject to the same rules as other cab firms. Uber had argued that it is a computer services business, after a challenge brought by taxi drivers in Barcelona. The decision in Luxembourg will apply across the whole of the EU, including the UK. Here is our full story on the ruling: Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary, the outspoken and often controversial boss of Ryanair, has been asked by MPs to answer allegations by workers that the airline sometimes pays less than the minimum wage. The work and pensions committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy committee (BEIS), have written to O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary following allegations by crew, published in the Daily Mail, that bosses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t treat us like humans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said Ryanair workers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can rest assured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that MPs would be investigating further. He added: Sadly, it will not surprise me if the sorry picture painted here is true: a company that turned in \u00c2\u00a31.15bn profit last year squeezing its workers. People who work long, hard hours and have an important role in passenger safety, and yet apparently cannot count on receiving the National Minimum Wage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even close to it. Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee: These allegations of hours of unpaid work, of charges for uniforms, of fees being incurred to leave, suggest a company falling well short of its duty to the staff who help their planes get off the ground and who spend the flight attending to and serving its paying customers. This appears to be evidence of a company trying to wiggle out of its basic responsibility to pay its workers the National Minimum Wage. Field and Reeves have asked O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary to answer a series of questions by Monday 8 January. Investors across Europe are in a subdued mood this morning, with all the major indices following Wall Street lower. Here are the scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,537 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% at 13,231 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,375 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 22,191 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,224 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 391 President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-trailed tax reform bill cleared a major hurdle last night and this morning, making it through Congress and then the Senate. A procedural issue means the bill will have to go back to a revote in Congress, but this appears to be a technicality and is not expected to derail the bill. The progress failed to lift Wall Street on Tuesday however, in what CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson describes as a classic case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy the rumour, sell the news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Having teased, tantalised and promised the markets for most of this year that we would see some significant measures to reform the tax code it seems that US President is on the cusp of delivering some measures that, depending on who you listen to, are either transformative or unfair. Having seen the bill pass through Congress fairly easily last night, and pass through the Senate this morning it seems increasingly likely that the bill will be signed into law by President Trump in the coming days, though it will need to go back to a revote in Congress after a procedural snag made last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote invalid. That obstacle aside it now looks increasingly likely that just over a year since being elected that Trump is likely to have something to show for his first year as President. The big question now is whether having seen stocks rise in anticipation of legislation being passed, that the current momentum is maintained or we see a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy the rumour, sell the news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as we head towards the Christmas break. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says the Tesco/Booker deal could open the door to other deals. Given how easily this deal was approved, it leaves the door open for further significant consolidation in the sector and the potential for a major change in the UK retail space over the coming years. The case for consolidation is strong given the intense competition, heightened margin pressure and the emergence of new threats online. Retailers should be looking to strike now to secure their economies of scale. For Tesco/Booker it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a win on several levels. Cost synergies of around \u00c2\u00a3200m a year, mainly from buying and distribution, are expected, although this could a lot more and may exceed \u00c2\u00a3300m. But as previously noted the 24% premium that Tesco paid for Booker takes some of the shine off the deal. And the big risk is that Tesco takes its eyes off the turnaround strategy. We note that big Tesco shareholders Schroders and Artisan Partners said it was too expensive and too risky. But on the whole the benefits from synergies should more than compensate for any risks to the turnaround. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition watchdog has given the go-ahead this morning to Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the cash-and-carry group that also owns brands including Londis and Budgens. The Competition and Markets Authority had already given the provisional green light in November, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is a confirmation of that. The CMA concludes that the deal is not bad news for customers. Simon Polito, chair of the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiry into the deal, says in a statement today: We have carefully listened to feedback from retailers and wholesalers who operate in what are highly competitive UK retail and wholesale sectors. Retailers have told us that they shop around for the best prices and service from their wholesaler, and we are confident that this will continue after Tesco buys Booker. This has been an important investigation for us. Millions of people use their local supermarket or convenience store to buy their groceries or essentials, so it is vital that they have enough choice to secure the best deal for them. Having examined the evidence in depth, we are satisfied this will remain the case following the merger. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in London this morning to present the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual health check of the UK economy. She will give the presentation at the Treasury, following an introduction from the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The press conference kicks off at 10am. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review will be closely scrutinised for the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest take on how much of an impact Brexit might have on the UK economy. In the runup to the referendum, Lagarde was an outspoken opponent of Brexit, and warned a vote to leave the EU would result in a stock market and house price crash. How does the IMF now think the UK will fare? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you its assessment as it comes in from. Also coming up: 11am GMT: The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distributive trades survey for December will provide the latest snapshot of how the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector is performing in the runup to Christmas 1.15pm GMT: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England will appear with colleagues at the Treasury Select Committee on the subject of financial stability",

Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot.

                "bodyText":"Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is closing a turbulent year on steadier ground, as households defy the biggest squeeze on disposable income in living memory, a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month shows. In a period in which Theresa May won a deal with Brussels to move the Brexit talks forward to focus on trade, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly tracker found pockets of strength in the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even as businesses express increasing concerns over the size of the challenge to come. There were some concerning developments. The cost of living squeeze intensified and there were signs that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs boom of recent years has come to an end. The International Monetary Fund used its annual health check of the UK to say that the Brexit vote in June 2016 was responsible for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slower growth and stress that the government needed a deal with the EU that kept trade as free as possible. Businesses are also continuing to press the government to make further progress in talks with the EU, despite this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakthrough, warning they will keep hiring and investment plans on ice without greater clarity. Firms want to see a transitional deal to smooth the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU as early as possible. However, there may be a long wait amid political tensions within the government. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows how sterling staged a recovery against the dollar before the government struck a deal with the EU27 to progress talks to focus on trade, while the FTSE has benefited from a global boom in share values as investors anticipate greater corporate profits owing to a package of tax cuts put forward by tDonald Trump. Among the strongest indicators of short-term economic strength for the UK was an unexpected increase in high street sales. Economists had thought rising inflation and sluggish wage growth would lead to a drop in spending, which has been one of the big reasons for a slowdown for the UK economy this year. But Black Friday promotions gave Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers a much-needed fillip, as sales figures for November show the US-inspired period of discounts led to a 1.1% increase in the total value of goods sold last month compared against October. City economists had expected a rise of 0.4%. There were warnings that consumers may have simply brought forward their Christmas shopping to exploit the steep discounts on electrical goods and other items, which may lead to weaker sales in the traditional boom month of December. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said it was positive to see strong consumer spending figures, because weaker retail sales had been one of the key issues driving the slowdown of the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key issue for retailers will be whether we see this type of growth rate sustained into the crucial Christmas and New Year sales period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest economic data has been mixed, but there have been some positive news on consumer spending and on the global economy to offset continued evidence of a jobs slowdown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs-creation machine of recent years showed signs of chugging into reverse over the past month, as the latest official figures showed the number of people in work fell by 56,000 in the three months ending in October.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thank you for following the blog and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow morning. AM Before closing up for the day, some good news from Toys R Us where about 2,000 jobs are expected to be saved. The news follows an eleventh hour solution after the ailing retailer agreed to pump more than \u00c2\u00a39m into its pension plan over the next two years in a last-minute deal with the state-backed pensions lifeboat. Without the deal, the retailer would probably have gone into administration. The Pension Protection Fund joined landlords and other creditors in backing Toys R Us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voluntary insolvency (CVA) plan, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores from next spring as well as reducing the size of others. Consultations with affected employees will commence in the new year. While up to 800 people could still lose their job as a result of the restructure, more than 2,000 jobs will be saved as Toys R Us tries to turn its remaining UK business around. Read the full story here: Balraj Sroya, trader at Foenix Partners, gives his take on US GDP for the third quarter, which was revised down to an annual rate of 3.2%. US GDP is still on track for Trump to keep to his campaign promise of 3% GDP for 2017 even as Q3 missed forecast projections. The GDP print came out lower than consensus at 3.2%, with the blame placed on weaker consumer spending. With the GOP tax bill being passed earlier in the week, Republicans are expecting the changes in tax code will see wages increasing and the average consumer having more disposable income. Once the fourth quarter growth figure is released, investors will be keen to see if Trump actually delivered on his pledge and whether the effects of the biggest tax reform in 30 years is beneficial for growth. There were 245,000 new US jobless claims in the latest week, more than the previous week and more than the 231,000 predicted by economists. The US economy grew by an annual rate of 3.2% in the third quarter, slightly slower than the 3.3% estimated previously. Despite the downgrade, it was the quickest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2015 and an improvement on the 3.1% growth in the second quarter. The FTSE 100 is up 35 points and outperforming its major European peers this afternoon, as investors remain fairly subdued. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,560 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.1% at 13,057 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: flat at 5,352 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: flat at 22,113 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,197 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 389 Billionaire property developers the Candy brothers have won a bruising high court battle after a judge dismissed all claims brought against them by a former friend for extortion, blackmail, intimidation and breach of the data protection act. Read our full story here: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has given his take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances figures, which showed borrowing fell in November. He says they are another reminder of broken Tory promises: These figures are further bad news just before Christmas following on from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy outlook issued yesterday. They only remind us yet again of the broken Tory promises to eliminate the deficit by 2015. The national debt continues to grow despite the tricks the Chancellor attempted in his Budget last month with Housing Association debt to hide his failure on the economy. This continued failure by the Tory Government over these past seven years is simply unacceptable. These figures today reaffirm why we need an urgent change of course next year, halting the growing emergency in our public services and ending the failed Tory austerity cuts. The next Labour government will set out a serious plan for the public finances with strategic investment underpinned by our fiscal credibility rule, to help build a high-wage, high-skill economy for the many not the few. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC, takes a look at some of the detail in the November public finances data: Public borrowing in November was broadly unchanged from last year, but for the financial year to date the budget deficit is running around \u00c2\u00a33 billion less than in the same period last year. This reflects central government receipts growing at around 4%, while central government spending has only been rising at around 3%. VAT, income tax, national insurance and stamp duty revenues have all been growing at a reasonable rate so far this year. As the OBR has indicated, however, self-assessment receipts in early 2018 may be less strong than in early 2017, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures still leave public borrowing on track to come in at around \u00c2\u00a350 billion in 2017/18 as a whole. Further progress on reducing the budget deficit may be slow over the next couple of years as Brexit-related uncertainty drags on UK growth, which we expect to lag some way behind both the US and the Eurozone in 2018 and 2019. However, the deficit is no longer at the dangerous levels reached immediately after the financial crisis, so the Chancellor can afford to take his time in making further progress towards his long-term objective of budget balance. For the moment, the greater priority is to provide short term support to the economy during the Brexit process and to fund much needed investment in housing, transport infrastructure and the NHS. The Treasury has responded to the latest public finances figures, seizing on the fact that borrowing in the fiscal year so far is the lowest since 2007. A spokesperson said: This is the best year-to-date borrowing in a decade, but there is still further to go to repair the public finances. We continue to build an economy fit for the future by taking a balanced approach, getting debt falling while investing in our vital public services and keeping taxes low. The jewel in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing crown is at risk because of Brexit uncertainty and falling wages according to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest union, Unite. The latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the number of cars made in British factories destined for the UK market plunged 28% in November to 24,276. It was the fourth month in a row that cars built for the home market fell. Tony Burke, Unite assistant general secretary, said it was terrible news for Britain: This is awful news in the run-up to Christmas for the British car industry and the UK economy. The continued falling demand in the UK market because of Brexit uncertainty and falling wages is yet more evidence of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic incompetence. When other economies around the world are motoring ahead, the UK is stuck in the slow lane hobbled by the biggest squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic era. Meanwhile uncertainty around Brexit is leaving motor manufacturers stalling on the investment needed to maintain Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world leading status in car making. The motor industry is the jewel in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing crown, sustaining communities with decent well paid jobs. Government ministers need to rid themselves of their economic complacency and tackle falling incomes which are putting people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wallets and the UK economy into reverse. The UK government borrowed \u00c2\u00a38.7bn last month, which was \u00c2\u00a3200m less than the same month last year and the lowest November net borrowing since 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis. It was lower than the \u00c2\u00a38.9bn predicted by economists. The figure for October was also revised down, to \u00c2\u00a37.8bn from \u00c2\u00a38bn, topping off some decent news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Borrowing in the fiscal year so far (April to November) was \u00c2\u00a348.1bn, down \u00c2\u00a33.1bn on the same period last year, and also the lowest since 2007. It puts the chancellor on course to meet the Office for Budget Responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation that full-year borrowing to the end of March 2018 will be \u00c2\u00a349.9bn. January usually brings a big surplus when annual income tax bills are due. The figures were boosted by the Office for National Statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to reclassify housing associations as private rather than public sector for the first time this month. This is estimated to have pushed down borrowing by about \u00c2\u00a3300m. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too carried away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the figures: While a continuation of the current trend would see borrowing undershoot the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast by \u00c2\u00a37bn, some deterioration in the public finances should occur towards the end of the fiscal year. In particular, strong self-assessment tax receipts collected in January and February 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to changes in the dividend tax rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be repeated. As a result, we doubt that borrowing will come in significantly below the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00c2\u00a349.9 forecast for the 2017/18 fiscal year. However, if we are right in thinking that the OBR is too gloomy about the prospects for GDP growth, then borrowing should come down at a faster rate than it expects further ahead. Alex Buttle, director at the car comparison website, motorway.co.uk, is downbeat about prospects for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry: This is a stunning fall in domestic demand and pretty much sums up the last six months for an industry reeling from punitive diesel taxes and crumbling consumer confidence. The fact that manufacturing levels fell just 4.6% last month, when domestic demand dropped off a cliff, shows just how reliant we are on exports. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably more worrying than faltering demand, as right now we have no EU trade agreement and zero clarity over trading agreements with countries outside the EU. The UK car industry is teetering on the edge, and the economic landscape is unlikely to improve in 2018 with Brexit uncertainty ramped up to another level. The number of cars made in UK factories in the first 11 months of the year was 2% lower than over the same period in 2016, at 1.58m vehicles. If the weak trend persists in December, UK car production will have suffered its first annual fall since 2009, when Britain was in the depths of the financial crisis. In that year, production plunged 31% to 999,460 cars. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listed house builders are among the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers this morning: It follows the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go further than expected by forcing developers to ban controversial ground rents for all new apartments and houses. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, also said the government would go ahead with a ban on leaseholds on new-build houses, first announced in July. European investors are in no mood to celebrate this morning, with the major markets following Wall Street lower. It turns out the markets are not as ecstatic about the successful passage of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as the President himself. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: flat at 7,526 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.4% at 13,019 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.5% at 5,324 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 22,050 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% at 10,148 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 387 UK consumer confidence fell again in December according to the latest monthly snapshot from GfK. The index fell by one point to -13, marking almost two years of declining consumer confidence. GfK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Staton said there was nothing to suggest the mood among UK households would pick up any time soon: We need to see several issues move on before the downward trend of the consumer mood changes. We need to have a better sense of how Brexit will pan out, and also of how quickly and how far interest rates will rise. But none of this will be resolved quickly so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every likelihood that 2018 will take us lower. Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, has found something to be cheerful about in the UK car market: UK car manufacturing is on course to fall in 2017 overall. In the first 11 months of the year, a total of 1.58m cars rolled off UK production lines, down 2% compared with the same point in 2016. Vehicles destined for the UK market were down 9% over the period, to 322,551, while those destined for export markets were roughly flat at 1.25m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. November was another poor month for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry, which has been hit by falling demand in 2017 as consumers faced with Brexit uncertainty and falling real pay become less willing to splash out on big purchases. The number of cars made in British factories last month and destined for the UK market plunged 28% to 24,276 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the fourth month in a row of falling domestic demand, and the biggest drop of 2017. There was however a 1.3% rise in cars made in the UK and destined for export markets, as other economies fare better than Britain. Cars built to be shipped abroad totalled 137,214 and accounted for 85% of the total. Overall, car production fell 4.6% in November, as 161,490 cars left UK factories. The figures underline just how reliant on foreign trade the UK car industry is. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: Brexit uncertainty, coupled with confusion over diesel taxation and air quality plans, continues to impact domestic demand for new cars and, with it, production output. Whilst it is good to see exports grow in November, this only reinforces how overseas demand remains the driving force for UK car manufacturing. Clarity on the nature of our future overseas trading relationships, including details on transition arrangements with the EU, is vital for future growth and success.

So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up this blog. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122lll be back next week, for the final sprint to the new year. We hope you have a lovely Christmas. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The bitcoin selloff is gathering pace. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down around $3,000 today at $12,900 -- a bitter blow to anyone who bought at almost $20,000 this week. The selloff comes as Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top lieutenant, Charlie Munger, adds his voice to the chorus of warnings against digital currencies. CNBC has the details: Munger, 93, was asked for his views on cryptocurrencies during a University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ross School of Business event. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it is perfectly asinine to even pause to think about them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Munger said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad people, crazy bubble, bad idea, luring people into the concept of easy wealth without much insight or work. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last thing on earth you should think about \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a whole lot of things that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to work for you. Figure out what they are and avoid them like the plague. And one of them is bitcoin. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It is total insanity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The interview was published Wednesday on the business school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouTube channel. It is not clear when exactly the event was held, but the video has largely gone unnoticed with roughly 7,000 views as of Friday morning. Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says the bitcoin price action resembles Las Vegas: After a record high on Sunday where bitcoin fell just short of $20,000, it has now fallen by $3000 in just a few hours and today it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly valued at $13,500. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the type of volatility we are getting used to seeing from the Cryptocurrency and it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise anyone, if it was to recover even by the end of the day The people selling the coin believe they are getting a good deal, and then those buying it believe they are getting it at a good price. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing to fuel the unpredictability of the market and more and more people are getting involved. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like red or black in the casino. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP figures: Spending by UK households slowed to its lowest level in almost six years during 2017 as the impact of higher inflation hit living standards. The Office for National Statistics said spending in the third quarter was up by 1% on the same period in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the weakest annual growth since the first three months of 2012. In its latest update on the state of the economy, the ONS reported growth of 0.4% in the third quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unchanged on its previous estimates but slightly higher than the 0.3% recorded in each of the first two quarters. Revisions to previous data meant, however, that annual growth in the year to the third quarter has been adjusted up from 1.5% to 1.7%. Household spending increased 0.5% between the second and third quarters but was boosted by consumers running down their savings during a period when real incomes were squeezed by price rises running ahead of pay. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said the ONS figures revealed a more balanced growth picture, with household spending revised down but business investment revised up from 0.2% to 0.5%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy looks to have maintained this pace in Q4,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hollingsworth added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This should mean that GDP growth for 2017 as a whole should come in at about 1.8%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... Santa isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying an early visit to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. All the major European bourses are as red as Rudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nose, with Spain leading the fallers as pro-independence parties celebrate the Catalan election. But the Spanish IBEX is still only down around 1.2% - so hardly a crash. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, the German, French and Italian stock markets are up over 10% this year, and Spain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far behind (up 8.9%). Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Catalonian regional elections may have delivered another awkward pro-independence message for PM Rajoy in Madrid, but as has been the case for the last year, if not longer, investors are happy to keep looking past geopolitical risk. Think of all we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen and heard. And look at where we are. A roller coaster it may have been, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thicker skinned for it and nursing handsome gains. Might 2018 deliver more of the same? Hopes that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market might hit a new record high in the final session before Christmas have been dashed. The FTSE 100 has just closed down 11 points, or -0.15%, at 7592, in a rather quiet trading session. Next, the retailer, was the top risers -- suggesting traders think it may be enjoying a good festive season. David Madden of CMC Markets says that consumer stocks were in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, despite this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns that households are going deeper into debt..... Bitcoin investors may be feeling blue today. The cryptocurrency has suffered a heavy selloff, shedding up to $2,000 to around $13,400 in a bout of volatile trading. This means bitcoin has lost a quarter of its value since the start of the week, amid growing signs that regulators and governments might be cracking down on digital currencies. So why the sudden selloff? Kerim Derhalli, founder and CEO of finance app Invstr, has a theory: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric price rise is mostly due to the highly illiquid nature of the current market. There are very few Bitcoin available to buy on the open, which pushes prices up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with illiquidity comes volatility. Even small changes to the market, in terms of either supply of Bitcoin or investor confidence, can have a big effect in prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear yet what happened here, but it is possible that someone with a large stockpile of Bitcoin made it available to the market. This increase in availability could have initially driven prices down, with other holders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those that bought at the top of the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c panicked into offloading as a result. Anyone who bought bitcoin at the start of 2017, for around $1,000, is still sitting on gains, of course (as long as they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost the password for their bitcoin wallet). Pensions Partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Charlie Bilello points out that bitcoin has now suffered five slumps this year. The previous four were shaken off quite quickly..... The Greek government says it will not drop its crackdown against homeowners who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repay their debts, despite last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explosion in Athens. Addressing parliament today the national economy ministry Dimitiris Papadimitriou said the leftist-led government was determined to tackle strategic defaulters who had deliberately elected not to pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large loans to build villas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he insisted that no primary home was at risk of being seized. Papadimitriou says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has pledged to protect primary homes and will continue to do so. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No heavily indebted household is at risk. Those who are in danger are the debtors who took out large loans to build villas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A new law would be passed tackling defaulters in the next three months, he told the House. With just 10 minutes of the trading day to go, the FTSE 100 has dropped back from its earlier record high. The index is now down 1 point at 7602.... Getting back to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The final figures for the third quarter paint a picture of a significantly weaker domestic economy but a more positive exports performance. Weaker government spending and a marginal downward revision to consumer spending were offset by an upward revision to investment and a rise in exports, as companies took advantage of the weak pound and bourgeoning growth momentum in many of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key trading partners. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account position improved as a result. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending was a key driver of growth in the third quarter, however the rise in spending centred on households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 basic needs such as electricity, gas and fuel, as well as housing rent and transport. Spending on discretionary treats like restaurants and hotels actually declined, as a squeeze on real incomes made consumers more careful with their spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With consumer spending remaining under pressure next year, exporters will need to play a significant role in propelling UK economic growth, despite uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationships once it leaves from the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The company that makes Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Glacier Mints has been bought by the maker of Jacob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biscuits in a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100m (\u00c2\u00a389m). Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Valeo Foods Group, which is already home to Rowse honey and Balconi Italian cakes, on Friday signed a deal to buy the British and Czech confectionary operations of Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Raisio. Included in the deal are the brands Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Poppets and Pedro. Seamus Kearney, chief executive of Valeo, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are very excited about the opportunities to expand and grow the acquired businesses through a combination of significant new capital and brand investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, there has been major bomb blast outside Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeals court just days after parliament passed tough measures penalising anti-bailout protestors who regularly gather at court hearings. Police are reporting extensive damage but no injuries. Helena Smith reports from Athens The powerful explosive device, which ripped through the court complex just meters away from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s police headquarters, is being linked to mounting anger over the contentious issue of property auctions. Courts are often the scene of violent protests when auctions of properties occur, with enraged owners attacking clerks and public notaries assigned to push them through. This week the leftist-led government passed legislation penalising protestors who resorted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153criminal acts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of violence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a miracle that no one was hurt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a police spokesman adding that guards had been alerted to the bomb after a local leftwing newspaper received a warning call shortly before the explosion at 3 AM. Foreclosures have been demanded by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout creditors as part of efforts to deal with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record stock of non-performing loans - which is the worst in the EU, at around 50% of debt. Much of the bad debt has been attributed to strategic defaulters. The explosion is not only embarrassing for authorities but will put huge pressure on the government now perceived to have reneged on earlier promises to protect the thousands of Greeks who hit by austerity are unable to honour mortgage payments. The rise in household borrowing will fuel concerns that some UK families are dangerously in debt. City fund manager Toby Nangle yesterday tweeted this chart, showing where the debt burden is falling: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also written two interesting blog posts, showing that the key issue for policymakers is how this debt is concentrated. He imagines two fictional countries - Feudaland, where most households owe a small amount of debt to a few creditors, and Debtzania, where most households are creditors but a few are deeply in debt. In Feudaland, there is much less risk to financial stability - even though most people are borrowers. As Toby puts it: Feudaland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth inequality might eventually prove politically unsustainable, but it would be hard to call it financially unsustainable, even in an environment where interest rates doubled. Despite exactly the same aggregate debt-metrics, Debtzania looks much more financially fragile than Feudaland. More here: Reverse ferret on household debt and here: Household Debt in the UK Although the upward revision to UK growth is obviously welcome, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being overshadowed by the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s households have fallen deeper into debt. Nicholas Megaw of the FT explains why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worry: Consumer spending has held up better than many economists had expected since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, despite rising inflation and sluggish wage growth weighing on real incomes. But Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data provide further evidence that consumers are increasingly taking on debt to maintain their consumption levels. Net borrowing by households increased 75 per cent quarter on quarter to \u00c2\u00a32.8bn. The figures marked the first time households have been net borrowers for four successive quarters since records began in 1987. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Atkinson is also concerned by the squeeze on UK consumers, saying: The news on growth highlights the twin pressures facing the U.K., both of them relating to Brexit. Disposable incomes rose just 0.2 percent from a year earlier after adjusting for inflation, which has been driven higher by the fall in sterling since the vote to leave the EU. Consumer spending climbed 1 percent, the least in 5 1/2 years. The ONS also said that households have paid out more money than they received for four consecutive quarters, the first time that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened since records began in 1987. Companies, meanwhile, remain reluctant to spend until there is greater clarity about life outside the EU. Business investment increased an annual 1.7 percent, the worst reading for more than a year. Despite it being nearly Christmas, some City experts are still on duty and reacting to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s updated UK GDP report. Capital Economics say Britain is on track to beat growth forecasts this year: Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, agrees that the UK has done better than feared in 2017: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance has been rather better than the gloomy talk would suggest. Growth has come in stronger than expected a year ago and the pace of activity has edged up since July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A year ago the near-universal view was that unemployment would rise in 2017; instead it has fallen by 150,000 and the jobless rate is at a 42 year low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A whopping sterling devaluation certainly has squeezed spending power and incomes, just as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also helped reboot manufacturing output. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, growth has slowed modestly, not collapsed. Talk of an end to UK growth has been somewhat exaggerated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal economist, awards the report three Christmas tree emojis: But Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says Britain is still in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with households squeezed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153higher inflation and muted earnings growth. Furthermore, employment dipped in the third quarter. Consequently, real household disposable income rose by just 0.2% in the third quarter while the household savings ratio dipped to 5.2% in the third quarter from 5.6% in the second quarter. Jamie McGeever of Reuters isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the upward revision to UK growth: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report also shows that UK households are suffering from the impact of rising inflation. Household spending growth slowed to just 1.0% over the last year, the weakest pace in five years, and down from a previous estimate of +1.6%. And despite that slowdown, families were forced to dip into their savings and run up more debt, to cover the fact that wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping pace with inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: Real household disposable income quarter on previous quarter growth was 0.2% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2017 as a result of an increase in wages and salaries, partially offset by the rise in prices experienced by households. Real household disposable income growth in 2016 has been revised down to flat from 0.1%, as previously published. The saving ratio fell to 5.2% in Quarter 3 2017, due mainly to the growth in households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending exceeding the growth in households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 income. In the non-financial account, the net borrowing position of households increased in the latest quarter. Households have now been net borrowers for four successive quarters for the first time since records began in 1987. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report confirms that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now expanded for 19 quarters in a row: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector enjoyed the strongest growth over the last quarter, but the construction sector shrank: agriculture increased by 0.8% production increased by 1.3% construction decreased by 0.5% services increased by 0.4% Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown faster than expected over the last 12 months. The Office for National Statistics has revised up its estimate for year-on-year growth in the last quarter, to 1.7% from 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the ONS now thinks the UK economy grew faster than previously thought in the six months after the Brexit vote. Business investment was stronger than first thought. It rose by 1.7% over the last 12 months, the ONS says, up from a previous estimate of 1.3% Head of National Accounts Darren Morgan says that Most of the growth came from the dominant service sector, with accounting, recruitment agencies and retailing all performing well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing also boosted growth thanks to an increase in exports and the introduction of new car models. Meanwhile, household spending and business investment both grew steadily. On a quarterly basis, UK GDP rose by 0.4% - unchanged on the previous estimate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slower than France, whose quarterly growth was revised up to 0.6% this morning, and Germany which expanded by a robust 0.8% in July to September. More to follow.... Spanish bond prices have hit a one-month low, as the renewed political uncertainty worries traders. This pushed the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Spanish bonds to 1.5% - the highest level since November (yields rise when prices fall). The euro has also slipped following the Catalan election results; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 0.2% at $1.185. Jane Foley of Rabobank says financial markets had hoped that the regional election would take Catalan independence off the agenda. Clearly that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not happened, so traders are rethinking about the whole issue. As Foley puts it: The markets have to reevaluate what it means for Spain, and does it mean anything for other countries - such as the Italian election in the spring. She believes that Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth will help to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpaper over the cracks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in its political system. But the Catalonia independence movement is just part of a wider issue, of nationalism and regionalism, that will continue to affect Europe in the next few years. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shaken off worries about Catalonia, and hit a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has climbed to 7,611 points, around 5 points above last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close. Perhaps yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSanta Rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite run out of steam yet. The Catalan crisis is likely to worry credit rating agencies, says Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale: Pro-independence parties got enough votes to win a slim majority in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, a result that is more an embarrassment for PM Rajoy than a victory for the separatists, given the small majority. Still, it lowers the chance of a rating upgrade any time soon in Spain. This chart shows how the three pro-independence parties claimed 70 of the 135 seats on offer in the Catalan election. Former first minister Carles Puigdemont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s Together for Catalonia (JxCAT) party won 34 seats - two more than rival independence party the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear whether Puigdemont could be reappointed as first minister, as he faces arrest if he returns from Belgium - where he fled last month. Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence says the process of electing a new first minister will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far from straightforward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds that Spanish politics looks a lot less certain: The biggest loser of Election Night was the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Party (PP) of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which obtained only 3 seats, with Ciudadanos stealing a substantial number of voters away from Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling party. More crucially, Ciudadanos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 victory in Catalonia will likely give the party of Albert Rivera additional momentum in opinion polls on the national level. This means that Rajoy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose PP does not have a majority in the Spanish parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has a strong incentive to avoid an early general election. However, whether he is able to do so will depend on the negotiations on a new budget with other parties that will take place early next year, which the Catalan situation will continue to complicate. In sum, 2018 will likely be the year in which it will become clearer whether or not Rajoy can survive for a full term. Spanish banks are leading the fallers. Banco de Sabadell and CaixaBank - the two biggest banks in Catalonia - have both shed at least 3%. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX index had plunged by 140 points, in early trading to 10,164 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decline of almost 1.4%. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the Catalan election results have triggered an early selloff: The calling of regional elections in Catalonia, Spain, appears to have backfired for the Spanish Government as the pro-independence parties won enough seats to form a regional coalition government. The three pro-independence parties won 70 of the 135 seats, crucially ahead of the 68 needed. However, it remains to be seen whether these three parties are able to create a government between them. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the of the word economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final trading day before Christmas. Traditionally, a calm time in the City as traders count this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winnings (or losses) and head to the pubs after trading ends at lunchtime. But not this year. Instead, European markets have been rattled by the news that Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-independence parties have retained their majority in the snap election held yesterday. Separatist parties won 70 of the 135 seats in the Barcelona parliament (even though the centre-right, pro-unionist Citizens party actually came first). This is a major embarrassment for Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PM, Mariano Rajoy, and a significant boost to the independence movement who are pushing for Catalonia to break away. Less than two months ago, Rajoy dissolved the previous parliament after it declared independence. This is going to spark a wave of selling in Madrid, and also weaken Spanish government bond prices. Reuters has the details: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX futures opened down 1.2 percent before tumbling further, last down 1.8 percent and indicating a sharp fall at the open as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political crisis, which has damaged the economy and caused a business exodus from Catalonia,deepened. Spanish bond yields also edged higher in early deals. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year borrowing costs were up 4 basis points, to 1.515%. Euro zone stocks were also set for a downbeat open with Euro STOXX 50 futures down 0.5%. This latest twist is also likely to drag Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE down from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high (the blue-chip index closed over 7,600 points for the first time at 7,603). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite clear what will happen next in Spain, as my colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: Much will now depend on what the pro-independence parties agree. Puigdemont is facing arrest if he returns to Spain and fractures have appeared between him and Junqueras, who has appeared to take a more moderate line on independence. The vote is the latest chapter in Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. The results will be bruising for Rajoy and will do nothing to heal divisions in the region, which remains deeply and evenly divided over the independence issue. Any solution to the vexed question of Catalan sovereignty remains as elusive as ever. Also coming up today, we get a final estimate of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performance in the third quarter of this year. These national accounts are likely to confirm that GDP rose by 0.4% in July to September, and will also show business investment and the balance of payments. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: Final estimate of UK GDP for the third quarter of 2017 1.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP for October 1.30pm GMT: US durable goods and personal income figures",

Shopkeepers continue to face severe difficulties, with growing competition from online businesses and a squeeze on household finances, as well as hefty rate bills.

So look out this coming week for any retail profit warnings, with companies obliged to update the stock market as soon as they know they will not meet City expectations. Last year saw a warning from Next about its poor Christmas performance that sent the whole sector into a tailspin, while previous years had seen the likes of Game Digital, Sports Direct and Debenhams report worse-than-expected seasonal sales. As it happens, Next was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Friday: so perhaps we should expect good news this time.

                "bodyText":"Right, time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed at a new peak tonight, on the first trading day since Christmas. The FTSE 100 hit a record closing high, propelled by mining companies as optimism for the world economy in 2018 boosted commodity prices. The smaller FTSE 250 also finished at its highest ever level, partly due to a takeover bid for office manager IWG (which closed 27% higher). The rally came as new data showed that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 richest people had collectively gained $1tn in 2017. But it was a volatile day for bitcoin. After surging 13% yesterday, the digital currency has fallen back this afternoon. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 4% at $15,094 - having been valued at almost $20,000 10 days ago. This latest fluctuation came after Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market regulator suggested it could ban cryptocurrency firms from listing on the Tel Aviv exchange. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The jump in commodity prices today helped to push the FTSE 100 to its record high, thanks to the various mining giants that are included in the index. Sky News explains: The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of record highs is less impressive once you remember the tumble in sterling 18 months ago. The pound is still worth around 10% less than before the EU referendum; that made UK companies more affordable to overseas investors, and pumped up the value of their foreign earnings. Peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft tweets: The smaller, more domestically focused FTSE 250 has also hit a new record high tonight: Newsflash: the FTSE 100 index has closed at a new all time high of 7,620 points. Mining companies and supermarkets helped the index rise on the first trading day since Christmas. Newsflash: US consumer confidence has fallen back from its recent highs. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of consumer confidence, just released, dropped to 122.1 in December, down from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 129.5 - which was the highest in 17 years. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decline in confidence was fueled by a somewhat less optimistic outlook for business and job prospects in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The wheels are coming off Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The crypocurrency is now down over 4% at $15,080, which means it has shed over $1,000 since this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early bounce. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened very slightly higher as traders return to work after the Christmas break. The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 16 points, or 0.07%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also managed minuscule gains. While mining companies drove the FTSE 100 to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high, engineering firm Rolls-Royce, building materials group Ferguson, broadcaster Sky and holiday firm TUI all held it back: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high, following the lead set by its little brother, the FTSE 250. The index of the biggest companies listed in London has risen by 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7615 - nudging over the previous intraday record set last Friday. The jump in commodity prices today, such as copper, has pushed mining stocks up (silver miner Fresnillo is the top performer, up almost 3%), with other natural resource companies also up. This means the FTSE 100 has gained around 6.6% this year, lagging behind other indexes such as the US Dow Jones (+25%), Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX (+13%) or the Hong Kong Hang Seng (+34%). Maybe it was the prospect of Mrs Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boys as the highlight of TV on Christmas Day - but according to official HMRC figures, a total of 2,590 people said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbah humbug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the festivities and decided to spend the day filling in and submitting their tax return instead. Even as millions of kids across the globe were transfixed by Santa trackers on their computers, in the last hour of Christmas Eve, 92 grown-ups were instead glued to the HMRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homepage and sent in their tax returns between 23.00 and midnight. On Boxing Day, a further 7,655 returns arrived at HMRC. HMRC issued the figures as it began its annual plea to the 11m people in Britain who must complete a self-assessment form by January 31. This year it has a new advertising campaign, featuring ducks, of course. The strapline is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let your tax returns peck away at you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quackers. Via City AM, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a list of the billionaires who gained the most wealth in 2017. The full table is online here. Meanwhile a new poll in Greece has revealed that most citizens are not buying the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheery vision of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean exit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from international supervision when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout programme officially ends next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens In theory, Greeks should be going into the new year on an optimistic note. After seven years of gruelling austerity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the price of three economic adjustment programmes that have kept the debt stricken country afloat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest bailout officially expires in August 2018. But the excoriating terms attached to financial rescue won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end there, with the result that most Greeks are not buying government assertions of post-bailout bliss come the summer. Instead, a poll conducted on behalf of the Real News newspaper by MRB Hellas found that 66.3% of respondents are convinced that international monitoring of Greek finances will continue in some form. A mere 17% accept the official version: that Greece will make a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean exit,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weaning itself off borrowed funds by returning to international capital markets. Under that scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one vividly expanded by prime minister Alexis Tsipras \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Athens will have completed a compliance review in time for the country to build up a cash buffer that would enable it to return to markets and begin debt relief talks by the summer. However, only one in four Greeks expect a market return. Three out of five don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Greece would be able to tap markets to cover debt payments, according to the survey. Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, has hit a new alltime high. The FTSE 250 has gained 59 points to 20,540 this morning, putting it ahead of the previous record high set on 22 December. Offices group International Workplace Group (IWG) is leading the rally; its shares have jumped by almost 30% today after receiving a takeover offer from Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Onex and Brookfield Asset Management. The FTSE 100 is also close to a record high today, up 13 points at 7606. Other European markets are lagging, though, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX down 0.3% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX down 0.2%. Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explains: Miners are leading the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge higher after Copper traded a fresh three and half year high on Christmas Day, however a significant contribution from Oilers, the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest sector, is aiding the latest foray in record territory. Continued concern as to the impact of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Catalonian election victory for pro-independence parties, as well as a Euro recovery from its Christmas Day \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, are both weighing on mainland European equities, while US futures are clawing back gains following a negative Boxing day session impacted by an Apple sell-off. Commodity price are charging ahead today (doubtless pleasing billionaires in the raw materials sector). The copper price has hit its highest level in over three years, partly due to optimism that the strengthening global economy will push up demand. The prospect of supply cuts was also a factor - with China ordering its top producer to halt output for a week to combat winter pollution. Metal prices are also rising because the US dollar has weakened (as traders ponder the consequences of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan). Palladium has hit a 17-year high, at $1,069 per ounce, while gold rose to $1.285 per ounce. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roster of billionaires includes Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss, the internet entrepreneurs who made a big investment in bitcoin back in 2011. Their $11m investment is probably worth around $1.3bn today - although their precise fortune is obviously as volatile as bitcoin itself. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA predicts more wild price moves next year.... Bitcoin is going to continue to fascinate traders heading into the new year and while volatility by its own standards has been tame today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to remain very active. Speculators appetite for Bitcoin has been tested in the run up to Christmas, with price having fallen from around $20,000 to not far from half that less than a week later, depending on the exchange. While prices have since rebounded back to around $15,000, it will be interesting to see whether we see the kind of wild gains that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve become accustomed to in the coming months, or whether the recent decline has shaken people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in the cryptocurrency. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest people needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about their incomes being squeezed, though. New figures from Bloomberg show that the 500 richest people in the world saw their respective wealth expand by an astonishing 23% during 2017, from $4.4 trillion to over $5.3 trillion. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, had the best year - gaining over $34bn to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person at around $99.6bn, thanks to the surge in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. The report also shows that lesser (!) billionaires also had a vintage year, as the strong gains on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets made the richest even richer (at a time when the average household in the UK was suffering from falling real wages) Here are some of the key points from Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: The 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index added $177 billion in 2017, a 65 percent gain that was the biggest of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of developer China Evergrande Group, added $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year, and the second-biggest U.S. dollar gain on the index, after Bezos. Technology billionaire Ma Huateng, co-founder of messaging service Tencent Holdings, became Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-richest person when his fortune nearly doubled to $41 billion. The number of Asian billionaires surpassed the U.S. for the first time, according to a UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The U.S. has the largest presence on the index, with 159 billionaires who added $315 billion, an 18 percent gain that gives them a collective net worth of $2 trillion. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 27 richest people put behind them the economic pain that followed President Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2014 annexation of Crimea, adding $29 billion to $275 billion, surpassing the collective net worth they had before western economic sanctions began. It was also a banner year for tech moguls, with the 57 technology billionaires on the index adding $262 billion, a 35 percent increase that was the most of any sector on the ranking. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story, which could fuel calls for higher wealth taxes to tackle the growing gap between the richest and everyone else. Hmmm, bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally seems to be fizzling out. The digital currency has now dipped back to around $15,500 - wiping out this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. This sort of volatility is typical for bitcoin, but maybe the threat of a regulatory clampdown is worrying the market. FXTM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hussein Sayed says there are several reasons to be cautious: Israel became the most recent country to propose banning companies based on digital currencies to trade on its stock exchange. A South Korean bitcoin exchange has been hacked, leading it into bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency exchanges are disabling transaction temporarily due to high traffic. Professional traders on CBOE seems to be going short on Bitcoin. Britain should brace itself for another year of falling real wages. In news that might take the sparkle off your new year celebrations, the Resolution Foundation has predicted that pay rises won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overtake inflation until the end of next year. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, that would mean the current cost of living squeeze will last two whole years. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, blames the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Resolution Foundation report succinctly encapsulates the hardship many across Britain are facing under the Tories and will continue to face in 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After seven years of Conservative economic mismanagement, the figures speak for themselves. Real wages are still lower than they were in 2010 and Britain faces a productivity crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a Government willing or able to raise productivity and living standards for people in Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tech companies are suffering a hangover this morning, following reports that sales of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new iPhone X have been disappointing. Yesterday Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Economic Daily reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter to 30 million units, down from 50 million. This hit Asian chip makers overnight, and European technology companies are now following - sending the Stoxx 600 tech index down 1%. Austrian-based Apple supplier AMS is the biggest casualty, down almost 10% We had been expecting new UK mortgage data today, but it turns out that the figures are actually being released by UK Finance (the industry body) tomorrow. As predicted, European stock markets are rather quiet after the Christmas break. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a modest four points (perhaps traders are being distracted by the snowflakes that are now sweeping through the capital). Mining companies are leading the risers; Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American have all gained around 1.5% while silver producer Fresnillo is up 2%. Jeremy Cook of World First sums up the situation: Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stumble last week came after two exchanges, CME and Cboe, both launched futures markets allowing investors to bet against the cryptocurrency - as this tweet shows: Shares in cryptocurrency-related companies have also risen today, on the back of bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound. Reuters has the details: Internet provider GMO Internet Inc, which is engaged in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mining\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bitcoin, rose 3.1%. Remixpoint Inc, an operator of virtual currency trading post services, gained 5%. The bitcoin futures price has also rebounded from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump. On CME Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new bitcoin derivatives market, the price of a bitcoin in January has risen by $430 today to $16,250. The bitcoin futures prices allow traders to bet on bitcoin falling, or rising, in value. As things stand, bitcoin has gained around 1,600% during 2017, despite last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wobble. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that bitcoin looks like a bubble -- partly because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so hard to put a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 value on it. He writes: After crashing by more than $8,000 from an all-time high, Bitcoin is up 3.5% at the time of writing. Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December. Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no effective test to measure at which stage we are currently standing. For example, equity prices may be said in a bubble territory if investors are willing to pay much more for a stock than the intrinsic value which is justified by the discounted divided stream. Similarly, econometric tests may be run on bonds, commodities, currencies or any other asset to come up with a justified value. For Bitcoin, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any fundamental basis to justify the price. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a subdued atmosphere in the City of London this morning as traders struggle through the drizzle back to their desks following the Christmas break. But bitcoin is defying the quiet mood, and staging a strong recovery after its sharp plunge last week which saw it fall from around $19,000 to just $14,000 in two days. The price of bitcoin surged by 13% on Tuesday, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extending those gains again this morning - currently changing hands at around $16,200. That should relieve those who jumped into the cryptocurrency arena in recent weeks, but may also spur concerns that the bitcoin bubble is still inflating. The rally comes despite another crackdown against bitcoin, this time from Israel. On Monday, Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market regulator revealed plans to ban companies based on digital currencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, declared that the public need to be protected from potentially unscrupulous bitcoin operations: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we have a company that their main business is digital currencies we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hauser, who clearly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fan of bitcoin, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it looks like a bubble, smells like a bubble, acts like a bubble and feels like a bubble. This tough stance may embolden other regulators to take a closer look at bitcoin, which could mean further volatility in the weeks ahead. Apart from bitcoin, City traders will also be watching out for new UK home loan data this morning, and US consumer confidence stats this afternoon (unless they slope off early to finish off the mince pies). The agenda: 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals data for November 3pm GMT: US Consumer Confidence index for December Update: the mortgage approvals figures have been pushed back to Thursday.",

However, as the big investors cut back on their European exposure, one of the big themes of this year, there will be plenty of opportunities for ordinary investors to pick up bargains and gain exposure to one of the healthier parts of the global economy, assuming they can stomach the potential volatility from various elections.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a451828e4b038bfdd3e5a1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-28T16:14:51.319Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over with bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is off its lows of the day but still down nearly 8% at $14,152.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a45061ae4b02fb295f84ba8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-28T14:59:40.181Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the Chicago data, Jamie Satchi, economist at MNI Indicators, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sentiment among businesses started 2017 in good shape and only impressed more as the year progressed.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 may have hit a new closing peak, supported by rising commodity prices, but it was a more mixed picture elsewhere. In rather muted trading ahead of the new year break, most European markets slipped back, while Wall Street is holding on to its early gains. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.03% at 7622.88 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.69% to 12,979.94 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.55% lower at 5339.42 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.36% to 22,120.95 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.71% at 10,093.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.26% to 799.05 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 35 points or 0.14%. Meanwhile bitcoin is down just over 9% at $13,941. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the last trading session of the year. Breaking news: The FTSE 100 has hit another record closing high - but only just. The index ended the last full trading day of the year (tomorrow traders knock off work at 12.30) up a magnificent 0.03% at 7622.88. Earlier, it also managed an intra-day high of 7633.55 before slipping back from that peak. Wall Street is still in positive territory, but European markets are drifting lower as we head to the close. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The final full session of the year has seen European markets drop slightly, with an absence of catalysts prompting a drift to the downside. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to hold above 7600 should come as encouragement to UK investors, even with several heavyweights going ex-dividend today. However, stocks on the continent have continued their sideways pattern of the past two weeks, as they look ahead into a 2018 that will see the ECB cut back its monthly purchase levels and a host of political issues. However, as the big investors cut back on their European exposure, one of the big themes of this year, there will be plenty of opportunities for ordinary investors to pick up bargains and gain exposure to one of the healthier parts of the global economy, assuming they can stomach the potential volatility from various elections. Over with bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is off its lows of the day but still down nearly 8% at $14,152. On the Chicago data, Jamie Satchi, economist at MNI Indicators, said: Sentiment among businesses started 2017 in good shape and only impressed more as the year progressed. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result secured the MNI Chicago Business Barometer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first full year of expansion since 2014 and with new orders ending the quarter in fine shape there is every chance this form could be carried over into 2018. Some strong US data, in the shape of the Chicago purchasing managers index. The index has jumped from 63.9 in November to 67.6 in the final month of the year. This is far better than the decline to 62 which had been expected, and marks the highest level since March 2011. US markets are on the rise, helped by a weaker dollar and a rally in commodity prices, although trading is thin in the run up to the new year break. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 39 points or 0.15% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.14% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.21%. Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market remains strong, with just 245,000 people filing new claims for unemployment benefit last week. Although more than expected, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a low figure by historical standards. Bitcoin is on track to post its ninth daily fall in 12 days. Bitcoin has now clawed its way back over $14,000, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down over 7% today since South Korea announced its clampdown (details here). Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says regulatory threats have triggered the selloff, but points out that bitcoin has suffered similar slumps before. He says: After forming a high of $16,416 this week, the cryptocurrency came under a selling pressure as traders showed their reaction to South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. The country is determined to curb the speculative market and it would take measures to stop and review various crypto-exchanges. The reality is that the market is way too overheated and no one wants the cryptocurrency popping on their door steps. However, this is surely not the first time that we have witnessed this kind of reaction in the Bitcoin price. Throughout this years, we have heard many similar messages (followed by actions) from China and yet Bitcoin made a high of $19,338 [earlier this month]. But.... Craig Erlam of Oanda suspects that anxiety over bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future may be rising..... Bitcoin is coming under selling pressure once again, with efforts by South Korean authorities to rein in speculation being blamed.... While this is likely a contributing factor, I wonder if given the pre-holiday drop, whether speculators have become more sensitive to negative news. We saw plenty of this in reverse on the way up, with positive news triggering significant rises and negative news being brushed aside. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise me if we see prices heading back below $10,000 before they find their feet again. Readers might assume that shares in London are up because the pound is having one of its wobbles (because a falling pound boosts the profits of multinational companies listed in London). But actually, sterling is up 0.25% against the US dollar today, at $1.343. And during 2017 as a whole, the pound has gained over 8% against the greenback, having started the year at $1.235. The dollar is losing ground against most currencies today. Some traders are fretting that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cuts to US corporation tax will push America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit higher, prompting even more borrowing. Another factor is that US consumer confidence dropped yesterday, which might signal some economic softness next year. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has also hit a new all-time high. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up a modest 23 points at 29,663. Familiar names like baking firm Greggs (+2.2%) and transport group Stobart (+1.9%) are among the risers. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high! The Footsie has gained another 13 points, in a quiet trading session, hitting 7,633 points for the first time ever. Mining stocks such as Rio Tinto and Anglo American are up this morning, as commodity prices rise thanks to the weak dollar (as investors react to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts). UK retailer Next and supermarket chain J Sainsbury are also in the top risers (up around 0.8% each). The FTSE 100 has gained more than 6.6% during 2017 - a solid performance, but one that is overshadowed by European and US markets. US companies involved in the blockchain - the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdigital ledger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 technology that underpins bitcoin - are also under pressure in premarket trading. Reuters reports that Riot Blockchain is down 7.7% premarket, LongFin Corp has lost 5.7% percent, Overstock.com has dipped by 4.8%, while Nova LifeStyle has shed 4.1%. Yikes, a sudden squall of selling just swept bitcoin down to $13,500, wiping a few hundred dollar off its value in under a minute. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now clawing its way back, though -- a reminder of how volatile digital currencies can be (not an ideal characteristic in a store of value...) Bitcoin update: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently bobbing around $13,990 on the BitStamp exchange in Luxembourg, down 8.5% so far today (and 28% below last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs). Looking away from bitcoin, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned that UK mortgage approvals dropped to a 15-month low last month. Just 39,507 home purchase loans were approved in November, down from 41,702 a year ago, according to industry body UK Finance. That may show that the market is cooling, as the Bank of England raised interest rates at the start of November from 0.25% to 0.5%. Today the financial markets are mostly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153watching Bitcoin (fanatics vs the controlling tendencies of governments and central banks) and dealing with year-end tidying-up operations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: The Financial Times says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clampdown shows South Korea is keen to take some heat out of its domestic bitcoin market: The measures include a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts to boost transparency and legislation to allow regulators to close digital currency exchanges if needed, a recommendation made by the justice ministry worried about scams involving cryptocurrency trading. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The regulator is saying to exchanges to have proper cyber security and proper know-your-client processes in place,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Cedric Jeanson, chief executive of BitSpread, a cryptocurrency market maker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the market overheating in Korea, it is quite natural that the regulator thinks, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s make sure this is done properly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government noted that most virtual currencies were trading at a premium on South Korean exchanges, despite a string of regulatory measures announced by the government this month designed to cool demand. South Korean traders are paying about 30 per cent over international rates for bitcoin, reflecting the popularity of the asset in the country and the difficulty in arbitraging among markets. Koreans prefer to use bitcoin exchanges in their home country rather than the US because they need to open a bank account in the US to buy the currency in that market \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a cumbersome requirement. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new curbs on bitcoin come just nine days after a Seoul-based digital currency exchange declared itself bankrupt after being hacked for the second time. The Youbut exchange shut down after losing 17% of its assets in a cyber attack which was later blamed on North Korean hackers. Earlier this month, a cryto-mining marketplace called NiceHash said it had also been hacked, losing around 4,700 bitcoins. Both incidences highlighted one potential problem with digital currencies. Bitcoin futures are also falling sharply today, on CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new derivatives platform (launched last week). The January bitcoin contract has shed $640 to $14,050 - broadly matching today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 price of bitcoin. The February and March futures contracts have also dropped to similar levels. But what does that mean? Well, these derivative contracts allow investors to wager that an asset will either rise or fall in value by a certain time. So you could conclude that traders don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect bitcoin to recover much ground in the next few months. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more likely that the futures prices is basically just tracking the spot price. After all, it would take a brave investor to put their shirt on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in three months time (or three days, frankly...) European stock markets are subdued this morning, in a sharp contrast to bitcoin. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 rose by just 10 points to 7,630, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite enough to catch yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Politicians in Seoul have been fretting about bitcoin for some time, leading up to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on anonymous trading and the threat to close exchanges. Bloomberg explains: South Korea has been ground zero for a global surge in interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as prices surged this year, prompting the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister to worry over the impact on Korean youth. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no immediate indication Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No. 4 economy will shutter exchanges that have accounted by some measures for more than fifth of global trading, the news poses a warning as regulators the world over express concerns about private digital currencies. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has dragged bitcoin away from its pre-Christmas peak, but its still up around 1,400% this year. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cryptocurrency curbs suggest that officials are getting worried about the consequences of a digital currency crash. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda, says (via Bloomberg): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regulators are getting so concerned that this is primarily and predominantly a retail phenomenon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regulators not only in Asia but globally are going to start addressing this fact because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve actually come to terms with what the absolute downside of a complete drop in crypto means for the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bitcoin is suffering fresh losses today after South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government announced a clampdown on digital currencies. Bitcoin tumbled by 11% to below $14,000, meaning it has shed a quarter of its value since hitting its latest record high on 17th December. The selloff came as South Korea revealed it is taking several steps to combat speculation in cryptocurrencies. The measures include a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts, and new legislation to allow regulators to close virtual coin exchanges if needed. Bitcoin has taken South Korea by storm - reportedly, 20% of all bitcoin transactions take place in the country. The government fears that the boom has gone too far. In a statement, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Officials share the view that virtual currency trading is overheating irrationally ... and we can no longer overlook this abnormal speculative situation. South Korea is also keen to clamp down on criminals who use bitcoin to launder money, or fraudulently manipulate the price. AFP reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will ... resolutely respond to such crimes by slapping maximum sentences possible on offenders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the government said, vowing to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leave all policy options open, including closure of a cryptocurrency exchange when deemed necessary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This sent the bitcoin price reeling: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 2017 has been a good year for shares, with most stock markets posting double-digit gains. And last night, the bull market swept Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 to a new closing high of 7,620 points. Can it do it again today? Possibly -- the futures markets are suggesting that the Footsie could creep a little higher today as more traders return to the City after the Christmas break. It will probably be a quiet trading session, though, as the markets stagger towards 2018. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: With only two trading sessions remaining for 2017, liquidity dried up across the global markets. This has been obvious in U.S. and European equities, where volumes dropped significantly. However, some investors continued to tweak their portfolios slightly, leading to insignificant price action. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect equities to deviate much throughout Thursday and Friday. Investors will also be watching for the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the eurozone economy, new UK home loan figures, and fresh trade and unemployment data from America. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am GMT: European Central Bank publishes its economic bulletin 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage loans for November 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for November 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures",

But at last count Homebase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures made grim reading, with sales tumbling nearly 14% in the three months to September, a disastrous performance blamed on clearing discontinued stock. The chain lost \u00c2\u00a354m in the first full year of Wesfarmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ownership and that figure is expected to increase in the current financial year, which runs until June. Damian McGloughlin, who joined from the rival DIY chain B&amp;Q this year, would be stepping up as acting managing director, the company confirmed. Bunnings has also drafted in David Haydon from sister chain Officeworks to run Homebase. Haydon, who has worked for Wickes and B&amp;Q, will be acting chief operating officer in Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absence. With years of hard work and a lot of cash required to reinvent Homebase, there are questions mark over whether new Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott, who according to Australian press reports recently visited the UK, will be as committed to the expensive project as his predecessor Richard Goyder. John Gillam, who as boss of Bunnings was a keen supporter of the deal, has also left the group. At Wesfarmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 quarterly update in October, Bunnings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 managing director, Michael Schneider, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the performance of Homebase is disappointing, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the Bunnings pilots. We will patiently trial a range of formats, locations, and competitive environments to achieve proof of concept.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are 15 Bunnings stores in the UK, with the most recent Homebase conversion in Bicester, Oxfordshire. At just 36,700 sq ft, the Bicester branch is half the size of its big box format Bunnings Warehouse and its success will provide a template for smaller stores in the chain. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

                "bodyText":"Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses on Wall Street, global stock markets had a historic year. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, rose in every single month - the first time ever that shares have avoided a monthly decline. Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ryan Vlastelica explains: In fact, the index hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a down month since October 2016. It ended up 0.5% in December, and rose 21.8% over the course of the year. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, credited the strength to improving corporate profitability, tweeting, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why have global stocks gone up every month so far this year? Earnings have too (both actual and expected).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on that note, we really are finished for 2017. Best wishes for the new year, and goodnight! Hello again. After a rollicking year, the US stock market actually ended the final session of 2017 with some small losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to end 2017 at 24,719.22, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 index also dropped 0.5% to close the year at 2,673.61, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.7% to end at 6,903.39. But it was still a very good year for the Dow, which closed at record levels on 71 occasions - itself a record. Hello again. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the global stock market rally this year: I may pop back later with the Wall Street close, or any other major events. Either way, we wish you all the best for 2018. Happy New Year! GW Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has taken a knock, though, after Donald Trump tweeted that it was getting an unfairly generous deal from the US post service. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the tweet in question: Ding ding! Over in New York, the final trading day of the year is underway. And stocks are moving a little higher - with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 30 points or 0.12%, and the S&amp;P 500 index up 0.16%. 2017 has been a bumper year for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, with the Dow surging by 25%m, and the tech-focused Nasdaq up by nearly a third. Technology stocks had a particularly amazing year -- Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all jumped by over 50%, and Apple was close behind. Gold has had its best year since 2010, pushed up by the weaker US dollar. It just hit $1,300 for the first time since mid-October. The FTSE 100 surged by around \u00c2\u00a3141bn during 2017, according to the London stock exchange. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies, gained around \u00c2\u00a352bn as it rattled to fresh record highs. That fed into the $9 trillion surge in global share prices during this year (as measured by MSCI) Shares have been a pretty decent investment this year - giving a rather better return than your local bank. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre (a retail stockbroker) says there are reasons why shares could keep rising in 2018. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the second year in a row the FTSE100 has ended the year at an all-time high. Personal investors will have been relieved this year by a respite from the high volatility seen in the last couple of years. The level of volatility this year has though been remarkably low by historical standards and this has perhaps meant fewer trading opportunities for those investors who trade more actively. Market commentators have expressed concerns about valuation levels for some time indicating a correction may be on the horizon. However, the market appears to be shrugging off any such concerns and continuing to go from strength to strength. Higher global growth forecasts, a continuation of relatively relaxed monetary policy and a loosening of fiscal policy specifically in the United States are all helping support equities. A personal investor who put money into a FTSE 100 tracker fund at the start of this year will have seen a return of nearly 8% with a dividend payout (yield) of over 3% on top of that. With base rates now at just 0.5% and returns on cash remaining depressed the stark choice for investors seeking to drive an income from their capital is clear and this too helps drive demand for equities and equity based collectives (funds). Mining giants also had a good year, thanks to a boom in commodity prices which saw copper hit a four-year high this week. So, which shares should you have bought a year ago, and which should have come with a health warning? The best-performing share on the FTSE 100 during 2017 was actually a healthcare business based in the the United Arab Emirates, called NMC Health. It jumped by 86% during the year; any traders who backed NMC may be sprinting to the nearest City champagne bar this afternoon.... Second was Worldpay, the payments processor company spun out of the wreckage of Royal Bank of Scotland. It jumped by 57%, thanks to a takeover bid from US rival Vantiv. Housebuilders also had a strong year; Persimmon was the third-best performing member of the Footsie, up 54%, followed by Berkeley Group which gained 49%. But some companies will be glad to see the back of 2017. Centrica slumped by over 40%, partly due to a big profits warning in November, while telecommunications group BT and advertising giant WPP both shank by around a quarter. Breaking! A late burst of buy orders have sent Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index up to a new all-time high. The final trading day of 2017 ended with a flourish, with the FTSE 100 closing up 64 points or 0.85% at 7,687 points. Just before the close, it hit a new intraday high of 7697 points. This means the blue-chip index has gained 7.6% during 2017. With the smaller FTSE 250 index also closing at a new record high, this puts the seal on a good year for the London stock market. But, this still means the Footsie has lagged behind other stock markets - with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix and the US S&amp;P 500 both up around 20% during 2017. Just 10 minutes until the end of the trading year in London, and the FTSE 100 is heading towards a fresh closing high..... World stock markets have surged to a new alltime high today, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put on a blistering $9 trillion in value since the start of January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Reuters, which reports: Markets were ending 2017 in a party mood on Friday after a year in which a concerted pick-up in global growth boosted corporate profits and commodity prices, while benign inflation kept central banks from snatching away the monetary punch bowl. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world equity index, which tracks 47 countries, inched up 0.15% as six straight weeks and now 13 straight months of gains left it at yet another all time high. The index has been on an upward trajectory for pretty much all of 2017, putting it 22 percent and almost $9 trillion higher for the year. Emerging markets have led the charge with gains of 34%. Hong Kong surged 36%, South Korea notched up 22% and India and Poland both made 27% in local currency terms. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and the S&amp;P 500 are both ahead by almost 20%, while the Dow has risen by a quarter. In Europe, the German DAX has gained nearly 14 %, though the UK FTSE has lagged a little with a rise of 7%. More here: Stocks cheer $9 trillion year, downer for the dollar The euro has enjoyed its best year since 2003, thanks to the recovery in the eurozone economy. The single currency is the best performing G10 currency, according to Bloomberg data: More photos of traders celebrating the last day of trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange in Manila have arrived; it seemed wrong not to share them. Traders have plenty to celebrate -- the main Philippine stock index hit an alltime high this morning, and has gained 25% this year. That helped Asian shares to rack up their best year since 2009 (as discussed earlier). The smaller FTSE 250 index is also at record levels. It rose by 0.25% to 20,695 points, a gain of 55 points this morning. The FTSE 100 is pushing further into record territory, as City investors get their buy orders in before trading closes early at 12.30pm. The blue-chip index has now hit a fresh record high of 7,648 points, up 25 points or 0.3% today. Reuters points out that natural resourse stocks had a stonking year: Miners have been among the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-performing stocks this year, with Antofagasta up 47.4% and Glencore up 40.7% year-to-date. Elsewhere NMC Health has been the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-performing stock, while a takeover has pushed Worldpay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares 57 percent higher this year. Housebuilders Persimmon and Berkeley Group have both had a comeback year, recovering after seeing their shares plummet in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit referendum in June 2016. Technology companies have led the rally in Europe this year, mirroring the surge in Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook et al. Miners, banks and industrial companies also had a good year, as this chart shows: Like most financial assets, shares are generally held by richer people (either directly or through pension funds). So the surge in global stock markets this year won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped tackle wealth inequality. The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6% rise this year has outpaced inflation (3.1% in December) and wages (up 2.3% during 2017). And the bad news for British workers is that pay growth is likely to lag behind all other wealthy nations in 2018. 2017 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just been about rising stock markets. Brexit, Donald Trump, food safety, inequality and even a giant, sadly deceased, rabbit called Simon featured in our most popular stories this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the business news that got you all clicking this year. The strong rally in Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets this year is particularly remarkable, given the geopolitical threat posed by North Korea and the risk that president Trump could trigger a trade war. But instead, traders have shrugged off these worries - sending shares jumping across the region. As CNBC puts it: While geopolitical uncertainty was a major focal point earlier this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with several North Korean missile launches initially sending investor scurrying into safe-have assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201d risk appetite has since improved, with markets looking instead to stronger economic growth globally. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad index of shares in Asia Pacific excluding Japan was up more than 34 percent year-to-date on Friday morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s above the roughly 25 percent climb seen on the Dow Jones industrial average and 8 percent rise on the pan-European STOXX 600 over the same period. The London stock market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doing its festive best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to reach the New Year at a fresh record high, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Here are the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100, as it hovers around this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak of 7,636 points. Most global stock markets have enjoyed strong gains this year. Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, said of the 73 bourses it tracks globally, all but nine have recorded gains in local currency terms this year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Reuters). Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix share index has also enjoyed a bumper year; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risen by over 19% during 2017. Traders held a ceremony to mark the end of the trading year, and invited Go champion Yuta Iyama to ring the closing bell. European stock markets are on track to record their best year since 2013. The Stoxx 600 index has just opened flat, leaving it on track for a near-8% gain over the last 12 months. The pound is also having a good morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.35, a three-week high. Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has hit a new record at the start of trading. The blue-chip index has jumped by 13 points to 7,636, slightly over yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. It means the Footsie has risen by 4.5% during December - a month that saw Britain agree the first phase of a Brexit deal with Brussels. Just Eat, the fast food-ordering app company, is leading the risers, up 1.8%. It only joined the FTSE 100 this month, after seeing its value overtake the likes of supermarket chain J Sainsbury. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final day of the trading year, and what a year it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been for investors. Stocks have surged world wide over the last 12 months - thanks to renewed confidence in the global economy and a steady drip-drip-drip of monetary stimulus from central bankers. Over in Asia, the markets have enjoyed their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which tracks stocks across the region, has surged by almost 29% this year. Hong Kong has enjoyed a particularly exuberant year - jumping by an sparkling 36%, while South Korea posted a 22% gain and India jumped by 27%. Ceremonies have already been taking place at stock markets across Asia, including in Tokyo and Manila. Many commodities have strengthened this year too, at the expense of the weaker US dollar. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for tax cuts has not made the greenback great again. In Europe, many stock markets are already sitting on double-digit gains - Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX, for example, is up 13%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 hit fresh record highs this week, but has actually only gained around 6.7% during the year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session will end at 12.30pm. So, a solid year for shares. But could the markets be peaking? Some investors worry that the good times could end soon. For example, an index from State Street that tracks investor risk appetite suffered its six straight monthly fall in December. As Michael Metcalfe, State Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of global macro strategy, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the broader economic outlook appears increasingly rosy, as captured by measures of consumer and business confidence, the more cautious nature of investors hints at a concern that markets may have already discounted much of the good news.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the agenda (understandably), apart from new inflation figures from Germany.",

                "bodyText":"The rich got richer and the poor piled on more debt as shockwaves from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate in 2017. Billionaire George Soros dismissed Donald Trump as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153con-man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest chicken supplier was revealed to have been fiddling its food safety records. Airlines had a turbulent year, from the sad death of Simon the giant rabbit to Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock cancellation of thousands of flights after it messed up its pilot rosters. Based on the number of page views, here are our 10 most popular business stories of 2017. 1. Hard times for Whole Foods: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPeople say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for pretentious people. I can see why\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretentious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd American grocery group nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whole Paycheck\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd made it to the top of our most-read list in 2017, as takeover rumours swirled around the once high-flying, organic-focused retailer. Shoppers loved Whole Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products, but not its prices: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re shopping for the cheaper, more afofrdable things, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reminded of the things you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. A consumer backlash had led to six straight quarters of declining sales by April. Two months later online giant Amazon swooped in with a $13.7bn takeover in a bold move seen as a game-changer for the entire food retail sector. 2. Deloitte hit by cyber-attack revealing clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 secret emails In September the Guardian revealed one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big four\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd accountancy firms had been the victim of a sophisticated cybersecurity attack that had gone unnoticed for months. The attack on Deloitte compromised confidential emails and plans of some of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip clients, including household name companies and US government departments. Hackers may have accessed usernames, passwords and other personal details. 3. United Airlines \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsaddened\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by death of giant rabbit after transatlantic flight Simon, a 10-month-old giant rabbit, met a sad end after a transatlantic flight from London Heathrow to Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare airport in April. Although he was alive when the United Airlines plane landed in America, Simon was later found dead in his cage in a pet facility run by the airline. It was a tragedy for Simon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose owner said he had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as fit as a fiddle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on leaving London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and another PR disaster for United Airlines. Just three weeks earlier, a video showing a passenger being dragged off a United flight had sparked widespread outrage. 4. George Soros: Theresa May won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last and Trump is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwould-be dictator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 One of the highlights of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum in Davos was an attack on Donald Trump from octogenarian billionaire and philanthropist George Soros. At a plush dinner at the Swiss ski resort last January, the night before the presidential inauguration, Soros called Trump an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimposter and a con-man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who would trigger a trade war and try \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unsuccessfully \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to rule as a dictator. Soros also predicted that Theresa May wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long as UK prime minister and the inflation would drive down UK living standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so he certainly got one prediction right. 5. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top supplier of supermarket chicken fiddles food safety dates An investigation by the Guardian and ITV news revealed that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top supplier of chicken to supermarkets was tampering with food safety records. In undercover footage recorded at a 2 Sisters plant, workers were seen altering the slaughter date of poultry being processed, which may have duped customers into buying out-of-date meat. 6. Ryanair may face legal action over flight cancellations Ryanair was forced to cancel thousands of flights after a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mess-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in how it scheduled time off for its pilots. Chief executive Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary apologised to customers but the budget airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inept handling of the roster-related cancellations served to compound the outrage, as it was accused by the Civil Aviation Authority of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persistently misleading passengers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about their rights. By the end of the year, the airline would finally recognise pilot and cabin crew unions, marking dramatic shift after decades of refusing to negotiate with them. 7. Jamie Oliver to close six restaurants in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctough market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after Brexit vote In January, Jamie Oliver was left exposed by tough trading and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pressures and unknowns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following the Brexit vote, which saw him close six of his Jamie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian outlets. The six restaurants shuttered accounted for less than 5% of the restaurant chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total turnover and overall the chain was continuing to perform well both in the UK and abroad. 8. World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s witnessing a new Gilded Age as billionaires\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wealth swells to $6tn Not since the time of the Carnegies, Rockerfellers and Vanderbilts at the turn of the 20th century was so much owned by so few, as a new wealth report published in October revealed that billionaires had increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth, to a record $6tn. But the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-wealthy were, apparently, worried by this new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gilded Age\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. According to the the lead author of the UBS/PwC Billionaires report they feared the growing gap between rich and poor could lead to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strike back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 9. Chief economist of Bank of England admits errors in Brexit forecasting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair cop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, admitted the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane just a few days into the new year, as he accepted that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank had misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote. Economists had been brought into disrepute by a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash, and for predicting there would be a dramatic slowdown in the economy if the UK were to vote to leave the EU, he said. But while the Bank was wrong about the timing of a post-Brexit slump, Haldane insisted it would be proved right about the fundamentals. 10. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt timebomb: FCA urges action over \u00c2\u00a3200bn crisis Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing binge topped \u00c2\u00a3200bn, prompting a warning from the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial regulator that the government needed to step in to avert a debt crisis. Andrew Bailey told the Guardian that he was concerned about the sheer number of people who need loans to make ends meet, pinpointing gig economy workers as particularly vulnerable. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The use of government equity, or a loan, has already been discussed by Tokyo and London for one such plant, on the Welsh island of Anglesey. Horizon, the Japanese venture behind the project, is in talks with officials and has signalled it wants a decision on financing by mid-2018. And with a new boss at the helm of French state-owned EDF, which has ambitions to build a second plant, Horizon is unlikely to be the only nuclear builder testing the appetite for public finance. Adam Vaughan Global wealth gap to widen The gap between the super-rich and everyone else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is already at the widest it has been since the turn of the 20th century \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will continue to widen in 2018 as rich Americans benefit from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big, beautiful Christmas present\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax cuts. This month, the US president celebrated achieving Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the largest tax cut in our history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Corporation tax will be slashed from 35% to 21%, and the top tax rate cut from 39.6% to 37%. The Tax Policy Center calculates that 62% of the benefits of the tax changes would go to the richest 1% of Americans. The poorest Americans, who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t earn enough to benefit from the tax cuts, will benefit by about $60 a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 0.4% income boost. The top 0.1% can get their annual incomes to increase by about $190,000 on average \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or a 2.7% increase. The US is already the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most unequal society, with four out of five of the globe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people and 41 million officially in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. The World Inequality Report, produced by French economist Thomas Piketty, warned this month that unless there is globally coordinated political action to increase taxes on the super-wealthy, the richest-of-the-rich will continue to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more and more of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income at the expense of the poor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The global top 1% income share could increase from nearly 20% today to more than 24% by 2050,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the report said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In which case, the global bottom 50% share could fall from 10% to less than 9%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rupert Neate",
