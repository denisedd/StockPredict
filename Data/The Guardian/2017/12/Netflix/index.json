Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, credited the strength to improving corporate profitability, tweeting, \u201cWhy have global stocks gone up every month so far this year? Earnings have too (both actual and expected).\u201d And on that note, we really are finished for 2017. Best wishes for the new year, and goodnight! Hello again. After a rollicking year, the US stock market actually ended the final session of 2017 with some small losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to end 2017 at 24,719.22, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 index also dropped 0.5% to close the year at 2,673.61, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.7% to end at 6,903.39. But it was still a very good year for the Dow, which closed at record levels on 71 occasions - itself a record. Hello again. Here\u2019s our news story about the global stock market rally this year: I may pop back later with the Wall Street close, or any other major events. Either way, we wish you all the best for 2018. Happy New Year! GW Amazon\u2019s share price has taken a knock, though, after Donald Trump tweeted that it was getting an unfairly generous deal from the US post service. Here\u2019s the tweet in question: Ding ding! Over in New York, the final trading day of the year is underway. And stocks are moving a little higher - with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 30 points or 0.12%, and the S&amp;P 500 index up 0.16%. 2017 has been a bumper year for America\u2019s stock market, with the Dow surging by 25%m, and the tech-focused Nasdaq up by nearly a third. Technology stocks had a particularly amazing year -- Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all jumped by over 50%, and Apple was close behind. Gold has had its best year since 2010, pushed up by the weaker US dollar. It just hit $1,300 for the first time since mid-October. The FTSE 100 surged by around \u00a3141bn during 2017, according to the London stock exchange. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies, gained around \u00a352bn as it rattled to fresh record highs. That fed into the $9 trillion surge in global share prices during this year (as measured by MSCI) Shares have been a pretty decent investment this year - giving a rather better return than your local bank. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre (a retail stockbroker) says there are reasons why shares could keep rising in 2018. He says: \u201cFor the second year in a row the FTSE100 has ended the year at an all-time high. Personal investors will have been relieved this year by a respite from the high volatility seen in the last couple of years. The level of volatility this year has though been remarkably low by historical standards and this has perhaps meant fewer trading opportunities for those investors who trade more actively. Market commentators have expressed concerns about valuation levels for some time indicating a correction may be on the horizon. However, the market appears to be shrugging off any such concerns and continuing to go from strength to strength. Higher global growth forecasts, a continuation of relatively relaxed monetary policy and a loosening of fiscal policy specifically in the United States are all helping support equities. A personal investor who put money into a FTSE 100 tracker fund at the start of this year will have seen a return of nearly 8% with a dividend payout (yield) of over 3% on top of that. With base rates now at just 0.5% and returns on cash remaining depressed the stark choice for investors seeking to drive an income from their capital is clear and this too helps drive demand for equities and equity based collectives (funds). Mining giants also had a good year, thanks to a boom in commodity prices which saw copper hit a four-year high this week. So, which shares should you have bought a year ago, and which should have come with a health warning? The best-performing share on the FTSE 100 during 2017 was actually a healthcare business based in the the United Arab Emirates, called NMC Health. It jumped by 86% during the year; any traders who backed NMC may be sprinting to the nearest City champagne bar this afternoon.... Second was Worldpay, the payments processor company spun out of the wreckage of Royal Bank of Scotland. It jumped by 57%, thanks to a takeover bid from US rival Vantiv. Housebuilders also had a strong year; Persimmon was the third-best performing member of the Footsie, up 54%, followed by Berkeley Group which gained 49%. But some companies will be glad to see the back of 2017. Centrica slumped by over 40%, partly due to a big profits warning in November, while telecommunications group BT and advertising giant WPP both shank by around a quarter. Breaking! A late burst of buy orders have sent Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index up to a new all-time high. The final trading day of 2017 ended with a flourish, with the FTSE 100 closing up 64 points or 0.85% at 7,687 points. Just before the close, it hit a new intraday high of 7697 points. This means the blue-chip index has gained 7.6% during 2017. With the smaller FTSE 250 index also closing at a new record high, this puts the seal on a good year for the London stock market. But, this still means the Footsie has lagged behind other stock markets - with Japan\u2019s Topix and the US S&amp;P 500 both up around 20% during 2017. Just 10 minutes until the end of the trading year in London, and the FTSE 100 is heading towards a fresh closing high..... World stock markets have surged to a new alltime high today, meaning they\u2019ve put on a blistering $9 trillion in value since the start of January. That\u2019s according to Reuters, which reports: Markets were ending 2017 in a party mood on Friday after a year in which a concerted pick-up in global growth boosted corporate profits and commodity prices, while benign inflation kept central banks from snatching away the monetary punch bowl. MSCI\u2019s world equity index, which tracks 47 countries, inched up 0.15% as six straight weeks and now 13 straight months of gains left it at yet another all time high. The index has been on an upward trajectory for pretty much all of 2017, putting it 22 percent and almost $9 trillion higher for the year. Emerging markets have led the charge with gains of 34%. Hong Kong surged 36%, South Korea notched up 22% and India and Poland both made 27% in local currency terms. Japan\u2019s Nikkei and the S&amp;P 500 are both ahead by almost 20%, while the Dow has risen by a quarter. In Europe, the German DAX has gained nearly 14 %, though the UK FTSE has lagged a little with a rise of 7%. More here: Stocks cheer $9 trillion year, downer for the dollar The euro has enjoyed its best year since 2003, thanks to the recovery in the eurozone economy. The single currency is the best performing G10 currency, according to Bloomberg data: More photos of traders celebrating the last day of trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange in Manila have arrived; it seemed wrong not to share them. Traders have plenty to celebrate -- the main Philippine stock index hit an alltime high this morning, and has gained 25% this year. That helped Asian shares to rack up their best year since 2009 (as discussed earlier). The smaller FTSE 250 index is also at record levels. It rose by 0.25% to 20,695 points, a gain of 55 points this morning. The FTSE 100 is pushing further into record territory, as City investors get their buy orders in before trading closes early at 12.30pm. The blue-chip index has now hit a fresh record high of 7,648 points, up 25 points or 0.3% today. Reuters points out that natural resourse stocks had a stonking year: Miners have been among the FTSE\u2019s best-performing stocks this year, with Antofagasta up 47.4% and Glencore up 40.7% year-to-date. Elsewhere NMC Health has been the index\u2019s best-performing stock, while a takeover has pushed Worldpay\u2019s shares 57 percent higher this year. Housebuilders Persimmon and Berkeley Group have both had a comeback year, recovering after seeing their shares plummet in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum in June 2016. Technology companies have led the rally in Europe this year, mirroring the surge in Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook et al. Miners, banks and industrial companies also had a good year, as this chart shows: Like most financial assets, shares are generally held by richer people (either directly or through pension funds). So the surge in global stock markets this year won\u2019t have helped tackle wealth inequality. The FTSE 100\u2019s 6% rise this year has outpaced inflation (3.1% in December) and wages (up 2.3% during 2017). And the bad news for British workers is that pay growth is likely to lag behind all other wealthy nations in 2018. 2017 hasn\u2019t just been about rising stock markets. Brexit, Donald Trump, food safety, inequality and even a giant, sadly deceased, rabbit called Simon featured in our most popular stories this year. Here\u2019s a round-up of the business news that got you all clicking this year. The strong rally in Asia\u2019s stock markets this year is particularly remarkable, given the geopolitical threat posed by North Korea and the risk that president Trump could trigger a trade war. But instead, traders have shrugged off these worries - sending shares jumping across the region. As CNBC puts it: While geopolitical uncertainty was a major focal point earlier this year \u2014 with several North Korean missile launches initially sending investor scurrying into safe-have assets \u2014 risk appetite has since improved, with markets looking instead to stronger economic growth globally. MSCI\u2019s broad index of shares in Asia Pacific excluding Japan was up more than 34 percent year-to-date on Friday morning. That\u2019s above the roughly 25 percent climb seen on the Dow Jones industrial average and 8 percent rise on the pan-European STOXX 600 over the same period. The London stock market is \u201cdoing its festive best\u201d to reach the New Year at a fresh record high, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Here are the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100, as it hovers around this morning\u2019s peak of 7,636 points. Most global stock markets have enjoyed strong gains this year. Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, said of the 73 bourses it tracks globally, all but nine have recorded gains in local currency terms this year (that\u2019s via Reuters). Japan\u2019s Topix share index has also enjoyed a bumper year; it\u2019s risen by over 19% during 2017. Traders held a ceremony to mark the end of the trading year, and invited Go champion Yuta Iyama to ring the closing bell. European stock markets are on track to record their best year since 2013. The Stoxx 600 index has just opened flat, leaving it on track for a near-8% gain over the last 12 months. The pound is also having a good morning. It\u2019s up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.35, a three-week high. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new record at the start of trading. The blue-chip index has jumped by 13 points to 7,636, slightly over yesterday\u2019s record high. It means the Footsie has risen by 4.5% during December - a month that saw Britain agree the first phase of a Brexit deal with Brussels. Just Eat, the fast food-ordering app company, is leading the risers, up 1.8%. It only joined the FTSE 100 this month, after seeing its value overtake the likes of supermarket chain J Sainsbury. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the final day of the trading year, and what a year it\u2019s been for investors. Stocks have surged world wide over the last 12 months - thanks to renewed confidence in the global economy and a steady drip-drip-drip of monetary stimulus from central bankers. Over in Asia, the markets have enjoyed their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which tracks stocks across the region, has surged by almost 29% this year. Hong Kong has enjoyed a particularly exuberant year - jumping by an sparkling 36%, while South Korea posted a 22% gain and India jumped by 27%. Ceremonies have already been taking place at stock markets across Asia, including in Tokyo and Manila. Many commodities have strengthened this year too, at the expense of the weaker US dollar. Donald Trump\u2019s push for tax cuts has not made the greenback great again. In Europe, many stock markets are already sitting on double-digit gains - Germany\u2019s DAX, for example, is up 13%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit fresh record highs this week, but has actually only gained around 6.7% during the year. Today\u2019s trading session will end at 12.30pm. So, a solid year for shares. But could the markets be peaking? Some investors worry that the good times could end soon. For example, an index from State Street that tracks investor risk appetite suffered its six straight monthly fall in December. As Michael Metcalfe, State Street\u2019s head of global macro strategy, put it: \u201cWhile the broader economic outlook appears increasingly rosy, as captured by measures of consumer and business confidence, the more cautious nature of investors hints at a concern that markets may have already discounted much of the good news.\u201d There\u2019s not much in the agenda (understandably), apart from new inflation figures from Germany.",

                "bodyText":"The consensus view among economists is that the global economy will put in a strong performance in 2018, carrying on its strong momentum from 2017. However, that does not mean that every sector and every company will have a trouble-free year. Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary will need to repair staff relations, jobs will leave the City of London and inequality will widen. Our financial and economic specialists predict the big stories in 2018. A good year overall \u2026 The global economy is set fair in 2018. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently upgraded its forecast for global growth to 3.7%, to reflect the return to health of manufacturing in most of the developed world and China. Manufacturing growth was at a standstill in 2014, as China stemmed the flow of unprofitable cheap exports and the eurozone wrestled with the Greek debt crisis. This year has proved more buoyant. A dramatic rise in global trade pushed factories across the world to their highest output for decades during November. It is a trend that forecasters expect to continue into 2018. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which were pushed through Congress at breakneck speed, are another shot in the arm \u2013 even if the only effect is to raise business and consumer confidence levels over the next year. Oil prices have risen sharply to more than $60 a barrel from a low point below $40 last year, but analysts expect further rises to be muted, allowing growth to continue without an increase in fuel costs putting on the brake. The IMF highlighted Brexit as a possible drag on the prospects for growth, along with high levels of global debt. But with stock markets hitting new highs at the end of the year, the picture remains quite rosy. Phillip Inman \u2026 but shares might ease off After a year of booming stock markets around the globe, commentators are virtually unanimous in predicting that returns in 2018 won\u2019t match those of 2017. The S&amp;P 500 surged 20% this year to a new record high, the Dax index in Germany jumped 13% and, in Paris, the market was up 10%. The FTSE 100 has also reached record territory, moving above the 7,600 level for the first time just before Christmas. But its year-on-year gain is only 7%, reflecting widespread concerns over Brexit, the economy and feeble wage growth. It remains only a few per cent above its previous high of nearly 7,000 in the final days of the tech boom of 1999-00. Wall Street, by contrast, has risen 75% since then. Could 2018 be the year the FTSE\u2019s relative underperformance improves? If Brexit negotiations go more smoothly than predicted, interest rates remain low and wages pick up, then domestically focused UK stocks could be the surprise winners (with foreign buyers taking advantage of sterling\u2019s weakness). How to play it? After his annus horribilis, fading star fund manager Neil Woodford could see his fortunes recover \u2013 but he\u2019s still very concerned about overvalued markets globally. Patrick Collinson Netflix and Amazon on the up By the end of next year, services such as Netflix and Amazon will have become as popular with British TV viewers as \u201ctraditional\u201d pay-TV companies such as Sky and BT. The number of pay-TV customers signed up to the main UK providers \u2013 Sky, Virgin Media, BT and TalkTalk \u2013 is expected to reach almost 16.8 million by the end of next year. By then, the number of people paying for subscription video-on-demand services (SVOD) \u2013 Netflix and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video being by far the most popular \u2013 is forecast to hit about 16.7 million. When the margin for error in the forecasts is factored in it is possible that SVOD services, which include Sky\u2019s Now TV and smaller fare such as family-focused DisneyLife, could prove even more popular than pay-TV. \u201cIn a few short years, Brits have flocked to these new streaming services, which have become a household staple,\u201d says Richard Broughton of Ampere Analysis. \u201cThe UK is one of a handful of markets around the world leading the charge, embracing online viewing.\u201d However, Sky and friends won\u2019t be fearing for the future of their business models just yet. Largely, consumers are taking services like Netflix alongside pay-TV packages from businesses like Sky, with only 29% saying they choose SVOD specifically over pay-TV. Mark Sweney City jobs on the move Next year is key for the City and banking. Brexit-related job moves are expected as banks begin to implement plans to keep doing business once the UK leaves the EU. The speed and scale of the Brexit moves \u2013 which, says the Bank of England, could affect 10,000 jobs by \u201cday one\u201d in March 2019 \u2013 will depend on whether a transition period can be agreed and what sort of trading arrangements are made after Brexit. Many regard Goldman Sachs as a barometer: its new \u00a3350m European headquarters in London is due for completion in March 2019. Decisions about how many of the 10 storeys it will fill could be taken in 2018 \u2013 signalled, perhaps, though Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s active Twitter feed. The Goldman boss taunted the City last year by praising Frankfurt and Paris \u2013 the bank\u2019s preferred post-Brexit hubs. More institutions will follow. Jill Treanor Ryanair still battling with staff The no-frills airline has already moved to placate disgruntled pilots, at least for the time being, by agreeing to discuss union recognition. It has now promised to sit down with cabin crew, who will have been emboldened by the pilots\u2019 success in holding chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s feet to the fire. After decades of refusing to recognise unions, it seems unlikely that Ryanair will yield easily to the every demand of either pilots or cabin crew. Should major points of disagreement arise, that could scupper any chance of a swift rapprochement that allows Ryanair to focus on what it does best: flogging more airline tickets than anyone else in Europe. After the embarrassment of two successive waves of flight cancellations in winter 2017, Ryanair will be desperate to stick to its knitting now. That gives cabin crew and pilots more bargaining power than ever before. Rob Davies Nuclear sector in cash struggle The new year will see the backers of new UK nuclear power stations scrabbling for ways to raise the finance for their enormous upfront costs. The first new plant to start construction in more than two decades, Hinkley Point C, loaded all the upfront cost and risk with the developer, EDF. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that a new financing model will be needed if the government is to get the new nuclear energy it wants. The use of government equity, or a loan, has already been discussed by Tokyo and London for one such plant, on the Welsh island of Anglesey. Horizon, the Japanese venture behind the project, is in talks with officials and has signalled it wants a decision on financing by mid-2018. And with a new boss at the helm of French state-owned EDF, which has ambitions to build a second plant, Horizon is unlikely to be the only nuclear builder testing the appetite for public finance. Adam Vaughan Global wealth gap to widen The gap between the super-rich and everyone else \u2013 which is already at the widest it has been since the turn of the 20th century \u2013 will continue to widen in 2018 as rich Americans benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful Christmas present\u201d tax cuts. This month, the US president celebrated achieving Congress\u2019s approval for \u201cthe largest tax cut in our history\u201d. Corporation tax will be slashed from 35% to 21%, and the top tax rate cut from 39.6% to 37%. The Tax Policy Center calculates that 62% of the benefits of the tax changes would go to the richest 1% of Americans. The poorest Americans, who don\u2019t earn enough to benefit from the tax cuts, will benefit by about $60 a year \u2013 a 0.4% income boost. The top 0.1% can get their annual incomes to increase by about $190,000 on average \u2013 or a 2.7% increase. The US is already the world\u2019s most unequal society, with four out of five of the globe\u2019s richest people and 41 million officially in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. The World Inequality Report, produced by French economist Thomas Piketty, warned this month that unless there is globally coordinated political action to increase taxes on the super-wealthy, the richest-of-the-rich will continue to \u201ccapture\u201d more and more of the world\u2019s income at the expense of the poor. \u201cThe global top 1% income share could increase from nearly 20% today to more than 24% by 2050,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn which case, the global bottom 50% share could fall from 10% to less than 9%.\u201d Rupert Neate",
