Oxfam found that US corporations reported $80bn (\u00a364bn) in profits in Bermuda in 2012 \u2013 more than their combined reported profits in Japan, China, Germany and France. \u201cPeople are pressuring overseas territories because they feel we are defenceless, in some way easy pickings,\u201d said Richards. \u201cThey are moving the goalposts on us almost every three weeks.\u201d The Bermudian premier, Michael Dunkley, has joined Richards in London this week for a series of briefings with UK ministers, with Brexit top of the agenda. Richards said his government was in listening mode but, if pushed, it would not hesitate to protect its interests. He said last year he \u201cwould not hesitate to go for independence\u201d if his country were threatened by Brexit. Bermuda\u2019s last push for independence was in a 1995 referendum. Richards said: \u201cAt the moment our interests are aligned but if that changes then we will have to think of ourselves. We must protect Bermuda\u2019s interests. This amendment being proposed [by Hodge] is not in the interests of Bermuda.\u201d",

Grant Shapps claimed that Javid was wrong to put a positive glow on the shake up of business rates.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Sajid needs to do is take control of his officials who are urging him to claim that most businesses will see lower bills,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that this revaluation raises an extra \u00a31bn in tax and that is why this is hurting. </p> <p>\u201cBeing completely upfront about this would be far better than sending out a letter in a Trumpesque-tone blaming the media for higher business rates.\u201d</p> <p>There was sympathy among colleagues for the communities secretary, with some pointing out that he had faced most flack despite it being the Treasury that was in charge of setting business rates. One MP said Hammond now appeared to be \u201criding into the rescue\u201d. Another added: \u201cThe gossip in tea room is the fact that Sajid is being hung out to dry but it is not his fault.\u201d</p> <p>A number of MPs have written to the chancellor and to Javid urging immediate action. Ben Howlett questioned the \u201cincreasingly London-centric nature of economic policy\u201d, claiming some companies in his Bath constituency faced a 12.5% increase in the tax.<br></p> <p>Anna Soubry revealed that when she was business minister she had urged colleagues to reform the charge or even scrap it completely and raise the money via other means. </p> <p>\u201cBusiness rates are not fair because you have to pay them whether you are making money or not, and they don\u2019t represent your [profit], just what building you are in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could be running a multimillion pound business from relatively small building but pay the same as a shop of the same size employing three people with hugely smaller turnover.\u201d</p> <p>Despite sources strongly suggesting that the government could take action to reduce anger on the party\u2019s backbenches, the Conservative minister Marcus Jones told MPs there was no need for a review because one was carried out in 2015. </p> <p>\u201cThe clear view then, including from the business community, was that they wanted to retain the current system,\u201d he said, during a debate about the local government bill.</p> <p>The Labour and co-op MP Gareth Thomas, who was pushing the minister on the issue, said it was \u201chugely disappointing\u201d that the government rejected calls for a review and accused ministers of having a \u201ctin ear\u201d when it came to concerns. He called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/11/nhs-hospitals-in-england-face-322m-tax-bill-increase-from-april\">business rate relief for both schools and hospitals</a> warning they were already under \u201csevere financial pressure\u201d. </p> <p>His colleague, Bill Esterson, the shadow business minister, called for a \u201ccomprehensive overhaul\u201d of the entire system.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are also attacking the government over the controversy, and have picked out individual companies badly hit including the restaurant featured in the hit television programme, First Dates, which will face a 37% increase in rates \u2013 equivalent to almost \u00a327,000. The iconic nightclub, Fabric, will see its bill rise by slightly more than that.</p> <p>Companies want to see the impact of the revaluation limited but also a change in the rules so that decisions to invest in the property \u2013 for example with new machinery \u2013 are not linked to a further rise in business rates.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was \u201czapping productivity\u201d. \u201cOne of the best things that could be done is to eliminate that perverse incentive,\u201d he said, adding that ministers should also use the budget to \u201cblunt the impact of the revaluation\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile the decision by government to release data about Conservative constituencies to MPs has angered Labour politicians.

Javid\u2019s intervention will follow the Hammond, who told Tory MPs on Monday night that he is in \u201clistening mode\u201d. In the longer term, ministers are likely to attempt to end a loophole that means highly profitable internet companies, such as Amazon, will benefit from cuts while small independent businesses are badly hit. One senior MP accused Javid and Gauke of adopting the attacking language of US president Donald Trump in their attempt to quell the backlash. Grant Shapps claimed that Javid was wrong to put a positive glow on the shake up of business rates. \u201cWhat Sajid needs to do is take control of his officials who are urging him to claim that most businesses will see lower bills,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that this revaluation raises an extra \u00a31bn in tax and that is why this is hurting. \u201cBeing completely upfront about this would be far better than sending out a letter in a Trumpesque-tone blaming the media for higher business rates.\u201d There was sympathy among colleagues for the communities secretary, with some pointing out that he had faced most flack despite it being the Treasury that was in charge of setting business rates. One MP said Hammond now appeared to be \u201criding into the rescue\u201d. Another added: \u201cThe gossip in tea room is the fact that Sajid is being hung out to dry but it is not his fault.\u201d A number of MPs have written to the chancellor and to Javid urging immediate action. Ben Howlett questioned the \u201cincreasingly London-centric nature of economic policy\u201d, claiming some companies in his Bath constituency faced a 12.5% increase in the tax. Anna Soubry revealed that when she was business minister she had urged colleagues to reform the charge or even scrap it completely and raise the money via other means. \u201cBusiness rates are not fair because you have to pay them whether you are making money or not, and they don\u2019t represent your [profit], just what building you are in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could be running a multimillion pound business from relatively small building but pay the same as a shop of the same size employing three people with hugely smaller turnover.\u201d Despite sources strongly suggesting that the government could take action to reduce anger on the party\u2019s backbenches, the Conservative minister Marcus Jones told MPs there was no need for a review because one was carried out in 2015. \u201cThe clear view then, including from the business community, was that they wanted to retain the current system,\u201d he said, during a debate about the local government bill. The Labour and co-op MP Gareth Thomas, who was pushing the minister on the issue, said it was \u201chugely disappointing\u201d that the government rejected calls for a review and accused ministers of having a \u201ctin ear\u201d when it came to concerns. He called for business rate relief for both schools and hospitals warning they were already under \u201csevere financial pressure\u201d. His colleague, Bill Esterson, the shadow business minister, called for a \u201ccomprehensive overhaul\u201d of the entire system. The Liberal Democrats are also attacking the government over the controversy, and have picked out individual companies badly hit including the restaurant featured in the hit television programme, First Dates, which will face a 37% increase in rates \u2013 equivalent to almost \u00a327,000. The iconic nightclub, Fabric, will see its bill rise by slightly more than that. Companies want to see the impact of the revaluation limited but also a change in the rules so that decisions to invest in the property \u2013 for example with new machinery \u2013 are not linked to a further rise in business rates. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was \u201czapping productivity\u201d. \u201cOne of the best things that could be done is to eliminate that perverse incentive,\u201d he said, adding that ministers should also use the budget to \u201cblunt the impact of the revaluation\u201d. Meanwhile the decision by government to release data about Conservative constituencies to MPs has angered Labour politicians. Seema Malhotra has written to Hammond to say she believes it was an abuse of official data and has written to the UK Statistics Authority about it. Counting the cost Bryars and Bryars, Cecil Court, London Tim Bryars, who runs an antique book store near Covent Garden, is facing a 20% increase in his rates bill in the coming two years. \u201cI\u2019ve got to sell quite a lot of books to clear the extra profit required to cover that 20% increase,\u201d said Bryars. \u201cIf the market goes online I think something will be lost \u2026 you can only Google something if you\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d Bryars is particularly irked by the way the revaluation process has benefited online stores at the expense of the high street. \u201cPeople see independent stores closing and think those businesses couldn\u2019t cut it in the modern world because of the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut lots of small businesses are perfectly viable; they just can\u2019t find half their rent again in business rates before all the other expenses. The business rates system probably worked fine in the late 20th century but it is out of date if multinationals like Amazon see their rates bill fall while small independent retailers see theirs rise.\u201d Titanic Brewery, Stoke, Staffordshire Keith Bott and his brother Dave run Titanic Brewery, a small business that owns and operates eight pubs in Staffordshire, and Bott said the increase in rates will cost the business \u201ctens of thousands of pounds\u201d, once a transitional relief period ends in five years. He said the main problem was that rates on pubs were linked to their turnover not property value. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 25% increase in rateable values across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to recognise and understand the issue. Pubs are responsible for 0.5% of turnover of the UK economy but pay 2.8% of business rates.\u201d Rob Davies and Zoe Wood",
