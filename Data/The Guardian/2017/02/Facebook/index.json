Neil Campling, head of global technology research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, told CNBC: \u201cSnapchat is likely on a faster growth path than either Google or Facebook. Their opportunity is enormous and just beginning.\u201d Snapchat has tried to differentiate itself from Facebook by not allowing adverts targeted directly at users\u2019 interests or browsing history. \u201cI got an ad this morning for something I was thinking about buying yesterday, and it\u2019s really annoying. We care about not being creepy,\u201d Spiegel said in 2015. Facebook\u2019s advertising is sold entirely by computer program. Advertisers can visit ads.facebook.com, plug in payment information and create an advert. Those ads can be targeted as narrowly or broadly as the advertiser desires, and can be billed in a variety of ways, from paying a flat fee for every thousand views to payments per click, per like and more. Where are they based? Facebook\u2019s huge headquarters in Silicon Valley\u2019s Menlo Park has a \u201cgreen roof\u201d the size of seven American football pitches. The company employs more than 17,000 people across the world. It is hiring an extra 500 workers in the UK in advance of the opening of a new HQ in London\u2019s Fitzrovia, where it will have 1,500 full-time staff when it opens. Snap has headquarters on Venice Beach, Los Angeles, where it has been based since it started in Spiegel\u2019s dad\u2019s house. From there, it has slowly eaten up available properties on Venice Beach, turning beachfront condos into offices and restaurants into cafeterias to service its growing army of staff. Last month Snap announced plans to set up its international \u201chub\u201d in the UK. The UK office, which has grown from six to 75 staff in the last year, will not only be the taxable base for Snap\u2019s British revenue, but also for all revenue made in third countries which do not (yet) have their own local establishment.",

                "bodyText":"Bovis Homes is to pay \u00a37m to repair poorly built new homes sold to customers, raising fresh questions about the standards of new-build properties across the country and the regulation of the market. The company \u2013 one of the biggest housebuilders builders in Britain \u2013 will pay compensation after angry customers formed a Facebook group accusing Bovis of pressuring them to move in to incomplete houses so it could hit sales targets. The boss of Bovis apologised to customers on Monday for the poor quality of their houses and promised to finish them \u201cto their satisfaction\u201d. He refused to state how many homes needed the urgent repair work, or how much it will cost to fix each house. The company also refused to say which developments were worst affected, but it is understood that many of the problem homes are in Kent. The announcement led to more than \u00a3100m being wiped off the stock market value of Bovis, with its shares falling 10% to 757p. The news comes amid growing complaints about the quality of new homes and the organisation that sets the standards for new-build properties. Critics claim NHBC , which provides 10-year warranties for most new homes in Britain, is failing to protect consumers. Another recent controversy over new homes has seen Britain\u2019s largest housing association, Clarion Housing Group, agree to buy back some properties on a housing development in the east London borough of Havering. Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on new builds, called for an independent ombudsman to hold housebuilders to account. \u201cA lot of developments across the country are not very good, and I\u2019m concerned about all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a genuine need for more housing but we need to ensure they are going to be good quality housing rather than the sometimes frankly rubbish. \u201cBuying a house is the biggest financial investment families are going to make. It is their dream and suddenly they find out it is not fit for purpose.\u201d Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance campaign group, said buying a new homes is \u201criskier than buying a home that has been standing for 100 years\u201d. She added: \u201cPeople are going in with their eyes shut because they think they are getting the same protection as other big purchases. There need to be alot more consumer protection. \u201c[The Bovis homes] were signed off for the needs of the shareholder, not for the needs of the homeowner.\u201d Earl Sibley, Bovis\u2019s interim chief executive, announced the \u00a37m \u201ccustomer care provision\u201d as homeowners prepare to protest at the company\u2019s annual meeting in May. Sibley, who stepped in after Dave Ritchie quit after a profits warning last month, said he would make fixing customers homes the \u201cabsolute operational priority\u201d. He said the company had experienced a much higher number of \u201csnagging issues\u201d on new homes than it would normally expect and had conducted a \u201cthorough and detailed review\u201d. He admitted that the company\u2019s customer service \u201cfell materially short\u201d and had been \u201cdeclining for some time\u201d.
