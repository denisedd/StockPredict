The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of input price inflation rose to the highest since CIPS began collecting responses in 1992. Firms attributed this to the weak pound and rising commodity prices.

Factory output growth accelerated to a 32-month high in January, as solid domestic demand continued to drive production volumes higher. There were signs that the boost to export orders from the weak exchange rate was waning, as growth of new business from abroad slowed sharply. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big numbers coming out of the January survey were for the price measures. Input cost inflation spiked to the highest seen since data were first collected in 1992. Over 55% of companies link rising costs to the exchange rate. However, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also seeing more companies reporting domestic supplier price hikes resulting from the rising cost of commodities such as fuel, oil, plastics and steel. With cost pressures increasingly feeding though to higher selling prices at factories, it looks inevitable that consumer price inflation will rise further in coming months. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The question is whether increased cost inflationary pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward. Companies seem fairly sanguine on this front, as a new index tracking business confidence signals optimism climbed to an eight- month high. Taken alongside robust output growth, rising new order inflows and job creation, all signs are pointing to a solid contribution to UK GDP from manufacturing during the opening quarter of 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-01T11:01:17.619Z\">at 11.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5891a8f1e4b0e481c6e4979a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-01T09:26:54.900Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greek factories struggled in January due to particularly wintery weather, Markit reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greek manufacturers felt the effects of unexpected heavy snowfall in the opening month of the new year, with the health of the sector deteriorating at the sharpest pace since September 2015.</p> <p>The downturn was driven by marked declines in both output and new orders, subsequently leading firms to reduce their headcounts further.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Wall Street has closed a little higher tonight. Shares were helped by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat view of the US economy, and its decision not to hike borrowing costs. The blowout ADP jobs figures, released earlier today, also boosted the mood among traders. The strong manufacturing data from January provided another lift. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Goodnight! GW There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much market reaction to the Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average has turned positive. up a modest 24 points at 19,888 points. Wall Street traders are encouraged that the Fed had an upbeat view of the US economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic statement with regard to inflation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas (via Reuters) The next US interest rate hike might not come until June, argues Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets. The market is currently attaching around a 25 percent probability to a hike in March and that is unlikely to change substantially following the broadly neutral statement. Although recent Fed commenters have taken a more hawkish tone it seems that the uncertainty surrounding likely policy moves in the coming months means that the FOMC remains in wait and see mode. While a March move is still possible should headline inflation and inflation expectations rise materially in the coming weeks, it seems that the June meeting is now the most likely time for the next hike in the cycle. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics agrees, saying the Fed is obviously in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwait and see mode\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. At the conclusion of its two-day FOMC meeting, the Fed issued a near-identical statement to the one released in December, which strongly suggests it has no intention of raising interest rates again at the upcoming March meeting. We love a sporting metaphor in this blog, but Matt Weller, Senior Market Analyst at Faraday Research, may baffle UK readers with this quote.... Ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, some analysts were comparing the central banker confab to this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFL Pro Bowl, an event that even diehard football fans struggled to watch given the lack of effort by the so-called stars. As it turns out, watching a replay of the Pro Bowl (or even watching paint dry) may have been more exciting. The Fed will be reluctant to raise borrowing costs until it has a better idea of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy plans, argues Tanweer Akram of Thrivent Financial, a financial services group. Akram says: Higher tariffs, restrictive immigration policies, and protectionism could have some harmful effects, though increased infrastructure spending and lower taxes could be beneficially. It remains to be seen what economic policies will enacted and how these will be implemented. Tighter labor markets could lead to an increase in inflation, but so far inflationary pressures have been restrained. The Fed will resume tighten in the coming months if economic conditions continue to show signs of improvement and there is evidence of inflationary pressures mounting. Kully Samra, UK Managing Director of Charles Schwab, says the Fed was in no rush to hike borrowing costs today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is only the first FOMC meeting of eight in 2017 so there are still plenty of opportunities for the Fed to raise interest rates throughout the year and it is likely that we will see a rate rise in March or June. In our view, two rate hikes this year would be sufficient to stave off inflation concerns and would not negatively impact economic growth. Samra argues that the US stock market will keep rallying in the months ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is picking up and the Fed is becoming more hawkish, but the conditions supporting those moves can also be seen as positive news for US stocks. We continue to see encouraging economic data and earnings reports which, combined with a healthy job market, wage growth and increased consumer confidence, is good news for US equities and the wider economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We stand by our view that U.S. stocks will outperform developed international stocks in the coming months. Although rising inflation and investor nerves could lead to bouts of volatility and some pullbacks, the bull market shows little sign of slowing in the near future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprised that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged today -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only two months since their last hike, after all. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: The US Federal Reserve has flagged up that the US economy is strengthening (but not enough to encourage it to raise borrowing costs today). In a statement, it says: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained soft. On inflation, the Fed says that the cost of living has picked up, but remains below its target of 2% in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers also see economic growth continuing, even as it tightens monetary policy in the months ahead. They say: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has decided to leave interest rates unchanged, at their current level of 0.5%-0.75%. European stock markets closed higher tonight, helped by the news that factory output across the eurozone rose last month. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC gained 0.96%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX ended 1.1% higher. In London, though, the FTSE 100 lost its early gains to finish just 8 points higher, or +0.1%. It was dragged back by a strengthening pound. Sterling gained 1% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.175, and 0.5% against the US dollar to $1.264. Some traders are wondering if the Bank of England will hint at raising interest rates soon, at its quarterly inflation report tomorrow. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank says: With some words of Brexit-related caution, the Bank of England (BoE) may surprise with a more hawkish tone at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Report as it revises up its near-term growth forecast and highlights growing underlying inflationary risks. The shift could come either in the form of more hawkish forward guidance or some MPC members voting in favour of bringing an end to the planned corporate bond purchase program sooner than planned. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in a few hours to catch the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision (at 7pm GMT, or 2pm East Coast time). In the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brisk summary. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sectors made a decent start to 2017, according to a flurry of manufacturing surveys from across the globe. The data show that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories kept growing, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picked up too, while the eurozone enjoyed its strongest month in almost seven years. France, Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands all did well. In the UK, too, factories recorded strong increases in output. But that was overshadowed by a huge leap in the cost of raw materials, partly due to the weak pound. Economists warned that firms will pass these costs onto consumers, driving British inflation higher. Figures just released from the US painted a similar pattern of solid growth, and rising input prices. Elsewhere today... A leaked report has shown that Brussels is worried that Europe will suffer if the City is hurt by Brexit. UK house price inflation has slowed again: And supermarket chain founder Sir Ken Morrison has died. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of his best quotes: ISM has just released its rival survey of US manufacturing -- and it also shows growth picking up last month. Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has grown at the fastest pace in almost two years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report on the US factory sector. Its US manufacturing PMI has jumped to 55.0 in January, up from 54.3 in December, showing stronger growth. Firms reported that output and new business orders rose last month, while input price pressures also increased (something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen in Europe and the UK today) Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says the US manufacturing sector has started 2017 with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite exports being subdued by the strong dollar, order books are growing at the fastest pace for over two years on the back of improved domestic demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With optimism about the year ahead at the highest since last March, the outlook has also brightened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production is consequently growing at the strongest rate for almost two years and inventories are rising at a rate not seen for nearly a decade as firms respond to higher demand, suggesting the goods-producing sector will make a decent contribution to first quarter GDP. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With input costs also rising at the steepest rate for over two years, and hiring sustained at an encouragingly solid pace as firms expand capacity, all of the survey indicators point to the Fed hiking interest rates again soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are continuing to rally today, as traders welcome this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong factory data. The Stoxx 600 index is up 1.3%, on track for its biggest one-day gain since 9th November (the date of the US election) Over in Greece....there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a breakthrough in the stalled review of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout. Helena Smith reports: Mounting signs of friction between Greece and foreign lenders show no sign of abate this morning with MPs in the ruling Syriza party saying there is no way they will bow to demands to implement more austerity once the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout ends in mid 2018. Signalling the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve to stick to its guns, the leading Syriza MP Sia Agnastopoulou ruled out signing up to further cost-cutting reforms beyond those Athens has already committed to saying to do so would be totally undemocratic. Europe, she said, would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undermining itself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and its values if it continued to demand the prior legislation of measures that will take effect in 2019 - the single biggest obstacle to completing a bailout review on which further rescue funds now depend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit is not on our agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the former alternate minister for European affairs told Skai TV brushing off renewed speculation of euro exit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is on the agenda of those who want the break-up of Europe and that is what [the German finance minister] Mr Schauble wants. We want to close this negotiation without prior legislation of measures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added, arguing that further measures would be catastrophic for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Europe will be undermining itself, undermining democracy, if it insists.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prime minister Alexis Tsipras is facing mounting pressure from his own MPs not to sign up to additional austerity amid growing signs of a mutiny if it does. Interior Minister Panos Skourletis, a senior figure in Syriza, has repeatedly said there have to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limits to negotiations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after seven years of austerity-driven recession and poverty. Greece faces major debt repayments in July which has once again reignited fears of the country being at the forefront of another euro zone crisis this summer. Breaking! American companies created tens of thousands more jobs than expected last month. The latest ADP survey of US company payrolls has absolutely smashed forecasts, showing an increase of 246,000 workers last month. Economists had expected an increase of 165,000. This suggests that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll (the principle US jobs report) could also be pretty strong. Traders are pushing the dollar higher: Our Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey, has a great story -- a leaked report has shown that the EU is worried that a poor Brexit deal could hurt the City of London, and rebound badly on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. He writes: The European commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiators must strike a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153workable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to protect the City of London or the economies of the remaining member states will be damaged, a leaked EU report warns. The document \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has been seen by the Guardian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c describes it as critical for the economic health of the remaining member states that the current financial eco-system is not hit in the coming Brexit negotiations. The paper, drawn up by officials working for the European parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful committee on economic and monetary affairs (Econ), warns that UK-based financial services account for 40% of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets under management and 60% of its capital markets business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And UK-based banks provide more than \u00c2\u00a31.1tn of loans to the other EU member states,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Econ secretariat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paper notes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If financial services companies choose to leave the UK as a result of Brexit, the consequences should be carefully evaluated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A badly designed final deal would damage both the UK and the other 27 EU member states. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The exclusion of the main European financial centre from the internal market could have consequences in terms of jobs and growth in the EU. It is in the interest of EU 27 and the UK to have an open discussion on this point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full tale: Morrisons have issued a statement to the City, confirming that Sir Ken Morrison has died, and explaining his major contribution to the company over more than 50 years: Sir Ken Morrison CBE The company has been informed by the Morrison family of the very sad news of the passing of Life President, and former Chairman, Sir Ken Morrison CBE. Sir Ken was an inspirational retailer who led Morrisons for more than half a century, transforming the company from a small family business into the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth largest food retailer.At his retirement in 2008, Morrisons had 375 stores, serving over nine million customers a week. Sir Ken will be greatly missed by many thousands of his current and former colleagues, a large number of whom became close personal friends over the years. Sir Ken was Morrisons Chairman until 2008. He was awarded the CBE in 1990 and knighted in the Millennium New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Honours list for his services to the food retailing industry. Widely considered one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest retailers, Sir Ken developed the culture, values and clear direction for the business which remain the bedrock of the firm today. His legacy includes many enduring innovations, such as Market Street and Morrisons unique vertical integration model. Andrew Higginson, the current Chairman of Morrisons, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know that I speak for the whole company when I say how profoundly sad we were to hear of Sir Ken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. He was an inspirational leader and the driving force behind Morrisons for over half a century. Although he retired several years ago, his legacy is evident every day and in every aspect of our business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking Morrisons from a small Bradford-based family business to a major UK grocery retailing chain is an outstanding achievement in the history of UK business. On a personal level, Ken was an enormous help to me as we made some significant changes to set the business on a new course; his knowledge of retail and his strategic insights have remained as relevant and intuitive as they were when he first built the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ken will be remembered by us all for his leadership, his passion for retailing and for his great love of Morrisons. To honour his memory in the most appropriate way we can, we will continue to develop the company that he built and loved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will miss his friendship and his wise counsel very deeply, and our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sir Ken Morrison, one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful businessmen, has died at the age of 85. Sir Ken took over his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s egg-and-butter grocery business in Bradford in the 1950s, and grew the company into one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest supermarket chains on the back of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no nonsense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd low-price offerings. More than a decade ago, we wrote: Sir Ken is regarded as a grandee of the British grocery business. Even at 71, he still walks the shop floors and is regarded as a hard task master by his 43,000 employees. He is fiercely protective of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s northern heritage and his forays south are few and far between. When he does venture to the capital he ensconces himself in the foyer of a hotel and grants audiences to those who wish to see him. But former Asda chief executive Allan Leighton described him as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153streets ahead of everybody in terms of retailing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2004, Wm Morrison swooped on southern rival Safeway in a \u00c2\u00a33.3bn deal, after decades of steady profit growth. That deal had its problems, leading to profit warnings and boardroom rows -- but Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turned it around, and Sir Ken was the longest-serving chairman of a blue chip company when he stepped down to become Life President in 2008. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early tributes: There are also signs today that the UK housing market is running out of steam, as economic uncertainty and rising inflation hit confidence. Nationwide, the building society, reported earlier this morning that annual house price inflation slowed to 4.3% in January, from 4.5% in December. Chief economist Robert Gardner warns that the housing market outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains clouded, especially as earnings growth is slowing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation set to rise further in the months ahead as a result of the weaker pound, real wages are likely to come under further pressure. Employment growth is also likely to continue to moderate, should the economy slow as most forecasters expect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that this will be a tough year for UK manufacturers:, even though output was strong in January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The makers appear to have begun 2017 on a similarly strong note as they ended 2016. Granted, January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI dipped slightly to 55.9 from the 56.1 seen in the previous month. But this was well above both the average of 52.4 recorded in 2016 and even further above the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-run norm of 51.5. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of the details of January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey were also reassuring. Output rose at the fastest rate since May 2014 and new orders and employment were also up. The domestic market accounted for the bulk of growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while export orders continued to rise, the pace of expansion saw a noticeable slowdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there were some ominous developments amongst signs of a sector in good fettle. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of input price inflation rose to the highest since CIPS began collecting responses in 1992. Firms attributed this to the weak pound and rising commodity prices. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in output prices was also close to a record. The acceleration in consumer price inflation presaged by these moves suggests that manufacturers will face an increasingly tough year as 2017 progresses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, also believes consumers are going to be hit in the pocket by this jump in raw material costs. With mounting evidence of pricing pressures across the industrial sector, the pass through to consumers is certainly on its way. This does present some risks to the resilience of the UK market later this year, in addition to the risks from further sharp swings in exchange rates and a shift in gears in global growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How worried should consumers be about this record jump in factory input costs? Capital Economics reckon that firms are managing to absorb some of the impact, rather than simply passing everything on through higher prices in the shops: But David Noble, Group CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says people will be worried: Input costs rose at their fastest rate in 25 years and higher commodity prices made an impact on margins along with the weaker pound. With these ongoing cost burdens, manufacturers were no longer able to absorb these costs themselves as output prices grew at one of the fastest rates since records began. Consumers must soon be wondering whether these rising costs will impact on their daily life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, is encouraged that UK factory growth hit a 32-month high last month, despite the pressure from surging raw materials costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures provide further evidence that manufacturers were quickly off the blocks in 2017 with strong growth in output and order books looking healthy, driven largely by domestic demand. Although the growing prospect of inflationary pressure looms large and the impact of Brexit continues to cause much uncertainty, it is encouraging to see that the manufacturing sector is just getting on with business as usual.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how the UK factories expanded in January: Dave Atkinson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, fears that factories will face further cost inflation in the coming months. There will be challenges ahead as import prices continue to rise, affecting bottom line profitability, while the impact of some companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 historical long-term currency hedging coming to an end may expose them to the devaluation of sterling that they have managed against to date. Worryingly, the export boost enjoyed by UK factories after the pound tumbled appears to be fading. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from Markit says: The domestic market was the prime source of new business wins in January. There was also a modest increase in new export orders, although the pace of expansion was noticeably slower than during the prior survey month. Where an increase in new work from overseas was reported, this was linked to improving global market conditions and the weak sterling exchange rate. Oh. My. Goodness. The costs paid by British factories for raw materials jumped at a record rate last month, as the weak pound bites. Data firm Markit says that the input costs paid by UK manufacturers surged in January, sending its input prices index to a jaw-dropping 88.3, up from 77.7 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since this survey began in 1992 [any reading over 50 shows prices going up]. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector kept growing strongly last month, with output accelerating to a 32-month high. More than half the firms surveyed by Markit blamed the fall in sterling since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum for the jump in input costs. The recent rally in the oil price is also a factor, as it drives up energy prices and the cost of plastic. There are also signs that factories are passing these costs onto consumers; Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output prices index posted one of its biggest jumps ever. Brace for higher inflation. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturers have reported a bumper start to 2017, but are also seeing prices rise at an unprecedented rate. Factory output growth accelerated to a 32-month high in January, as solid domestic demand continued to drive production volumes higher. There were signs that the boost to export orders from the weak exchange rate was waning, as growth of new business from abroad slowed sharply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big numbers coming out of the January survey were for the price measures. Input cost inflation spiked to the highest seen since data were first collected in 1992. Over 55% of companies link rising costs to the exchange rate. However, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also seeing more companies reporting domestic supplier price hikes resulting from the rising cost of commodities such as fuel, oil, plastics and steel. With cost pressures increasingly feeding though to higher selling prices at factories, it looks inevitable that consumer price inflation will rise further in coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The question is whether increased cost inflationary pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward. Companies seem fairly sanguine on this front, as a new index tracking business confidence signals optimism climbed to an eight- month high. Taken alongside robust output growth, rising new order inflows and job creation, all signs are pointing to a solid contribution to UK GDP from manufacturing during the opening quarter of 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek factories struggled in January due to particularly wintery weather, Markit reports: Greek manufacturers felt the effects of unexpected heavy snowfall in the opening month of the new year, with the health of the sector deteriorating at the sharpest pace since September 2015. The downturn was driven by marked declines in both output and new orders, subsequently leading firms to reduce their headcounts further. On the price front, input cost inflation accelerated to a 70-month high, however, firms lowered their selling prices. That led to the sharpest contraction in factory growth since autumn 2015. New orders fell, with new business from abroad shrinking for the fifth month running. Boom! Eurozone factories have posted their best month in almost six years, thanks to the strong growth in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone factory PMI, which tracks output and job creation across the sector, has risen to 55.2 in January, up from 54.9 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading in 69 months, before the eurozone debt crisis exploded in 2011. Firms say they enjoyed the strongest rise in new business since the first half of 2011, leading to a surge in job creation. New exports grew at their fastest pace in three years, helping production levels to rise for the 43th month in a row. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the weak euro is helping eurozone companies boost their exports (something that has upset the Trump administration, of course). Williamson explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eurozone manufacturing is off to a strong start to the year, enjoying the fastest rate of expansion for almost six years in January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rates of growth of new orders, exports and employment have all hit multi-year highs, with the depreciation of the euro playing a key role in helping drive new sales in export markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Optimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest since the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis, suggesting companies are maintaining a buoyant mood despite the heightened political uncertainty caused by Brexit and looming general elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflationary pressures are also picking up. Much of the increase in costs and prices can be linked to the weakened exchange rate and higher global commodity prices. However, there are also signs of demand running ahead of supply, which hints at a tentative build-up of core inflationary pressures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If current growth of manufacturing activity and the associated rise in prices is sustained, rhetoric at the ECB is likely to become more hawkish, albeit tempered with caution over the potential for political developments to cloud the outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany has also had a good month - with factory growth hitting the highest level in three years. Zut alors! France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has posted its best month in almost six years. The French manufacturing PMI jumped to 53.6 in January, the highest level in 68 months. Growth was driven by increases in output, new orders and employment, Markit says, Yesterday we learned that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.4% in the last three months of 2016 - today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report suggests growth remained solid this year. Alex Gill, Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Operating conditions in the French goods-producing sector continued to improve at the start of 2017. Underlying sector growth was the sharpest round of job creation in over five-and-a-half years, with firms buoyed by further marked expansions in both output and new orders. These are encouraging signs given the broad desire in France to reduce its level of unemployment. However, uncertainty surrounding the political environment, including May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential elections, may serve to dampen demand in coming months and provide a headwind to the resurgent labour market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has made a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsolid start\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 2017, says Markit. Its manufacturing PMI has come in at 53, showing slightly slower growth than December when it hit 53.2. Markit explains: Rates of growth in output and total new orders were slightly slower than in December, but the pace of job creation in the sector picked up to the highest for nine months. European stock markets are rallying in early trading, thanks to this flurry of good factory data from Europe and Asia. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 51 points, to 0.75%, back to 7151. Other markets are also a sea of green, as traders put their worries about Donald Trump behind them. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Decent manufacturing figures from China and Japan lifted the European indices ahead of their own PMIs this Wednesday morning. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI rose to a two-year high last month, up to 54.8 from 54.3. Dutch factories also recorded robust growth, but at a slightly slower rate -- the Netherlands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMI dipped to 56.5 from 57.3. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn to report factory data....and it looks good, with business sentiment rising and firms hiring more staff. That drove Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI to its highest level since May 2015, rising to 55.6 last month from 55.3. Markit says: The Spanish manufacturing sector started 2017 in a similar fashion to how it ended 2016, with sharp rises in output and new orders recorded. The key highlight from the latest survey was the sharpest rise in employment since July 1998, while business sentiment picked up. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have reported the fastest rise in manufacturing output for 18 months. Russian factories have grown at their fastest pace in 70 months, says Markit, thanks to a boost in new orders. The Russian factory PMI rose to 54.7 in January, up from 53.7. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since March 2011. Firms reported that they took on new staff to cope with a rise in new orders, which also led to a further build-up of backlogs of work. Samuel Agass, who compiled the survey, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russian manufacturers carried the momentum they built up during the closing stages of 2016 through to the new year, as firms recorded the sharpest improvement in operating conditions for nearly six years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sector continues to go from strength to strength, supported by robust demand for goods from domestic clients. Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector had a stellar January - growing at the fastest pace in over six years. Asian stock markets gained ground today, as traders digested the solid economic data from Japan and China. Tokyo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gained 0.5%, while Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX200 rose by 0.8%. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sensex index is up almost 1%, after Markit reported that its factories returned to growth in January thanks to rising order books. In another encouraging sign, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is growing at its fastest pace in almost three years. Markit reports that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in January, up from 52.4 - the highest reading since March 2014. Firms reported that output, new orders and employment all rose last month, Markit says: January data pointed to the sharpest increase in new work inflows since December 2015. Firms linked this to greater domestic and international demand as well as improved advertising. Reports of an increase in foreign demand was also backed by the survey data, with new export orders rising at the quickest rate in one year. Resulting from improved manufacturing conditions, manufacturers continued to hire additional workers in January. In fact, the rate of job-creation was little- changed from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 32-month high. China got PMI Day off to a good start by reporting that factory growth was near a two-year high in January. The official Chinese PMI came in at 51.3, slightly below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51.4, but still showing growth [anything over 50 points indicates the sector expanded]. Economists were relieved that the PMI came close to November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year high of 51.7, suggesting that China is still avoiding a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard landing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official non-manufacturing PMI, which tracks the services sector, rose to 54.6 in January from 54.5 in December. That indicates that growth picked up. Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard says that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services firms are helping to cushion problems in the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The breakdown suggests that an acceleration in service sector activity offset a slowdown in the construction sector, which has been hit by the cooling property market and a reduction in fiscal support. The upshot is that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent recovery appears to remain largely intact for now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new month, which means a flood of economic surveys showing how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories performed in January. Data firm Markit is reporting how manufacturing sectors across the the globe fared last month; this should help us see if the world economy began 2017 on the front foot. Overnight, the latest data from Asia has been quite encouraging (more in a moment). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key timings. 8.15am GMT: Spain 8.45am GMT: Italy 8.50am GMT: France 8.55am GMT: Germany 9am GMT: The eurozone 9.30am GMT: The UK 2.45pm GMT: The United States Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: In the euro area, the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main release is Spanish and Italian manufacturing PMIs for January. Both strengthened in December to recent highs; an 11-month high for Spain and a six month high for Italy. The readings in both look set to hold broadly at those levels in the January survey and we see no change this month as the manufacturing sector continues to benefit from buoyant euro area exports growth. Traders will also be waiting for the US Federal Reserve to announce its decision on monetary policy, at 7pm tonight. The Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to raise interest rates, but it might drop hints about the chances of a hike in March. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the currency markets closely, after one of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers claimed the euro was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grossly undervalued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yesterday. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably going to be more ructions in Greece, where the latest bailout review is mired in the sand again. Greek bond prices have been falling in recent days, on fears that talks with creditors are going nowhere, and some government MPs have begun speculating about a return to the drachma. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

There was observable shareholder glee that an era of ever-expanding regulation could be coming to an end under Donald Trump.</p> <p>Since Dodd Frank was introduced, banks have devoted a lot more capital towards compliance and have had to decrease leverage, both of which are a direct hit to profitability. If Dodd Frank is watered down, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a direct boost to the bottom line for banks.</p> <p>The changes to Dodd Frank are likely to be small to begin with but Trump is shifting the direction of travel from more regulation to less regulation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing for the financial sector, and less red tape is good for corporate America as a whole. Trump turning his attention to deregulation could be just the boost Wall Street needs to send the Dow back above the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>Too much regulation favours the large institutions who can afford the extra compliance costs.</p> <p>Unwinding some of Dodd Frank is a good thing because it will enable smaller community banks to compete, offering competition to consumers.</p> <p>Repealing too much of Dodd Frank puts the entire system at risk of a repeat of 2008. The red line is the Volker rule; if the big banks can engage in proprietary trading, then depositors will be put at much greater risk. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5894a0cae4b0c64fe7016e8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-03T15:25:29.088Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>President Trump is meeting with business leaders and it appears the plans for the financial sector are on the agenda:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/827537349420732416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Pres.

You can say that it was a super solid number because it was well ahead of expectations. This week we had a number disappointing news with respect to what traders were expecting, for instance, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event.</p> <p>It is not all good news when it comes to the US jobs number because if you peel the layers, it shows that the downside surprise is in the wage report and a lot of disappointment there. We still need to see more readings before we can see that there is a trend because this number is full with noise.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the hourly wage growth has gathered the most momentum recently and fuelled this concern among traders that the Fed is behind the curve, while inflation is picking up steam. Clearly, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number has put cold water on that. Moreover, if you are interested in a rate hike, then clearly you need to know that the Fed cannot move until they have a clear idea what the fiscal spending will be and that is the reality which market needs to digest. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan.</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515497449074688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bottom line: Jobs numbers confirm the US economy is still motoring along nicely at a good clip\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfast enough to keep pushing unemployment down</p>&mdash; Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515497449074688\">February 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515844297003009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The big question remains how much slack remains in the labor market, and how many folks we can pull back into the labor force.</p>&mdash; Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515844297003009\">February 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Tanweer Akram of Thrivent</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Continued improvement in the labor market in the U.S. strengthens the case of the Fed remaining on course to gradually tighten monetary policy in the coming months</strong>.

Higher input prices will, in time, shift into selling prices otherwise firms will see their profits shrink. In line with the Manufacturing and Construction PMI, this points to inflation continuing its recent surge in the months ahead.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Headline activity, although falling back slightly, suggests the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy pace, but one has to question its sustainability. Can the UK economy keep pace as inflation erodes the spending power of the consumer? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism that households will continue to whittle away their savings to support spending. Our conviction strengthened today with the softer outlook for employment highlighted in this survey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <h2>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Services have been the key UK growth driver along with consumer spending and January survey evidence for both has been softer. While these are surveys rather than hard data and not too much should be read into one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, it nevertheless fuels our suspicion that the UK economy will find life increasing difficult during 2017 and that growth will gradually lose buoyancy like a slow puncture.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are some helpful economic ingredients that are keeping the PMI in positive territory. Healthy levels of employment and low interest rates mean consumers continue to spend. Business confidence has also been buoyed by a stronger than expected economic performance in 2016, and is likely to be further boosted by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved growth forecast from the Bank of England.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, some uncertainty remains and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a cautious approach towards making major investment decisions across the services sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58944df6e4b0c64fe7016ce1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-03T09:40:39.883Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK service sector growth slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew slower than expected last month, as firms were hit by rising prices.</strong></p> <p>The Services PMI, which tracks activity in the dominant part of the UK economy, dropped to 54.5 for January from 56.2 in December, a bigger slowdown than expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/827451714986979329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK service sector growth slows more than expected in January.

                "bodyText":"Financial shares were boosted by the prospect of Donald Trump rowing back on regulation, while a rise in the oil price after new US sanctions on Iran lifted energy stocks. So markets moved sharply higher, with the FTSE 100 recording its best one day rise so far this year. Even a fall in mining shares as China raised interest rates could not undermine the positive mood. Better than expected US jobs figures also gave some support, pushing Wall Street higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average back through the 20,000 level. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 47.55 points or 0.67% at 7188.30 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.2% to 11,651.49 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.65% at 4825.42 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 1.2% higher at 19,116.04 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.6% at 9462.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.94% to 628.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.9% at 20,062, above the 20,000 barrier for the first time all week. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action on financial regulation is imminent it seems: Oil prices are higher as the US unveiled a number of new sanctions on various companies and individuals following a recent missile test. Reuters reports: The United States on Friday sanctioned 13 individuals and 12 entities under its Iran sanctions authority, days after the White House put Tehran \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over a ballistic missile test and other activities. In a statement on its website, the U.S. Treasury listed the sanctioned individuals and entities, some of which are based in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and China. The move is the first against Iran since U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The sanctions were similar to actions taken by the Obama administration targeting Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ballistic missile network. The new designations stuck to areas that remain under sanctions even with the 2015 nuclear deal in place, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ballistic missile program. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action is part of Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing efforts to counterIranian malign activity abroad that is outside the scope of the JCPOA,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasury said, a reference to the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Among those sanctioned on Friday were companies, individuals, and brokers the U.S. Treasury said support a trade network run by an Iranian businessman, Abdollah Asgharzadeh. The news has seen Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate climb around 1%. There is a fine line to tread when making changes to Dodd-Franks, said Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group: Reports that Donald Trump is preparing to scale back financial regulations in the US is a boon for multinational \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmegabanks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which have seen profits drop since the heady days before the 2008 financial crisis. Shares of Visa, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were all atop the US benchmark. There was observable shareholder glee that an era of ever-expanding regulation could be coming to an end under Donald Trump. Since Dodd Frank was introduced, banks have devoted a lot more capital towards compliance and have had to decrease leverage, both of which are a direct hit to profitability. If Dodd Frank is watered down, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a direct boost to the bottom line for banks. The changes to Dodd Frank are likely to be small to begin with but Trump is shifting the direction of travel from more regulation to less regulation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing for the financial sector, and less red tape is good for corporate America as a whole. Trump turning his attention to deregulation could be just the boost Wall Street needs to send the Dow back above the 20,000 mark. Too much regulation favours the large institutions who can afford the extra compliance costs. Unwinding some of Dodd Frank is a good thing because it will enable smaller community banks to compete, offering competition to consumers. Repealing too much of Dodd Frank puts the entire system at risk of a repeat of 2008. The red line is the Volker rule; if the big banks can engage in proprietary trading, then depositors will be put at much greater risk. President Trump is meeting with business leaders and it appears the plans for the financial sector are on the agenda: Unlike the Markit survey, another report on the services sector has come in below expectations, although still showing a strong performance. The ISM non-manufactuing PMI was 56.5 in January, virtually flat on the 56.6 recorded the previous month and slightly below expectations of a figure of 57. Meanwhile factory orders in December rose by 1.3% compared to estimates of a 1% increase, and a 2.3% fall in November. Back with the Dow, and it is clear that the financial sector is on the rise thanks to the idea that Donald Trump will row back on regulation: The first of two surveys of the US service sector has shown a better than expected performance last month. The Markit service sector PMI for January came in at 55.6 compared to an initial estimate of 55.1 and December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 53.9. This was the highest reading since November 2015. The Markit Composite index, which includes services and manufacturing, was 55.8, up from 54.1 in December. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US economy has started 2017 on the front foot. Business activity across the economy is growing at the fastest rate for over a year and optimism about the business outlook has risen to the highest for a year and a half. The January surveys signal annualized GDP growth of approximately 2.5%, setting the scene for a solid first quarter. With January seeing the largest inflow of new business for 18 months, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good reason to believe that firms will be even busier in coming months. Even more encouraging is the ongoing impressive rate of job creation, with the January PMI numbers comparable to around 200,000 jobs being added. A waning of price pressures takes some heat off the Fed, though the sustained strong output and jobs growth signalled by the surveys will fuel speculation that the next rate hike will be sooner rather than later, with June looking most likely. US markers are on the rise after the better than expected headline jobs figure, with financial companies also benefitting from the prospect of looser regulation if Donald Trump scraps the Dodd-Frank legislation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 96 points or 0.48% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.26% better. The mixed picture from the non-farm figures - positive jobs numbers, weaker than expected wages growth - also saw some volatility in the currency markets as traders tried to work out the implications for US interest rates. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The dollar initially reacted positively, however, within minutes the dollar index backed off highs as the foreign exchange market took stock of some of the weaker elements of the report. US stock market futures moved higher and are predicting a stronger open for the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq. However, the bond market was less impressed, and US treasury yields fell across the curve, the two-year yield is currently down 5 basis points, which could weigh on the buck further on Friday. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls report, on its own, will be a game changer for the Fed, and the market is still pricing in the prospect of another rate hike from the Fed by mid-year; after all wage growth at 2.5% is still above the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target inflation rate. However, we will be watching the development of wages, which are a key metric for the Federal Reserve going forward. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up again for February then Federal Reserve rate hike expectations may start to get pushed further out to the second half of 2017, which could limit dollar upside in the medium term. The yield, or interest rate, on US government bonds has fallen since the jobs report came out. Traders are betting that the weak wage growth last month means the Fed is even less likely to raise interest rates in March. Wall Street and City economists broadly agree that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report shows America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains robust, although the mediocre wage growth is a disappointment. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics: The 227,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in January suggests that the labour market started the year on a reasonably solid footing. However, the drop back in annual wage growth is another reason to think the Fed will hold off raising interest rates until June. Kully Samra, Charles Schwab U.K. Managing Director: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs numbers coupled with most other economic data points this week demonstrate the ongoing resilience and strength of the US economy. The figures also corroborate the findings of the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker, which has generally continued on an upward trend over the last quarter. This is a further indicator of both momentum in the wider domestic economy and that a tighter job market is boosting job security and overall pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weekly jobless claims remain near a multi-decade low and appear healthy enough to keep the low unemployment rate intact. A strong job market, inflection points in the wider economic data and corporate earnings, alongside increased consumer and business confidence, should be a cause for optimism amongst investors in US equities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: The US NFP data has confirmed that the lavish party in the employment sector is still somewhat solid, especially if you look at the headline number. You can say that it was a super solid number because it was well ahead of expectations. This week we had a number disappointing news with respect to what traders were expecting, for instance, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. It is not all good news when it comes to the US jobs number because if you peel the layers, it shows that the downside surprise is in the wage report and a lot of disappointment there. We still need to see more readings before we can see that there is a trend because this number is full with noise. There is no doubt that the hourly wage growth has gathered the most momentum recently and fuelled this concern among traders that the Fed is behind the curve, while inflation is picking up steam. Clearly, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number has put cold water on that. Moreover, if you are interested in a rate hike, then clearly you need to know that the Fed cannot move until they have a clear idea what the fiscal spending will be and that is the reality which market needs to digest. Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan. Tanweer Akram of Thrivent Continued improvement in the labor market in the U.S. strengthens the case of the Fed remaining on course to gradually tighten monetary policy in the coming months. Even though last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job growth was strong, the FOMC will be cautious in tightening monetary policy because of considerable uncertainty about economic policy and global conditions. A key challenge for the new administration will be to lift growth in both workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compensation and labor productivity. Infrastructure spending, lower taxes, business friendly attitude, and more streamlined regulations would be beneficial to the economy. However, higher tariffs, restrictive immigration policies, protectionism, lack of action on global climate change, and various erratic policies would be harmful. Richard de Meo, Managing Director of Foenix Partners. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non Farms print was as strong as last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was disappointing, yet the reflex dollar rally was quickly given back as traders cast their eyes through the detail of an underwhelming overall jobs report. Seasonal challenges relating to January data should be taken into account, yet the fall in average earnings to 0.1% and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.8% might cause a slight stir across the FOMC, who just this week expressed their comfort with the labour sector. A binary assessment of upcoming Fed decisions would point to a minimal but negative impact to rate expectations, yet the stronger message to emerge is that US businesses confidence is on the rise and, in the process, already helping Trump towards his 4% GDP target. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve grabbed some nice charts off Bloomberg TV, showing how today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report compared to Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts.... ...and also showing how wage growth dipped: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report: The US added 227,000 new jobs in January, the last month of the Obama presidency and the first of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the Department of Labor announced on Friday. The closely watched figure was the best since last June and comes after Trump won the election promising jobs growth and pushing US companies to employ American citizens, threatening to tax imports of goods made outside US borders. However, the report also highlights the struggle ahead for Trump and underlines Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record on job creation. January marked the 76th consecutive month of job gains, the best on record. And the unemployment rate, at 4.8%, is in line with the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate for a normal job market. Trump was a harsh critic of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report during the election campaign. He claimed that 5% unemployment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In August 2015, Trump told Time magazine that the real unemployment rate was 42%, at the time the Labor Department reading was 5.1%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Another reason to be worried about US earnings: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction, first from bond trading magnate Bill Gross: This is from James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Weisenthal suggests there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little pressure on the US central bank to hike rates fast. Economist Shaun Richards points out that wage growth is still modest, even though the US economy is creating more jobs. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force participation rate, which measures everyone working or available for work, has risen to 62.9% from 62.7%. That implies that some economically inactive people started looking for work again last month (and is one reason the jobless rate rose to 4.8%). The number of Americans who would like to work more hours went up last month. The U6 rate, which measure unemployment and underemployment, has risen to 9.4% from 9.2%. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report has been revised, to show that only 164,000 new jobs were created, not 204,000 as first thought. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data has been revised up by 1,000, to 157,000. The wages figure is a disappointment! Average earnings only rose by 0.1% month-on-month in January, dashing hopes of a 0.3% gain. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has risen to 4.8%, from 4.7% in December. BREAKING: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created 227,000 new jobs in January, as the Obama administration ended and the Trump administration began. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than economists had expected, and suggests that the US economy began 2017 in good health. More to follow! Tension is building, with just five minutes to go.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the US jobs report.... the first Non-Farm Payroll on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch. Of course, Trump only took office on January 20th, so he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credited or blamed for the state of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labo(u)r market. Of course, some firms will have made hiring decisions since the election on 9th November, but the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies will only be seen in NFP reports later this year and beyond. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is effectively the starting point against which Trump will be judged. A reminder: economists are expecting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report to be pretty decent, with around 180,000 new jobs created last month. The unemployment rate may also remain low, at 4.7%.... ...however, Trump has criticised these figures for not showing the true picture in the jobs market. His team favour another measure, called U5, which includes people who have given up looking for work. That rate is currently running at 5.7%. Economists will also be looking at the wage growth figures. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 0.3% during January, with the annual increase dipping to 2.8% from 2.9% in December. The Daily Telegraph have just published a handy explanation to the Dodd-Frank legislation. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snippet: If Dodd-Frank made banks safer, why is it being reviewed? Scrapping legislation that stifles businesses was a central plank of Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election campaign, playing to his image as a successful tycoon who made billions in the private sector. Last November, he described Dodd-Frank as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mr Trump, who has also previously argued that Dodd-Frank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made it impossible for bankers to function\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dismantle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the law and replace it with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last week, while signing an executive order aimed at reducing regulations, he described Dodd-Frank as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Republicans have long been opposed to the law. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that time of the day when the US president wakes up, opens Twitter, and addresses the world.... However, that meeting won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include Travis Kalanick, the boss of Uber, who resigned from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisory council following heavy criticism -- and a campaign to delete Uber. In other banking news, Deutsche Bank is planning to cut 17% of its equities staff and 6% of its fixed-income staff globally, according to the Wall Street Journal. It would be the latest stage in CEO John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to cut costs and return the company to profit (it reported a $2bn loss yesterday). Earlier today, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government rejected claims from the Trump administration that it unfairly manipulates its currency. Government spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing that China hopes to resolve concerns over global trade through talks, not through tit-for-tat devaluations. Lu said: China has never and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use a currency war to seek advantage in trade or to raise competitiveness in trade. We have no intention of fighting a currency war. From a long-term perspective this is not beneficial to China. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Earlier this week, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade adviser caused a stir by claiming that Germany was getting an unfair advantage through the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grossly undervalued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd euro. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has now hit back, pointing out that Berlin doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually control the euro.... Mining shares are falling after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank raised short term interest rates overnight. That is holding back the FTSE 100, which is up 30 points thanks to the Trump-induced rally in bank shares. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: The mining sector has slipped back this morning after a disappointing Chinese manufacturing survey as well as slight tightening of money market rates by Chinese authorities. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not immediately clear what prompted this action, though there is speculation about rising concerns about a property bubble, and this slight rise could well be an attempt to warn that tighter policy is on the way. Glencore, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Anglo-American PLC and Rio Tinto have all slipped lower at the open. On the upside banking shares have gained a lift on speculation that US President Trump may well sign a new executive order to roll back some of the Dodd Frank regulatory bill, helping push Barclays and RBS higher. Shares in banks and insurance groups are rallying in London, following the reports that president Trump will take steps to dismantle regulations brought in to prevent another financial crisis. The prospect of Trump blocking president Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiduciary rules also seem to be boosting demand for financial stocks. They were due to come into force in April, compelling financial advisors to recommend the best product to clients, not simply a suitable one. Barclays are leading the FTSE risers, up 2.5%, followed by Prudential, and Royal Bank of Scotland. Chris Beauchamp of City trading firm IG says: UK bank stocks are higher across the board this morning, after the magic words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDodd-Frank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrepeal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 flashed across screens last night; leaving aside the political implications, the news could provide a tonic for the sector. Trump cannot simply demolish the Dodd-Frank rules on his own, but his executive orders still carry weight. The FT has a good explanation: Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is now director of the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Economic Council, said Mr Trump would sign executive orders preparing the way to fulfil a campaign pledge to dismantle parts of Dodd-Frank. However, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pull apart the sweeping reforms on his own is limited. Only Congress can make major revisions to the act it passed in 2010, but Mr Trump can use the orders to signal his priorities and instruct regulators enforcing the law. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mr Cohn, who stepped down as a top executive at Goldman Sachs to take the White House job. Economists are concerned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector slowed last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Dean Turner, UK Economist, UBS Wealth Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The most notable aspect of the Services PMI was the ongoing strength of the input prices index, which rose again and is now above 60 level for the fourth consecutive month. Higher input prices will, in time, shift into selling prices otherwise firms will see their profits shrink. In line with the Manufacturing and Construction PMI, this points to inflation continuing its recent surge in the months ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Headline activity, although falling back slightly, suggests the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy pace, but one has to question its sustainability. Can the UK economy keep pace as inflation erodes the spending power of the consumer? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism that households will continue to whittle away their savings to support spending. Our conviction strengthened today with the softer outlook for employment highlighted in this survey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Services have been the key UK growth driver along with consumer spending and January survey evidence for both has been softer. While these are surveys rather than hard data and not too much should be read into one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, it nevertheless fuels our suspicion that the UK economy will find life increasing difficult during 2017 and that growth will gradually lose buoyancy like a slow puncture. Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are some helpful economic ingredients that are keeping the PMI in positive territory. Healthy levels of employment and low interest rates mean consumers continue to spend. Business confidence has also been buoyed by a stronger than expected economic performance in 2016, and is likely to be further boosted by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved growth forecast from the Bank of England. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, some uncertainty remains and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a cautious approach towards making major investment decisions across the services sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew slower than expected last month, as firms were hit by rising prices. The Services PMI, which tracks activity in the dominant part of the UK economy, dropped to 54.5 for January from 56.2 in December, a bigger slowdown than expected. Firms said that new business and employment also increased at slower rates, and their backlog of outstanding work fell a little. And there are also signs that raw material prices are ballooning ahead, due to the weaker pound. Bad news for UK energy customers... Npower has just announced it will raise the cost of its dual fuel package by almost 10%. The move will hurt around half of its customers, putting \u00c2\u00a3100 on the average annual bill. And where one energy firm leads, the others tend to follow... Investors often flock to gold in time of nervousness. And Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win has helped to push demand for bullion up to its highest level since the eurozone debt crisis was raging. Good news! The Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has kept growing at the fastest pace in five and a half years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has just come in at 54.4 for January, matching December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading - the highest since mid-2012. That shows robust growth, with job creation hitting its fastest rate since 2008. But...firms also warned that input costs are rising at the fastest rate in over five- and-a-half years That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to higher global commodity prices, increased import costs due to the weak euro and supplier price hikes. Overall, the report suggests eurozone growth is gathering pace, according to Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan. He says: Although Germany has decelerated somewhat in the recent months, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs are clearly pointing to accelerating GDP growth in the Eurozone in 2017. In addition, the rate of job creation - the fastest since February 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indicates that this momentum could be sustained in the coming months. Going forward, it will be important to keep an eye on cost pressures which continue to intensify. The companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to pass these higher costs onto consumers will be critical to support margins and the earnings recovery we anticipate. President Trump makes the front page of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Economist: And their leader column says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies are right to be worried by the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early moves: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: WASHINGTON is in the grip of a revolution. The bleak cadence of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration was still in the air when Donald Trump lobbed the first Molotov cocktail of policies and executive orders against the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brilliant-white porticos. He has not stopped. Quitting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, demanding a renegotiation of NAFTA and a wall with Mexico, overhauling immigration, warming to Brexit-bound Britain and Russia, cooling to the European Union, defending torture, attacking the press: onward he and his people charged, leaving the wreckage of received opinion smouldering in their wake.... More here: An insurgent in the White House Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock election victory has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marginally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd good for the UK economy, according to one of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent argued that Britain has benefitted from the jump in financial confidence following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win last November. Speaking to BBC Breakfast TV, Broadbent said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen business confidence rise particularly in the United States. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen financial markets get more optimistic and I think that has had some impact on us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far, at the margin, yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been positive for global sentiment, and for that reason, and to that extent, for us as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadbent also cautioned, though, that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what Trump will do: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I should say overall that... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot we have yet to see about the detailed plans, including those for fiscal policy, for government spending and taxes and so forth, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait and see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday the Bank of England hiked its growth forecasts for the UK economy this year, prompting criticism that it was too gloomy after the EU referendum result. Laurie Macfarlane of the New Economics Foundation is concerned that removing financial regulations could lead to trouble: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Grant also has concerns: But the move could drive stock markets higher, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital, especially if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report is a zinger. President Trump will meet with the bosses of some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest financial firms today, before signing executive orders to review Dodd-Frank and stall the Obama fiduciary rule. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to see Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Blackrock boss Laurence Fink and JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon, among others That may not dispel concerns that the new administration is batting for the banking sector, rather than the public. For example, Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiduciary rules are means to protect millions of retired Americans from being missold investments by brokers, to get bumper profits. However, the White House line is that removing regulations is good for investors, which is why they want the rule rescinded. As Bloomberg puts it: The two executive actions are designed to lay out the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to financial markets, with an emphasis on removing regulatory burdens and opening up investor options, said the White House official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Some breaking news from America.... US president Donald Trump is expected to start unpicking some of the rules created after the 2008 crisis to to rein in the financial sector. US media are reporting that Trump will order a review of the Dodd-Frank rules, which are designed to stop banks being too reckless. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also apparently planning to sign another executive action that could halt President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiduciary Rules. This regulation forces retirement advisers to work in the best interests of their clients; Trump will ask the US labor secretary to consider rescinding it, reports say. The Dodd-Frank rules were a major attempt to avoid a repeat of the crisis that brought down Lehman Brothers. They force banks to be more transparent, provide extra consumer protection, and are meant to prevent the kind of risks that led to the meltdown of the sector nine years ago. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also unpopular with banks, who argue that they restrict business. Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, has told the Wall Street Journal that unravelling these safeguards will be good for consumers (as well as the banks, of course!). Cohn (a former president of Goldman Sachs) argued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Donald Trump Plans to Undo Dodd-Frank Law, Fiduciary Rule Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump once promised to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the greatest jobs president God ever created\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out whether his rise to the White House has had any impact on the US labour market yet. The latest US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP), due at 1.30pm GMT (8.30am East Coast), will show how many new jobs were created across America last month, whether wages rose, and whether more people were lured back to the jobs market. Economists expect a fairly solid report. The payroll is expected to rise by around 180,000 jobs leaving the unemployment rate at a healthy-looking 4.7%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suggests we could get an even stronger report: This would suggest that the 180k estimate being predicted is probably too low, with a figure in excess of 200k not being beyond the realms of possibility. Such a high number given an unemployment rate of 4.7%, would suggest that there is probably still a fair degree of slack in the jobs market. Wages are also likely to be closely watched with a rise of 0.3% expected, with an annualised rise of 2.8%, down slightly from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.9%. The report could easily move the markets, as the strength of the US jobs market will determine how quickly the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates this year. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest healthcheck on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies today. These Purchasing Managers Index (PMIs) reports are expected to show decent growth last month, suggesting the world economy began 2017 in good spirits despite the political uncertainty. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the timings: 9am GMT: Eurozone (with a breakdown for each country) 9.30am GMT: UK 2.45pm GMT: US The financial markets are expected to be calm, as traders wait for the NFP numbers: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

He stuck like glue to the current ECB script.Indeed, the ECB seemingly retains an easing bias in its policy stance despite the recent jump in Eurozone inflation to 1.8% in January (and improved GDP growth of 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016).</p> <p>The only potential change of ECB monetary policy that Mr. Draghi mentioned in his testimony to the European parliament was that the size and/or duration of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly asset purchase program could be increased if inflation developments become less favourable or monetary conditions less helpful to a sustainable achievement of the inflation target. There was no mention of the ECB reducing its asset purchase programme following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adjustments....</p> <p>Mr. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony fuels belief that the ECB will not be making any changes to its monetary policy for some time to come, following its December manoeuvres. The ECB clearly wants to see sustained, decisive evidence that underling inflationary pressures are picking up. And while the ECB is relatively upbeat on Eurozone growth prospects, it is very aware that there are appreciable uncertainties ahead, especially political ones (elections in Netherlands, France and Germany, the Brexit process starting and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency in the US)...</p> <p>We suspect the ECB will end up extending its monthly asset purchases into 2018, but at a reducing rate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58989f2be4b0e3890bcea229\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T16:18:44.206Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On Greece, Draghi said there had been many changes made in Greece, significant progress had been made.</p> <p>He added that the conclusion of the second review depended on a number of factors: for a positive assessment of debt sustainability, there should be a 3.5% primary surplus for a long period of time, that is one point of negotiation; the second point concerns the closing of fiscal gap for 2018; the third point concerns a certain set of structural reforms - labour market reform, judiciary, energy.

On the latter point, I look forward to the continued support of the European Parliament in the second half of this legislative term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-589881f5e4b0127a514cd30a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T14:03:42.968Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB prepared to increase QE programme if necessary - Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There have been signs of inflationary pressures in the eurozone, prompting speculation that the ECB might have to rein in its stimulus measures. But Draghi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our December decisions strike a balance between our growing confidence that the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects are firming up, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the same time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lack of a clear sign of sustained convergence of inflation rates towards the desired level. </p> <p>On the one hand, the evidence suggests that the acute deflation risks have disappeared and that inflation is set to pick up over the coming years. And contrary to a widespread perception, euro area economic conditions have also been steadily improving. Euro area GDP growth has been solid in every quarter since the beginning of 2015, averaging 1.9 percent in annualised terms. Compared to 2013, there are 3.5 million fewer unemployed in the euro area, a decrease by more than 18%. And in the last quarter, the recovery has been broadening across sectors and across countries. Indeed, the dispersion of value added growth across euro area countries and sectors has declined sharply and stands close to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro.</p> <p>But support from our monetary policy measures is still needed if inflation rates are to converge towards our objective with sufficient confidence and in a sustained manner. The pickup in headline inflation in December and in January largely reflects sizeable upward base effects and recent increases in energy prices. So far underlying inflation pressures remain very subdued and are expected to pick up only gradually as we go on. This lack of momentum in underlying inflation reflects largely weak domestic cost pressures. The still significant degree of labour market slack and weak productivity developments are weighing down on wage growth. </p> <p>As I have argued before, our monetary policy strategy prescribes that we should not react to individual data points and short-lived increases in inflation. Our relevant policy horizon is the medium term. We therefore continue to look through changes in HICP {headline] inflation if we believe they do not durably affect the medium-term outlook for price stability.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, risks to the euro area outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. Our current monetary policy stance foresees that, if the inflation outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council is prepared to increase the asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T14:20:44.475Z\">at 2.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-589881ace4b06d9b044c0ffd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T14:01:50.391Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European Bank president Mario Draghi appears before the European parliament, <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2017/html/sp170206.en.html\">his speech has been released here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58987c6be4b0127a514cd2ed\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-06T13:57:00.839Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a quick recap.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/06/british-bosses-brexit-german-factory-orders-draghi-gig-economy-live?page=with:block-58982adee4b0e481c6e4b167#block-58982adee4b0e481c6e4b167\">More than half of UK business leaders have reported that Brexit is already hurting their businesses, even before article 50 is triggered</a>.</strong></p> <p>IPSOS Mori found that 58% of top executives at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies have experienced a negative impact, with most 65% expecting things to be worse in five years. </p> <p><strong>Ben Page, CEO of Ipsos MORI, says</strong>: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unfortunately, it looks like business in this country is already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU, with 58% of Captains of Industry stating that their business has suffered negatively since the referendum.

                "bodyText":"Worries about the forthcoming elections in France and Germany helped send European markets lower, with ECB president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish comments on monetary policy dented the euro.

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to shut for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. ECB president Mario Draghi used his latest appearance at the European parliament to maintain that, contrary to US claims, Germany and the central bank were not currency manipulators. He also said the idea of rowing back on financial regulation - another proposal from the Trump administration - was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worrisome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on it: Mario Draghi took the Trump administration to task, rebutting recent assertions that Germany is a currency manipulator and warning against the rollback of post-crisis financial regulation. Speaking at a hearing of European lawmakers in Brussels on Monday, the European Central Bank president responded to the charge by U.S. National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro and others that Germany is using a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grossly undervalued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd euro to gain an unfair trade advantage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ECB has not intervened in the foreign exchange markets since 2011,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi said, adding that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus was the result of productivity gains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Germany has a significant bilateral trade surplus with the U.S., a material current account surplus, but it has not engaged in persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a question-and-answer session punctuated with lawmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns over the shifts in global economic and financial policy brought about by the change of government in Washington, Draghi also hit out at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves to begin dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act. Rolling back the compendium of financial rules intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very worrisome,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing we need at this point in time is a relaxation in regulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frankly I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any reason to relax the present regulatory stance which has produced a stronger banking and financial services industry than before the crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Commenting on Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the European parliament Howard Archer, chief European and UK cconomist at IHS Global Insight, said: Mario Draghi does not look like a man intending to change tack on monetary policy any time soon. He stuck like glue to the current ECB script.Indeed, the ECB seemingly retains an easing bias in its policy stance despite the recent jump in Eurozone inflation to 1.8% in January (and improved GDP growth of 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016). The only potential change of ECB monetary policy that Mr. Draghi mentioned in his testimony to the European parliament was that the size and/or duration of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly asset purchase program could be increased if inflation developments become less favourable or monetary conditions less helpful to a sustainable achievement of the inflation target. There was no mention of the ECB reducing its asset purchase programme following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adjustments.... Mr. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony fuels belief that the ECB will not be making any changes to its monetary policy for some time to come, following its December manoeuvres. The ECB clearly wants to see sustained, decisive evidence that underling inflationary pressures are picking up. And while the ECB is relatively upbeat on Eurozone growth prospects, it is very aware that there are appreciable uncertainties ahead, especially political ones (elections in Netherlands, France and Germany, the Brexit process starting and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency in the US)... We suspect the ECB will end up extending its monthly asset purchases into 2018, but at a reducing rate. On Greece, Draghi said there had been many changes made in Greece, significant progress had been made. He added that the conclusion of the second review depended on a number of factors: for a positive assessment of debt sustainability, there should be a 3.5% primary surplus for a long period of time, that is one point of negotiation; the second point concerns the closing of fiscal gap for 2018; the third point concerns a certain set of structural reforms - labour market reform, judiciary, energy. I would add one, the non performing loan handling, to give renewed strength of the banking system. And with that Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony is at an end. For inflation to be 2%, it will have to be higher in Germany (since it will be lower elsewhere). So what level would you like to see? Inflation differentials are not a new thing. Our objective is defined as the inflation rate for whole eurozone not individual countries. On Greece, Draghi said: Back with Draghi at the European Parliament. Question on when the ECB will exit its current monetary policy programme. Draghi effectively repeats previous answers, saying our objective is an inflation rate close but below 2% in medium term. We have to be convinced of a durable convergence to that objective. And it has to be for the whole of the eurozone, these are the questions we look at for changing monetary policy. And another on the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on financial regulation. Draghi says we have to see what exactly US wants to do, but I repeat, the combination of easy money and financial deregulation was exactly the ground on whch the financial crisis developed. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any reason to relax the present regulatory stance. Speaking of the euro, analysts at JP Morgan have said the single currency could fall by up to 10% if Marine Le Pen wins the French presidential election. On the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves during Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The ECB chief reiterated that while the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline inflation may have picked up, the underlying CPI readings remains muted, meaning that for the time being the region is still in need of the stimulus being pumped into it every month. This was received poorly by the euro, which sank by half a percent against the dollar, giving up much of the growth it managed at the end of January; against the pound, however, the currency actually saw its losses shrink to just 0.1%, down from the 0.3% it had seen earlier in the session. Interestingly it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the euro perturbed by Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement; both the DAX and CAC fell around 1% as the day went on, though admittedly the German and, especially, French indices may also be troubled by the launch of Marine Le Pen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign. Question about the future of clearing post-Brexit. Draghi says its too early to take a stance on the regulatory framework necessary [for clearing] when the UK leaves the EU. The US Federal Reserve has raised rates, should it be a model for others? What is the situation with relations with the Federal Reserve and the US (in the light of the letter from the new US administration to the Fed about putting America first)? Draghi says he cannot comment on other regulators but adds, if I was sent a similar letter, I would say we all benefit from having a central bank, and regulators, with the input of public consultations. This has produced extremely valuable results, with much more robust financial system. Given such interlinkage today we especially need this. But are the central banks, the supervisors etc the ones who have the final say. No, it is always the legislators who have ultimate say. In a question about the future of the euro and whether it is reversible, Draghi says it is not. Question referring to whether the euro is being manipulated, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade advisor last week accused Germany of doing. Draghi responds by quoting a US document: In 2016, the US treasury said Germany does not manipulate its currency, since it does not fit the criteria. Question from Netherlands: is ECB monetary policy data driven not date driven (similar to the Fed)? Draghi says we need an inflation rate which satisfies the four conditions needed. Suppose we withdraw our support, what will happen. Will inflation drop or continue its convergence to target. If second, we can start withdrawing support. Is cyber security high enough up on agenda? We definitely need to step up our efforts, says Draghi. In all sectors we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been severely underprepared. A quantum leap is needed in all sectors, including in financial sector. And there is no set benchmark, since progress of cyber crime is always moving. We have to work hard to develop safer and better standards. What should be Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy in light of US comments last week (ie, the proposal from Donald Trump to row back Dodd-Frank banking regulations). Draghi says again, it is still early to say. But looking at the historical experience, what were the main reasons for the financial crisis? ....A combination of too expansive monetary policy and a dismantling of financial regulations. Now we have expansive monetary policy, so the last thing we need at this point is a relaxation of regulations. The fact we are not seeing significant financial stability risks is the reward of the actions that regulators and legislators have been undertaking since the financial crisis erupted. Financial intermediaries are now stronger, so the idea of repeating the situation in place before crisis is very worrisome. And after a little applause, the questions. There are signs of global trade moving from liberalism to protectionism in some important countries, how do you see these risks? Draghi says it is too early to say, we would look with worry about potential announcements about protectionist measures. The EU was created on the foundation of free trade, on the four freedoms. We will judge when we see what has been announced. Draghi says he sees no signs of asset bubbles: Currently, we do not see compelling evidence at the euro area level of stretched asset valuations. Both corporate bond spreads and equity prices appear to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Similarly, real estate price growth remains moderate in the area as a whole, although significant cross-country heterogeneity is observable. This assessment is corroborated by the fact that credit growth is still modest, which suggests that asset price developments are not accompanied by increasing leverage. Nevertheless, the longer the accommodative measures need to be kept in place, the greater the risks of unwarranted side effects on the financial system become. For instance, asset prices may increase to levels that are not in line with fundamentals because investors might be tempted to take on more risk during times of low yields. Such developments are best addressed by enacting appropriate macro and micro prudential policies. Following the release of Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, the euro has hit a one week low against the dollar. Draghi noted that the ECB was prepared to increase its asset purchase programme if necessary in terms of both size and duration. Draghi concludes by repeating his call for political reforms: As I argued last week in Ljubljana, and as the crisis has shown, the benefits of the single currency can only be fully reaped if we have policies and institutions at national and European level that ensure it works for everyone. In the run-up to the launch of the euro, there was a strong commitment to advancing along the path of institutional and economic convergence. The crisis showed that this commitment cannot be relaxed. In fact, it remains fully relevant today as we seek to strengthen EMU and the EU in the face of current uncertainties and in preparation for future challenges. The euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience in 2016 despite a range of negative shocks shows that we are on the right track. It also suggests that reforms at national and European level are paying off in terms of economic growth. As the economic situation improves, and even though challenges in other policy realms have understandably been the recent focus of our attention, we should not stop our efforts to make EMU more resilient and prosperous. We can and should address the remaining, well-identified fragilities at national and European level. On the latter point, I look forward to the continued support of the European Parliament in the second half of this legislative term. There have been signs of inflationary pressures in the eurozone, prompting speculation that the ECB might have to rein in its stimulus measures. But Draghi said: Our December decisions strike a balance between our growing confidence that the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects are firming up, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the same time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lack of a clear sign of sustained convergence of inflation rates towards the desired level. On the one hand, the evidence suggests that the acute deflation risks have disappeared and that inflation is set to pick up over the coming years. And contrary to a widespread perception, euro area economic conditions have also been steadily improving. Euro area GDP growth has been solid in every quarter since the beginning of 2015, averaging 1.9 percent in annualised terms. Compared to 2013, there are 3.5 million fewer unemployed in the euro area, a decrease by more than 18%. And in the last quarter, the recovery has been broadening across sectors and across countries. Indeed, the dispersion of value added growth across euro area countries and sectors has declined sharply and stands close to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. But support from our monetary policy measures is still needed if inflation rates are to converge towards our objective with sufficient confidence and in a sustained manner. The pickup in headline inflation in December and in January largely reflects sizeable upward base effects and recent increases in energy prices. So far underlying inflation pressures remain very subdued and are expected to pick up only gradually as we go on. This lack of momentum in underlying inflation reflects largely weak domestic cost pressures. The still significant degree of labour market slack and weak productivity developments are weighing down on wage growth. As I have argued before, our monetary policy strategy prescribes that we should not react to individual data points and short-lived increases in inflation. Our relevant policy horizon is the medium term. We therefore continue to look through changes in HICP {headline] inflation if we believe they do not durably affect the medium-term outlook for price stability. He added: Looking ahead, risks to the euro area outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. Our current monetary policy stance foresees that, if the inflation outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council is prepared to increase the asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. As European Bank president Mario Draghi appears before the European parliament, his speech has been released here. Time for a quick recap. More than half of UK business leaders have reported that Brexit is already hurting their businesses, even before article 50 is triggered. IPSOS Mori found that 58% of top executives at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies have experienced a negative impact, with most 65% expecting things to be worse in five years. Ben Page, CEO of Ipsos MORI, says: Unfortunately, it looks like business in this country is already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU, with 58% of Captains of Industry stating that their business has suffered negatively since the referendum. According to respondents there is no sign that this is likely to ease this year, with two thirds saying they thought their business situation would get worse in the next 12 months. More encouragingly, almost all business leaders are confident they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll adapt to Brexit. Here are the key slides: In a Monday morning blizzard of Brexit-related news, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also learned that Many companies are planning to raise their prices this year Analysts at Hermes believe a good deal can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be achieved in two years Consultancy firm Mercer fears Britain faces a shortage of skilled labour Labour MP Hilary Benn has warned that government attacks on foreign workers are hurting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image Brits abroad will be hit by mobile roaming charges after Brexit Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits are being hit by the weak pound But UK car sales kept climbing in January And in Europe: German factory orders jumped at the fastest rate since mid-2014 in December. Economists say the figures suggest Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy began 2017 in good shape. But French government bonds are weakening, as the presidential election approaches. Firms are right to worry that the Brexit vote will hurt their businesses over the next couple of years, argues Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, a wealth manager. He says: Though it is a little disheartening, the reality is that Brexit is already having a filtered down effect on the UK market. While we are yet to receive clarity on the long term effect, businesses appear worried about the changing landscape ahead primarily on concerns over access to skilled labour and the single market. The weakening pound has benefited British exports and the stocks of those companies where exports are significant part of earnings. However, the other side of this is costlier imports and therefore higher inflationary pressures, businesses and consumers will have a tough time finding common ground until further clarity emerges on the market dynamics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The possibility of a Brexit or Trump-style shock in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential elections this spring are reverberating through the financial markets today. Investors are selling French government debt, and seeking safety in German bonds instead. The moves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t massive -- French 10-year borrowing costs are up from 1.08% to 1.12%, while the German equivalent is down from 0.41% to 0.38%. But that widens the gap between Berlin and Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs to the widest level in almost four years, and means investors see French debt as riskier. The moves come after Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front party, launched her presidential bid with promises to leave the eurozone, tax imports, raise benefits and enforce a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153French first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy on jobs and social housing. The polls currently suggest Le Pen might win the first round of voting, before being defeated by in the head-to-head second round (most likely by centrist Emmanuel Macron, who also held a rally over the weekend). Back to Hilary Benn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit discussion....where the Labour MP criticised government ministers for undermining the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing through their divisive rhetoric. My colleague Rajeev Syal reports that Benn singled out comments on overseas students and doctors: The former shadow foreign secretary said the Conservative party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because senior politicians portrayed an image of the UK that was insular and aggressive towards foreigners. Indicating that such language could influence negotiations with the EU, Benn said making pronouncements about what the government would achieve from its discussions would harden attitudes towards the UK among European politicians and officials. Speaking at the Institute for Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in central London, Benn said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I reflect upon a certain week in Birmingham in the autumn, where people of a particular political party gathered and made speeches, I thought that was a disastrous week for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation in the world. Absolutely disastrous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: I mentioned earlier that many UK business leaders see securing a free trade deal with Europe as a top priority. The best option might be a deal that gives Britain tariff-free access to the customs union, but not full membership, argues Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes Investment Management. He writes: Turkey and Canada have enjoyed customs-union access with the EU without membership. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in 2016 came after seven years of negotiation. And, needing sign-off by all EU states, it was stalled by the Belgian region of Wallonia! Chancellor Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat that without access, much lower UK corporate tax rates will be needed to maintain FDI and competitiveness (which risks a European \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchase to the bottom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) looks an early stick to achieving similar privileges. But getting such a deal within two years -- the window created by Article 50 -- will be very tough, Williams adds: First, the deal when struck will need Parliamentary approval, and then be subject to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphasing in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 period (Mr Hammond has suggested two years) to allow firms, consumers and officials to adjust to the new arrangements. A second independence referendum in pro-EU Scotland, though not precluding Brexit, could also provide an extra hurdle to completing it before the General Election scheduled for May 2020. Second, the UK is relying on a cooperative sign-off by its 27 EU peers. The only real precedent we have is Greenland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit in 1985. This was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit, but it took three years. We, larger and 44 years entwined in the EU, will need longer. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re opening the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrapdoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a highly-charged political year. Voters facing national elections in Germany, France, The Netherlands and probably Italy may want to approach it as protest to six years of euro-zone austerity. In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperipheral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economies, reform fatigue and populist parties are building. Therefore, incumbents may be reluctant to condone an easy UK exit that puts its economy ahead of their own. UK MPs will get down to the nitty-gritty of Brexit today, as they debate the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill allowing ministers to trigger article 50. Our political correspondent Peter Walker explains: This is the period when amendments are debated, and there are many dozens of them tabled. Today is more focused on amendments connected to process, with the more fundamental ones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably on the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and whether parliament gets a final say over the eventual Brexit deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coming tomorrow. But today should see signs of whether any Conservative MPs are mustering a rebellion on either of those issues, especially now the government has indicated it is not minded to back down unilaterally. Peter is tracking all the action in Politics Live: Meanwhile, the government is taking a tough line on any attempts to derail Brexit.... The 5.2% surge in German factory orders in December shows that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy entered this year in good spirits, argues Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: This underlines that domestic demand in Germany and the Eurozone as a whole looks considerably more robust than many forecasters are assuming, and with such solid momentum going into Q1, the consensus 1.4% y/y forecast for 2017 German GDP looks to be under-clubbed, 1.7%/1.8% looks more likely and 2.0% is a distinct possibility. That would be good news for UK exporters too, as Germany is the second largest export market for British firms (after the US). The slide in the pound since the Brexit vote has been a blow to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beer industry. Craft brewers, for example, are worried that imported hops and malt will simply be too expensive, while some big brewers have been hiking prices. Now Camra, which represents beer lovers, is pushing the government to cut the duty on a pint; 1p may not make a big difference, though. More here: A leaked report has shown that Britons won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from a new clampdown on mobile phone roaming costs within the EU once Brexit has been implemented. Our Brussels bureau chief Daniel Boffey explains: British tourists will have to pay mobile phone operators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 roaming charges when they travel in the EU after Brexit, according to the European parliament committee that helped pioneer the legislation. Despite a ban on the practice, holidaymakers and business travellers will face hefty bills if they use their phone within the EU from 2019, unless the British government strikes a favourable deal with the union. Last week the European commission announced that, from June this year, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumers will be able to call, send SMS or surf on their mobile at the same price they pay at home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when travelling in the EU. The move, which has been years in the making, would significantly reduce travel costs. However, a leaked analysis on UK withdrawal from the EU confirmed this would not apply to Britons post-Brexit.... More here: Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit select committee, has been discussing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit for the EU at an event organised by the Institute for Government. Sophie Gaston of Demos has been tweeting: Lucy Campbell of the IFG is also there: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer any obvious Brexit impact last month, but a slowdown may be coming. Car sales jumped 2.9% year-on-year in January to 174,564, the best performance in any January since 2005. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also reports that electric car sales were particularly strong during the month. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says: After record growth in 2016, some cooling is anticipated over the coming months, but provided interest rates remain low and the economy stable, the market is in a good position to withstand its short-term challenges.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight fears a difficult year for the industry -- with the cost of imported cars likely to rise. Consumers seem certain to find their purchasing power being increasingly diluted during 2017. Furthermore, a likely weakening economy and more uncertain outlook may well make businesses more circumspect in their car purchases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps taking longer to replace fleets. Meanwhile, the sharp weakening of the pound makes it more difficult for car dealers to offer attractive deals on imported cars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the result that some car manufacturers have raised prices and more increases seem inevitable during 2017 . Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary was one of the loudest business voices backing the Remain campaign (in vain) last year. And today, the boss of Ryanair has blamed the impact of the Brexit vote for a 17% tumble in average fares in the last quarter of 2016. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sharp decline in Sterling following the Brexit vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had eaten into profit margins, eroding the benefits of a 16% rise in customers. The airline is also fears disruption as the Brexit negotiations unfold, telling the City that: While it appears that we are heading for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit, there is still significant uncertainty in relation to what exactly this will entail. This uncertainty will continue to represent a challenge for our business for the remainder of the 2017 financial year, and 2018. We expect Sterling to remain volatile for some time and we may see a slowdown in economic growth in both the UK and Europe as we move closer to Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey showing that more than half UK firms are suffering from the Brexit vote, from Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take: More than half of British business leaders believe the vote to leave the European Union has had a negative impact on their companies but most firms are confident they can survive the change, according to a survey on Monday. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has performed more strongly than expected since the Brexit vote last June, but an Ipsos Mori survey of more than 100 of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 500 firms found that 58 percent felt the vote to leave had taken a toll. Management consultancy firm Bain and Company has put out an interesting report on Brexit today. It predicts that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pharmaceutical and aerospace sectors could get a \u00c2\u00a3200m boost from leaving the EU, as WTO rules protect them from tariffs. That would allow them to get the benefit of the weak pound, without also suffering new export penalties. However... Bain also warns that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could cut the profits of UK manufacturers by 30%. Bain partner Michael Garstka is on Bloomberg TV now, explaining that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU will cause significant disruption. Supply chains between Britain, Europe and the US have been built around a certain set of rules for the last 40 years; that is now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup in the air\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. Brexit, whether hard or soft, will have a significant effect on supply chain decisions, Garstka warns. UK firms could struggle to find enough skilled workers after Brexit, according to a report from consultancy firm Mercer. It has found that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working population will grow slowly from 2020, or even contract, due to the ageing population and the prospect of fewer migrants entering the UK. Mercer has modelled several scenarios, depending whether the UK cuts net migration to 100,000 per year, 40,000 year, or an actual an outflow of EU-born and Non-EU born workers caused by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an unwelcome social environment in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The base case scenario is that net migration will fall from 335,000 per year to 185,000 from 2020, as the government forecasts. Even that would create a growing divide between the population total (in green, above) and the number of workers (in blue): Gary Simmons, partner at Mercer, says businesses need to wake up to looming labour shortages now -- by doing more to help people into work, and considering whether some tasks can be automated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both the government and businesses have a Herculean task ahead of them in determining how we respond to the changing shape of our society. We hope that our modelling is a wake-up call to the business community. There is a tremendous opportunity for far-sighted organisations to begin determining and implementing clear plans in response. If they do not act now, they could potentially find they do not have their share of the people and skills they need in future. The solution lies in analysis, automation and accessibility. Companies should analyse and understand the make-up of their workforce. They should look to increase retention of current staff and be accessible: employing sectors of UK society that might be under-represented in the workforce - women, disabled, the long-term unemployed. They should also be investing heavily in automation where possible as well as improving employee productivity, through training and skills.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of Brexit damage in the latest manufacturing figures from Germany. German factory orders, released this morning, have smashed forecasts by growing by a whopping 5.2% in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best result since July 2014, and crushing the 0.5% expected by economists. The economy ministry reports that domestic orders jumped by 6.7% during the month, while foreign orders rallied by 3.9%. Demand from eurozone countries was particularly robust, soaring by 10%. However..November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures have been revised down to a 3.6% fall, from 2.5% previously. The Brexit vote is also going to drive up prices in the shops this year. A majority of firms surveyed by the British Chambers of Commerce are planning to hike prices in 2017, due to the slump in the pound last year. The survey also punctures the idea that weaker sterling is a pure boost to exporters; instead, many are also having to pay higher prices for raw materials from abroad. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The depreciation of Sterling in recent months has been the main tangible impact that firms have had to grapple with since the EU referendum vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our research shows that the falling pound has been a double-edged sword for many UK businesses. Nearly as many exporters say the low pound is damaging them as benefiting them. For firms that import, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now more expensive, and companies may find themselves locked into contracts with suppliers and unable to be responsive to currency fluctuations. More than half of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies are now suffering from the public vote to leave the European Union last June. A new survey of business leaders found that 58% said the Brexit vote was already having a negative impact on their firm. Just 11% said it had helped business. And stormclouds also appear to be gathering over the economy, with two-third of corporate chiefs leaders predicting that their business situation will be more negative once Britain leaves the EU. In the long term.... 32% predict a positive impact on their business in five years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time and 45% expected to feel a negative impact. The survey was conducted by Ipsos Mori, who polled 114 chairmen, CEOs, managing directors and finance chiefs from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest 500 firms Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos Mori, says that the survey shows that businesses are already feeling the pain of the economic upheaval of leaving the EU,. Page added: According to respondents there is no sign that this is likely to ease this year, with two thirds saying they thought their business situation would get worse in the next 12 months. The survey also found that business leaders are particularly worried about losing access to skilled workers. Asked what Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priorities should be in the Brexit negotiations, the business chiefs said: Movement/access of skilled labour (54%), securing free trade/single market (47%), passporting rights (16%), controlled/clarity on immigration (13%), continuing being a trading partner with Europe (9%), tariff agreement (9%) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week kicks off with lots of economic data, two important UK select committee hearings, and the prospect of more drama in Europe. On the data front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re finding out how German manufacturers and UK car sellers fared last month, and getting a gauge on investor confidence across the region: 07:00 GMT German Factory Orders 9am GMT: New UK Car Registrations 9:30am GMT: Euro-Zone Sentix Investor Confidence Over in parliament, MPs on the Work and Pensions committee are holding a hearing into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gig economy, from 3.45pm. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from seven workers, including a Hermes driver who lost work after seeking time off to take his terminally ill wife to hospital. Committee chairman Frank Field tells us the seven workers are all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly brave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given some still work for the likes of Uber, Deliveroo and Hermes. Down the corridor, the Transport select committee will be investigating problems with Vauxhall Zafira cars, which have a nasty habit of overheating and catching fire. According to the Daily Telegraph, Vauxhall executives will face a grilling (not literally, we trust) over the problems. On the eurozone front, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi testifying in Brussels from 2pm GMT. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to face calls from German MEPs to slow his stimulus programme, now that inflation is finally headint upwards. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also have an eye on the eurozone, where Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout talks are still deadlocked and France is rattling towards its presidential elections.",

In recent months as the rhetoric has crescendoed it is a claim that has been openly used to account for the foot dragging in implementation of reforms. Now that a split within the IMF itself has also come to light, cadres in the ruling Syriza party are saying it will only strengthen the leftist-led coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to stick to its guns and not forge ahead with more painful austerity. The government spokesman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description of IMF demands as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illogical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is indicative, they say, of Athens now digging in. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a lot of behind-the-scenes movement to see where the points of convergence are,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But to ask us to strangle our economy further and take additional measures once the bailout ends when our [economic] progress has been openly acknowledged is totally absurd.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Euro working group will be seminal in seeing if a solution can be found to break the deadlock and conclude the review by February 20 when euro area finance ministers next meet in eurogroup session. Creditors are now saying it is up to the Greek finance ministry to take the initiative with announcement of new reforms, not least further broadening of the personal income tax base by lowering the tax threshold to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a measure that would bring around 1.5 million Greeks currently surviving on very low wages and pensions into the tax fold. Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, has opposed the measure amid widespread rumour that he will hand in his resignation if forced to rescind. The circular nature of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis is such that even with borrowing costs rocketing and yields on ten-year bonds soaring, the government is still confident that a compromise formula will be found with several leading figures repeating prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conviction that the review will wrap up sooner rather than later with the IMF ultimately remaining in the programme even if only in an advisory role. UK markets have closed higher, helped by the weakness in the pound, with the FTSE 100 up 0.2% and the FTSE 250 closing at a new high, of 18,559, up 0.99%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets are back on the rise, with the FTSE benefitting from a weaker pound, and US markets reaching record highs despite a widening trade deficit. The FTSE is enjoying a strong recovery today, with the deterioration in the pound helping to boost the index. Once more it is the gold producers heading up the leaderboard, with Randgold and Fresnillo rallying sharply despite today representing an off day for the gold price. Despite the weakness we saw earlier in the week, it is clear that investors see any pullback as an opportunity to get into the Trump rally, with the Dow and Nasdaq hitting a fresh all-time intraday high in early trading. The pound remained subdued against a resurgent dollar today, despite BoE member Forbes speculating that the MPC should seek to raise rates even with the Brexit uncertainty. Improved inflation data across the world has raised suspicions that we could see the likes of the ECB and BoE tout a more hawkish tone. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments stand in stark contrast to the accommodative stance preferred across Europe as a means to ward against any adverse economic effects of the Brexit process. The bank could end up choosing between respecting its price stability mandate or providing a supportive policy framework for a downturn that may never come. The worries about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt problems following the signs of a split among the IMF board members continues to hit the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds. Yields on its 10 year bonds are at 7.8% while the two year yield is at 10%: The pound is still lower against a strong dollar - the US currency being boosted by Fed comments suggesting a rate hike before long - but it is well off its lowest levels. Sterling has recovered some lost ground after the news of a vote on a Brexit deal in parliament, as well as the comments from Bank of England policymaker Kirstin Forbes that UK rates may soon need to rise. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: As the Brexit debate rages on, news that MPs will get a vote on a deal, before the European parliament and covering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot only the withdrawal arrangements but also the future relationship with the European Union took the edge off the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline as the afternoon went on. Sterling was also helped by comments from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kristin Forbes, who stated that she believes a rate hike might be need to prevent inflation from getting too unwieldy. This could only erase a small part of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, however, with sterling still down 0.7% against the dollar. The euro, meanwhile, maintained its half a percent drop against the greenback, spooked by both Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-stimulus comments yesterday and the truly terrifying prospect of President Marine Le Pen. The Le Pen issue meant that, while the FTSE and DAX rose 0.6% and 0.4% respectively, the CAC slipped by 0.4%, the French index finding itself back under 4800 once again. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 is heading towards a new peak. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After weak start European stock markets are slightly more buoyant today, helped in part by a weaker euro and a weaker pound, helping push the DAX and FTSE100 higher on the day, with the FTSE 100 hitting a two week high and the FTSE 250 set to post a new record close, begging the question, are UK stocks becoming a safe haven for European political risk? Back with Greece, and the country is doing better than the IMF suggests. That is the view of Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who said the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report was outdated due to recent Greek growth, and he was surprised by the harshness of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. He said that there had been some easing of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt but more was needed. But he saw no forgiveness of Greek debt, only the possibility of easier repayment terms. Over on Wall Street, and US markets are on the rise again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new record of 20,126, up 74 points, while the Nasdaq Composite is also in uncharted territory again. Investors have been encouraged by the trade deficit in December coming in better than expected, ignoring a fall in fourth quarter income at General Motors. Over in the UK parliament, a concession from the government: Brexit minister David Jones has announced that MPs will get a vote on the final deal to leave the EU before it is concluded. More at our politics live blog here. The comments about a possible rise in interest rates from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirstin Forbes has given some support to the pound. It has erased some of its losses against the dollar, and is now down 0.67% at $1.2386 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2348 this morning. And against the euro, sterling has now edged up 0.02% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1597 after dropping to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1576. Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes has suggested she is getting closer to voting for a rate rise to stop inflation rising too high. In a speech in Leeds, she is saying the economy had outperformed gloomy post-referendum expectations and continued to hold up well. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key comment from Forbes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the real economy remains solid and the pickup in the nominal data continues, this could soon suggest an increase in Bank Rate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is worth highlighting that an increase in interest rates, however, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely low level of Bank Rate, and the substantial amount of monetary stimulus that is already in place through a variety of programs, would still leave a substantial amount of monetary support for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forbes had also become the latest economist to raise the question of whether her profession might have been smarter not to factor in any leave vote impact at all for the UK economy in 2016. Forbes notes how much actual developments in the second half of 2016 matched the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts made in May last year on the basis on a remain vote. Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments come after her colleague on the committee, Andy Haldane, said last month that it was fair to describe economics as being in crisis given a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash. He described the collapse of Lehman Brothers as the economics profession\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Michael Fish moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - a reference to when the BBC weather forecaster predicted in 1987 that the UK would avoid a hurricane that went on to devastate large parts of southern England. Forbes said in her speech in Leeds - where she is talking about the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest outlook in the inflation report - that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is certainly fodder for criticism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vast majority of economists and forecasters expected the UK economy to slow immediately after the UK voted to leave the European Union, with some even predicting an outright recession. Most put substantial weight on the evidence that growth, and especially investment, tends to slow sharply in the face of heightened uncertainty. I was on the more optimistic end of the forecasters, but I still expected to see at least some softening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But this slowdown has not occurred - and it has now been over 7 months since the June vote...Growth may still slow as higher inflation reduces real incomes, or if negative supply effects related to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union build over time. Signs of such a slowdown starting soon, however, are as yet few and far between.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she, like several City economists of late, was quick to point out that the forecasts made for the UK voting to stay in the EU had turned out to be close to the mark. Referring to Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Fish remark, Forbes said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You may have heard that UK economic forecasters have recently been less accurate than weathermen. But I will show you that the Bank of England has actually done quite well - that is, if you compare the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent performance to what was predicted in May based on the assumption that the UK would vote to remain in the European Union... ... The bottom line: the real economy, including the labour market, have performed largely as forecast last spring. Most economic measures (except investment) have matched or slightly outperformed our May expectations based on a Remain vote. The UK economy appears to have been largely resilient to Brexit uncertainty. The main exception is sterling and the nominal data - which indicate sharply higher inflation than expected last spring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As for why the economy had proved so resilient to the vote, Forbes listed several possible factors and said the UK had benefited from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Series of Fortunate Events\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the second half of 2016. Supporting factors included Bank of England action after the vote, including a rate cut, the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation, a stronger global economy, a higher minimum wage and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less negative effects of heightened uncertainty than expected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Talking about the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for growth to be 2% this year but slow next year, for inflation to rise and for unemployment to edge up, Forbes said for her the key risks to that view were: how sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation affects inflation dynamics, how wages evolve, and how consumersrespond to slower real income growth. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever points out that US trade deficit actually narrowed last year, as a proportion of the economy - and despite a strengthening dollar. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to the US trade data (no word from the president yet, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid...) Donald Trump has made trade a massive issue, so the latest US trade figures are going to be particularly closely watched. And the headline news is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world has hit a four-year high in 2016, at $502.3bn, up from $500.4bn in 2015. That included a $347bn trade deficit with China, and a $146bn deficit with the European Union. But... the figures also show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in December, to $44.3bn, thanks to a rise in exports. With the euro still wallowing below $1.07, analysts are blaming political uncertainty in Europe. Analysts at Rabobank say the French presidential election is to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although opinion polls suggest that (Far-right National Front Leader Marine) Le Pen will not win the second round of the French presidential election in May, polls have wrongly picked the winners of both socialist and republican primaries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish comments from ECB president Draghi aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping the euro either. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday about the need for stimulus in the Eurozone despite rising inflation, alongside the damage the currency would suffer if Marine Le Pen becomes the next French president, are dragging it lower. Overall if seems that the pound is struggling the most, however, dipping by 0.2% against the euro having been 0.3% up just after the bell. One point... Although the rise in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yields is significant, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually affect its borrowing costs yet (because the country is in a bailout programme). As Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts reminds me... the short-dated two-year Treasury bonds are a better measure of the current borrowing costs (They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spiked even more sharply, to around 10%) Ten-year bond yields show how much confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has in a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term credit-worthiness. If investors are demanding much higher yields to hold the debt (yields rise when prices fall), then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more worried. Athens-based journalist Omaira Gill tweets: The Greek government has now weighed in on the ongoing row over its bailout. Spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said the government hopes for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpositive conclusion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the long-running (and bogged down) review of the programme. He also insisted that Athens will not swallow additional austerity measures, and still hopes to be included in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme soon. Tzanakopoulos says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is aspiring for a deal that will lead to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion in the (ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) quantitative easing programme. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is clear and it has been expressed categorically ... our aim is to not yield to illogical demands by the International Monetary Fund, which insists on legislating precautionary (austerity) measures after the programme ends.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK Treasury has responded to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax burden will soon hit a three-decade high: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all. That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As former Treasury head honcho Rupert Harrison points out, this means even more austerity.... Back to Greece...and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark borrowing costs have spiked to their highest level of this year. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year bonds has jumped to 8% this morning - after the IMF revealed its board is split over how much austerity the country should swallow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since last October, and puts Greek debt firmly in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdanger zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated warnings that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden is unsustainable, and its persistent reluctance to join the latest bailout, is worrying investors. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, has a good take: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European debt crisis never went away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a fix was implemented and the can was kicked down the road but the problem came back in 2016, particularly in the case of Italy and Greece In the meantime, the fractures in these and other countries have grown as the economies have shrunk or barely grown with the growth of extremist, protectionist parties which are a threat to the liberal values. 2017 has a number of elections including in France, Netherlands and Germany which represent significant risks for the Eurozone. . In particular Greece is renegotiating its bailout at a time when the economy continues to struggle and living standards have plummeted and the country is in the frontline of a migration crisis. The Troika of Greek Creditors, the IMF, EU and ECB face a very difficult situation. They do not want to write off but Greece is in no position to pay. There is a rift even within the IMF about fiscal targets set for Greece. Some within the IMF have called them unsustainable, seriously questioning the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to generate and sustain a surplus and long term growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year bonds are also spiralling higher this morning, showing renewed concerns over its bailout. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the IFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim assessment of the UK economy: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax burden is set to hit its highest level in three decades, to help fix the black hole in the UK public finances That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has just published its new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreen budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax take is on track to hit 37% of national income by 2019-2020, a level not seen since 1986. Paul Johnson, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, gives a very gloomy assessment of the UK economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For all the focus on Brexit the public finances in the next few years look set to be defined by the spending cuts announced by George Osborne. Cuts to day-to-day public service spending are due to accelerate while the tax burden continues to rise. Even so the new chancellor may not find it all that easy to meet his target of eliminating the budget deficit in the next parliament. Even on central forecasts that is going to require extending austerity towards the mid-2020s. If the economy does less well than hoped then we may see yet another set of fiscal rules consigned to the dustbin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: In yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, we reported how British businesses are already suffering a negative impact from the Brexit vote. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news is more encouraging -- the UK could be the fastest growing economy between now and 2050, according to new research from PwC. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- Britain needs to secure successful trade deals to ease the disruption from Brexit, and keep pace with fast-growing developing markets. My colleague Katie Allen explains: PwC sets out the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects in its latest report into how the world economy will look in 2050. Using models that analyse population trends, investment, education and technological progress, PwC economists expect six of the seven largest economies by 2050 will be emerging markets, led by China. They see the UK economy remaining in the top 10, slipping down one spot from ninth place now to 10th in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, which adjusts for price differences between countries to provide a measure of the volume of goods and services produced by an economy. France is forecast to drop out of the top 10, to 12th place in 2050, while Germanyis forecast to fall from fifth place to ninth. Mexico is the only newcomer to the top 10 in 2050. More details of the report are here. French bonds are coming under more pressure this morning too. This selloff has pushed the gap between Paris and Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respective borrowing costs to a four-year high. The cost of insuring French bonds against default is also rising; traders have heard Marine Le Pen pledge to take the country out of the euro. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, expects political worries to gnaw at the euro over the next few months. We expect the euro/US dollar exchange rate to reach the low for the year sometime in the next three months, during the French political election campaign, at a level close to parity. If Marine Le Pen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win the election, we expect a very significant Euro rebound through the second half of 2017 as valuations and capital flows dominate. But with M Fillon showing no signs of leaving the fray, M Bayrou still lurking in the shadows, and M Hamon still making overtures to M Melenchon, the only candidate confident of making it to the second round is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US dollar is enjoying a little surge this morning, sending the pound and euro reeling in its wake. Sterling has dropped almost a whole cent to $1.237, a two-week low. The euro is also taking a bath, down 0.7% at $1.067. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has a theory: Traders in the City seem to have woken up to the prospect of the Fed tightening interest rates quicker than they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d thought, after Philly Fed president Patrick Harker said he would support hiking rates in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thrown the cat among the doves a bit as the last FOMC meeting suggested the Fed was not likely to raise rates until the summer. The rally in safe haven assets seems to have stalled and traders are piling back into long dollar positions. Dublin MEP Nessa Childers is pleased that most IMF board members believe Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets should be cut, to just 1.5 % of GDP. Newsflash: UK house prices fell (yes, fell) by 0.9% month-on-month in January, according to new figures from the Halifax. Economists had expected prices to remain flat. On an annual basis, prices were 5.9% higher, with the average house costing just over \u00c2\u00a3220,000. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government debt is falling in value this morning. The yield, or interest rates, on 10-year Greek bonds has jumped to 8%, from 7.85% last night. That means its price has fallen, with investors calculating that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a greater risk that Athens defaults. Short-term Greek debt is also under real pressure, sending yields spiking higher: The divisions among the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout highlight its long-running row with Europe, points out the Financial Times: The fund did not reveal which board members had objected. But the public statement illustrates the sensitivity surrounding the continuing Greek bailout programme. It also points to one of the main political challenges facing Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director who has battled with European leaders over the Greek debt issue for almost two years. The IMF has been the target of criticism since first joining the EU-led bailout of Greece in 2010, particularly over the strict fiscal targets it set early on. Economists have also blamed the IMF and its European partners for not doing enough to reduce Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term debt load. But the IMF has for the past two years insisted that Germany and other eurozone members needed to do more to tackle that debt. By labelling Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt unsustainable it has also made its own financial contribution to a bailout impossible under its own rules unless Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt is either restructured or forgiven in part. The IMF has also made its traditional call for Greece to receive fresh debt relief. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: Most Directors considered that, despite Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous sacrifices and European partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 generous support, further relief may well be required to restore debt sustainability. They stressed the need to calibrate such relief on realistic assumptions about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to generate sustained surpluses and long term growth. Directors underlined, however, that debt relief needs to be complemented with strong policy implementation to restore growth and sustainability. A split has opened up at the International Monetary Fund over the terms of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, raising new doubts over its participation in the rescue plan. In its latest annual review of the Greek economy, the IMF revealed that its board members are in disagreement over whether Athens should enforce even more austerity to satisfy its lenders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the 24-strong group agreed that Greece was on track to achieve a surplus of 1.5% of GDP, and should not make further cuts. However, another group on the board argued that Athens needed to tighten further to push its surplus up to 3.5% of GDP, the level agreed in its last bailout. In a rare statement, the IMF says that: Most Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal while some Directors had different views on the fiscal path and debt sustainability..... Most Directors agreed that Greece does not require further fiscal consolidation at this time, given the impressive adjustment to date which is expected to bring the medium-term primary fiscal surplus to around 1\u00c2\u00bd percent of GDP, while some Directors favored a surplus of 3\u00c2\u00bd percent of GDP by 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation, and Discusses Ex Post Evaluation of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2012 Extended Fund Facility IMF board meetings are usually kept confidential, so we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally know whether decisions are unanimous or not. The unusual decision to reveal the split highlights the divisions over Greece within the IMF, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t joined the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout, agreed in August 2015. Last month, a leaked report showed that the IMF believes Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile is on track to swell to almost 300% of GDP by 2060 -- a profoundly unsustainable level. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political tensions are rising in Europe, and exerting pressure on the financial markets. The possibility of a far-right win in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election this spring has pushed French bonds to their weakest level in 18 months, widening the gap with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Germany. If the eurozone was totally secure, French debt would be as safe as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - but right now, investors seem anxious. An opinion poll showing that Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU party had fallen to second place, behind the Social Democrats, has also caused jitters. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: European markets got off to a poor start to the week yesterday, slipping to seven week lows, with investors once again reluctant to try their luck against a backdrop of rising political risk, on both sides of the Atlantic. While US President Trump has extended his one man crusade to the US court system, after his travel ban was overturned, any notion of a more stable political outlook in Europe took another twist over the weekend, as a narrowing of opinion polls in Germany, cast doubt on Angela Merkel remaining as Chancellor later this year, while Marine Le Pen launched her bid for the French Presidency as well. In the UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies will publish its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreen Budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, outlining the challenges facing chancellor Philip Hammond as he draws up new tax and spending plans (the real budget is on 8th March). The Halifax building society is releasing its latest house price figure at 8.30am GMT. On the corporate front, oil giant BP, travel firm FirstGroup and model maker Hornby are reporting results.",

Ironically last week Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade advisor accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, when it is the ECB which sets rates and implements the very programmes the country is unhappy about.</p> <p>Now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/german-push-for-g-20-monetary-policy-restraint-said-to-stumble-iyx03z25\">a Bloomberg report says that Germany tried and failed to get the G20 to intervene in the current situation</a>. It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Germany has abandoned a renewed effort to push the Group of 20 to rein in monetary stimulus, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>German officials failed to convince counterparts that the G-20 should support language backing tighter monetary policy to promote global financial resilience, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are private. Germany had drafted it in a document as part of its presidency of the group this year, and will host finance chiefs next month in the spa town of Baden-Baden. </p> <p>The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy initiative was thwarted even before a transatlantic spat erupted last week after the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top trade adviser criticized Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged currency policy. That episode hints at the challenges for its G-20 presidency in a politically volatile year as U.S. President Donald Trump hits out against global finance and trade rules, the U.K. plans its departure from the European Union, and Germany and France face elections. </p> <p>...Officials have tried in vain for years to convince counterparts to include language in their statements that would hint at a preference for tighter monetary policy, citing low interest rates as an impediment to growth by hurting savers and bank balance sheets, according to a person involved in past discussions.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Reuters is quoting a German finance ministry spokeswoman denying that the country had pushed for tighter monetary policy and repeated that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respected the independence of central banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-589b4534e4b08bb4fbbe9fbe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-08T16:23:28.788Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Stock markets are struggling for direction as investors try to take in the various global risks souring sentiment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, reckons worse could be on the way for share prices. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a clear sign that things are not well within markets when Rio Tinto announces excellent numbers and a tasty dividend, but the shares fall.</p> <p>Risk appetite, despite the best efforts of investors earlier in the week, has been on the wane, and from the reaction to Rio it seems that we could be on the cusp of a bigger drop.</p> <p>While the Dow continues to hold 20,000, its position above this looks increasingly tenuous. The ominous quiet in US markets, where moves greater than 1% continue to be rarer than hens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 teeth, is a signal that something big is on its way. The current flows into gold and treasuries and away from the S&amp;P 500 is another indication that the equity rally is looking exhausted.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-589b3d13e4b08bb4fbbe9f8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-08T15:46:48.494Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the US oil stock numbers, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest update from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed an inventory build of 13.83 million barrels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well above the 2.7 million expected.</p> <p>This confirms the enormous crude inventory rise reported by the American Petroleum Institute after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. This showed a build of 14.27 million barrels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well above the 2.5 million build expected. However, there was little market reaction to the EIA update as it also reported a drawdown in gasoline stocks which helped offset the crude build.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the news is helping to keep a lid on crude prices. At the beginning of the week Brent and WTI were testing resistance at $57 and $54 respectively. Now there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a danger that support around $54 and $51 could be broken. If so, this could see speculative longs rush to cover their positions and drive prices back below $50. Then investors will worry that crude is heading back to $40 rather than the $60 target that they had in mind just two weeks ago. If so, then this could knock the wind out of the equity market rally and spark a rash of profit-taking.</p> </blockquote> <p>Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oil prices have slid quite sharply over the past couple of days. A huge 14.2m build in API inventories would appear to suggest that the potential for further significant gains in the oil price appear limited at this time. US EIA inventories also posted a huge build coming in at 13.83m barrels, well above expectations of 2.5m barrels, however a surprise draw on gasoline inventories, may well limit the downside in the short term.</p> <p>While the antics of OPEC may well have succeeded in driving prices higher they have also given US shale producers the opportunity to ramp up production again, as they bring rigs back on line. The big question now is whether the WTI/Brent spread starts to widen out as US prices look to retest the recent range lows near $50 a barrel. The jump in US rig counts since the beginning of last year has seen a jump from 658 to 729 now, an increase of over 10%.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a152762565dedd659cddd4ec113ed65f6496b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a152762565dedd659cddd4ec113ed65f6496b25/0_382_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US crude stocks rise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US crude stocks rise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-08T15:52:11.566Z\">at 3.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-589b3a0ee4b08bb4fbbe9f7e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-08T15:34:20.247Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US oil stocks surge</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US weekly crude stocks jumped by 13.8m barrels to 508.59m, a huge rise compared to the expected 2.5m gain.</p> <p>But gasoline stocks fell by 869,000 barrels compared to forecasts of a 1.1m barrel increase.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-08T15:36:22.940Z\">at 3.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-589b380ce4b08bb4fbbe9f71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-08T15:25:46.143Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Global markets are in a negative mood, with little impetus to drive them higher.

The UK index dropped by 15 points as the day went on, keeping it trapped below 7200.

Most of the under-investors blamed a lack of bank finance. But they also said they prioritised payments to shareholders over investment, which shows that returning cash to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners takes priority over securing the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future.</em></p> <p><strong>In Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the near term, in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic forecasts published last week, business investment is expected to remain very weak before picking up.

European elections in France and Germany, the renewed emergence of Greece and its debt problems as a headline maker, and the continuing attempts to deal with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unprecedented presidency all combined to make for a cautious day on the markets. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 2.6 points or 0.04% at 7188.82 as a rise in housebuilding shares helped offset falls in commodity companies. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.05% to 11,543.38 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.26% at 4766.60 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.58% to 18,771.78 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9329.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 2.01% to 610.86 as worries about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme re-emerged On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 48 points or 0.24%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. And on Greece, it is the summer which will prove crucial (again): Has Germany been pushing for the G20 to halt the current loose monetary policy - low interest rates and a QE programme of bond buying - adopted by the European Central Bank? It has been known that Germany is unhappy with low - and even negative interest rates - since they disadvantage the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s millions of savers. Ironically last week Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade advisor accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, when it is the ECB which sets rates and implements the very programmes the country is unhappy about. Now a Bloomberg report says that Germany tried and failed to get the G20 to intervene in the current situation. It said: Germany has abandoned a renewed effort to push the Group of 20 to rein in monetary stimulus, according to people familiar with the matter. German officials failed to convince counterparts that the G-20 should support language backing tighter monetary policy to promote global financial resilience, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are private. Germany had drafted it in a document as part of its presidency of the group this year, and will host finance chiefs next month in the spa town of Baden-Baden. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy initiative was thwarted even before a transatlantic spat erupted last week after the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top trade adviser criticized Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged currency policy. That episode hints at the challenges for its G-20 presidency in a politically volatile year as U.S. President Donald Trump hits out against global finance and trade rules, the U.K. plans its departure from the European Union, and Germany and France face elections. ...Officials have tried in vain for years to convince counterparts to include language in their statements that would hint at a preference for tighter monetary policy, citing low interest rates as an impediment to growth by hurting savers and bank balance sheets, according to a person involved in past discussions. But Reuters is quoting a German finance ministry spokeswoman denying that the country had pushed for tighter monetary policy and repeated that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respected the independence of central banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets are struggling for direction as investors try to take in the various global risks souring sentiment. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, reckons worse could be on the way for share prices. He said: It is a clear sign that things are not well within markets when Rio Tinto announces excellent numbers and a tasty dividend, but the shares fall. Risk appetite, despite the best efforts of investors earlier in the week, has been on the wane, and from the reaction to Rio it seems that we could be on the cusp of a bigger drop. While the Dow continues to hold 20,000, its position above this looks increasingly tenuous. The ominous quiet in US markets, where moves greater than 1% continue to be rarer than hens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 teeth, is a signal that something big is on its way. The current flows into gold and treasuries and away from the S&amp;P 500 is another indication that the equity rally is looking exhausted. On the US oil stock numbers, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: The latest update from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed an inventory build of 13.83 million barrels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well above the 2.7 million expected. This confirms the enormous crude inventory rise reported by the American Petroleum Institute after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. This showed a build of 14.27 million barrels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well above the 2.5 million build expected. However, there was little market reaction to the EIA update as it also reported a drawdown in gasoline stocks which helped offset the crude build. Nevertheless, the news is helping to keep a lid on crude prices. At the beginning of the week Brent and WTI were testing resistance at $57 and $54 respectively. Now there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a danger that support around $54 and $51 could be broken. If so, this could see speculative longs rush to cover their positions and drive prices back below $50. Then investors will worry that crude is heading back to $40 rather than the $60 target that they had in mind just two weeks ago. If so, then this could knock the wind out of the equity market rally and spark a rash of profit-taking. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Oil prices have slid quite sharply over the past couple of days. A huge 14.2m build in API inventories would appear to suggest that the potential for further significant gains in the oil price appear limited at this time. US EIA inventories also posted a huge build coming in at 13.83m barrels, well above expectations of 2.5m barrels, however a surprise draw on gasoline inventories, may well limit the downside in the short term. While the antics of OPEC may well have succeeded in driving prices higher they have also given US shale producers the opportunity to ramp up production again, as they bring rigs back on line. The big question now is whether the WTI/Brent spread starts to widen out as US prices look to retest the recent range lows near $50 a barrel. The jump in US rig counts since the beginning of last year has seen a jump from 658 to 729 now, an increase of over 10%. US weekly crude stocks jumped by 13.8m barrels to 508.59m, a huge rise compared to the expected 2.5m gain. But gasoline stocks fell by 869,000 barrels compared to forecasts of a 1.1m barrel increase. Global markets are in a negative mood, with little impetus to drive them higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The respective weaknesses of the dollar, pound and euro cancelled each other out this afternoon, leading to a flat forex market and a splash of red across the Western indices. After a positive start, a lurch into loss-filled territory for the miners, a widening fall for BP and Shell, and a sector-wide slide for the banks helped drag the FTSE lower this afternoon. The UK index dropped by 15 points as the day went on, keeping it trapped below 7200. Things were similar in the Eurozone, where the DAX and CAC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier gains were replaced with a rouged-flatness; the French index saw the most significant change, losing all of the 0.7% growth it had posted during the morning to slip into the red by 0.1%. The change in tone this Wednesday can be in part attributed to the negative start from the Dow Jones. The Dow fell around 40 points after the bell, its financial sector providing most of the downwards drag. The number of Britons seeking Spanish sun jumped the most in a decade to hit a record in 2016. UK tourists visiting Spain jumped by more than 12% to 17.8 million, as security worries put people off from travelling to other destinations such as Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt. The trend looks set to continue according to analysts at GfK, with early bookings for 2017 summer holidays in Spain up 16% compared with last year. The rise comes despite the sharp fall in the value of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote, which means spending money won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go as far on the Continent. Cristobal de la Rosa, vice-councillor of tourism in the Canary Islands, said: We have been very happy with the figures - instead of a fall there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a sharp rise. US markets are down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.3% at 20,038 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,288 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,662 That chart on Greece and the Great Depression again: Joachim Fels, a managing director at Pimco, the global bond investor, believes we have entered a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold currency war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: It can be argued that in this cold currency war there is no balance of power now that the Trump administration has taken office and appears to be much more willing to use the nuclear weapon: protectionism. With the U.S. running a large trade deficit and Europe, China and Japan having large bilateral surpluses with the US, the US stands to lose much less from a trade war, and the public pronouncements by Trump and Navarro suggest that protectionist action is a very credible threat. If so, the rational response by Europe, Japan, China and other exporters would be to not overdo the cold currency war and, at least temporarily, allow some appreciation of their currencies versus the dollar in order not to provoke the US further. The pound is (slightly) up against both the dollar and the euro. It is up 0.1% against both currencies, at $1.2531 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.172. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, has been speaking at the Greater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. Phillip Inman, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics correspondent, gives this analysis: Sir Jon Cunliffe refuses to draw a conclusion from the Bank of England survey of businesses and how they invest. But it appears to show that firms remain reluctant to boost spending while the outlook remains uncertain. Companies are continuing to demand a 12% rate of return on investments, which is an average rate going back 100 years, and traditionally gave a return over interest rates of 7%.Now that interest rates are virtually zero, the headline rate of return remains 12, giving them a 12% return over interest rates. This 5 percentage point gap indicates that firms are wary of the risks and demand a higher real return on their investments. Also, looking at the survey in more detail, two thirds of firms said they had invested appropriately since the financial crash and a third of firms said they had under-invested. Most of the under-investors blamed a lack of bank finance. But they also said they prioritised payments to shareholders over investment, which shows that returning cash to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners takes priority over securing the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. In Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words: In the near term, in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic forecasts published last week, business investment is expected to remain very weak before picking up. This weakness is consistent with survey indicators of investment intentions which remain subdued and elevated uncertainty, as detailed in the February 2017 Inflation Report. Ultimately, the outlook for business investment, like the outlook for the economy more generally over the forecast period, depends largely on how households and businesses react to Brexit and on the process that accompanies it. Traders over at spread betting firm IG are predicting a slow start when US markets open: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets are slightly down this afternoon, with the exception of the CAC in France: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,177 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.1% at 11,540 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% at 4,768 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 18,581 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.04% at 9,328 Michel Barnier, the man who will lead Brexit negotiations for the EU, has reassured Ireland that he will seek to address the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns: The FTSE 250 has hit a new record high, currently up 0.4% at 18,632. Here is how the index of UK-focused firms has performed over the last 20 years: Shares in Athens are down 1.6%, with banks among the biggest fallers. Jennifer McKeown, the chief European economist at Capital Economics, says the risk of Grexit has risen again. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Greek debt sustainability analysis reveals that the fund now sees debt rising even more sharply than it had assumed last year. This further reduces the likelihood that it will contribute to the bailout, increasing the risk that payments will stop and Greece will be forced to default. The IMF has not yet ruled out participating in the bailout, but there is a growing risk that it will do so. Since Greece is reliant on bailout payments to cover its debt redemptions, the risk of default and possible Grexit has risen yet again. A flashpoint will come this summer, when large repayments are due to be made to the ECB and private investors. Ted Malloch, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed US ambassador to the EU, has been ruffling feathers again, predicting that Greece will ask to leave the eurozone. Speaking late last night on Greek chat show Istories, Malloch said it would have probably been better for Greece if it had initiated the process of exiting the EU four years ago, when doing so would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easier and simpler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eight years of punishing austerity had been so bad that it was questionable whether \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what comes next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be worse, he told the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief anchor, Alexis Papahelas, reminding viewers that Trump had tweeted that Greeks were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasting their time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the eurozone. I think we have to face some facts. The first one is that the harsh austerity programs have been a complete failure. I have traveled to Greece, met lots of Greek people, I have academic friends in Greece, and they say that these austerity plans are really deeply hurting the Greek people and that the situation is simply unsustainable. So you might have to ask the question if what comes next could possibly be worse than what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Malloch said the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future would be determined over the next 18 months. Certainly there will be a Europe, whether the eurozone survives, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very much a question that is on the agenda. We have had the exit of the UK, there are elections in other European countries, so I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that will be determined over the course of the next year, year-and-a-half. I think it is interesting from the perspective of Greece. Why is Greece again on the brink: it seems like a deja vu, will it ever end? I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that Greece itself will break out of the euro. Tom Rogers from Oxford Economics is warning that consumers from around the world will have to tighten their belts after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a few years of plenty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The combination of higher inflation, rising debt servicing costs and a slowdown in job creation across the globe is curbing global spending power, which will grow at the weakest rate in eight years in 2017, our index of household resources shows. The good news is that spending power at the global level will rebound in 2018, with growth in line with the average from 2014 to 2016. Here is a summary of some of the other main points from the Bank of England agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report: Consumer spending growth has been resilient, but is expected to ease this year as prices rise Companies are facing greater price pressures following the drop in the value of the pound (which makes imports more expensive) So far, consumers have only really been affected by higher food and fuel prices, but rises are expected on a wider range of goods over the coming year Sticking with the UK, the Bank of England has published its latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcagents summary of business conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report. The Bank has 12 regional agents who visit about 700 businesses across the UK and report back to Threadneedle Street on the latest conditions. In a blow to UK workers, agents reported that companies are expecting to hand out smaller pay rises this year. Labour costs are expected to rise, partly because of increases in pension contributions, and the apprenticeship levy. Some of the factors expected to push up total labour costs growth would be unlikely to be reflected in higher pay settlements. The average pay settlement was expected to ease in 2017 to 2.2% from 2.7% in 2016, with the number of pay awards between 3% and 4% expected to fall significantly. Settlements were expected to moderate in all sectors, with the largest decline anticipated in consumer services, where some companies had made pay awards in 2016 that were beyond those strictly necessary to meet the National Living Wage at that time. Today is the final day of Commons debate on the article 50 bill. Here is the rough timetable, taken from our politics live blog with Andrew Sparrow. MPs begin the final day of debate on the article 50 bill. At around 5.40pm there will be the final set of votes on amendments, including on the call for EU nationals living in the UK to have their right to stay guaranteed now. Then the bill will get its third reading, with the vote by about 8.15pm. Follow all the latest developments here: Now for some Spinal Tap news. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not another tour sadly, but a lawsuit. As the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies reports: The band members from cult rock mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap have agreed to reunite in a bid they claim will ensure a $400m (\u00c2\u00a3321m) lawsuit against media firm Vivendi \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goes to 11\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Three of the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-creators and stars have agreed to get back together to join co-star Harry Shearer in a suit against the French firm, the parent company of Universal Music. Shearer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who also voices characters from The Simpsons such as Ned Flanders and Mr Burns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was suing Vivendi for $125m, claiming it has not properly shared profits since buying the rights to the film in 1989. The addition of the rest of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153band members\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c famed for their pretentious musical posturing and catty infighting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has boosted the size of the claim to $400m. The off-screen reunion brings together the characters of bassist Derek Smalls (played by Shearer), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), lead vocalist and guitarist David St Hubbins (Michael McKean), as well as director and narrator Rob Reiner. Reiner said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such anti-competitive practices need to be exposed. I am hoping this lawsuit goes to 11.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany says trade with Britain is already dwindling following the Brexit vote. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DIHK Chambers of Commerce said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU had hit business and that trade between the UK and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy fell 3% last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade with the United Kingdom has already suffered a significant blow,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DIHK managing director Martin Wansleben told a press conference. Back in Athens, a prominent Greek politician is warning that a compromise needs to be reached if a fresh crisis is to be avoided. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports: The European parlaiment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice president and Syriza party MEP, Dimitris Papadimoulis, has said that all sides need to step back and compromise so that a repeat of the summer of 2015 is avoided. In an interview that also addressed Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly strained ties with Turkey, he told the Turkish news agency Anadolu: All sides need to make the necessary compromises in order to find a compromise solution. It is not good for the European Union to relive the summer of 2015. Papadimoulis ruled out early elections - long seen as the default position of a government under pressure to implement reforms to which it is wholly ideologically opposed. I give absolutely no possibility to the scenario of early elections. The French economy will grow by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2017, the Bank of France is forecasting. That would be a slight slowdown compared with the 0.4% growth rate achieved in the final quarter of 2016. European markets have got off to a mixed start this morning. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is down 18 points or 0.3% at 7,167. The FTSE 250 is up a fraction at 18,564 after closing at a new high on Tuesday. This is how it looks elsewhere: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: flat at 11,550 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 4,766 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.6% at 18,553 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,344 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 364 Away from Greece, bond markets are also looking tricky in France and Italy as political tensions mount. The prospect of a far-right win in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election this spring has further widened the gap between French borrowing costs and those in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsave haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Germany. The gap between France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government borrowing yield and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yields rose to 78.8 basis points, the highest since November 2012. Meanwhile the gap between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs also widened, to 201.8 basis points - the most in three years. Citi analysts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the trend changing any time soon: The ongoing elevated political headline risk is governing much of the spread tone in widening spreads. With the French presidential first round elections still over two months away, ongoing headline risks are likely to continue to weigh on the broader tone. Greek borrowing costs are rising as a fresh funding crisis looms. Yields on 10-year government bonds are above 7.6% this morning, while the yield on two-year bonds are above 10%, the highest since last summer. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest report on Greece contained a few startling graphics, including this one: Greece has not managed to return to sustainable growth, with output having contracted by more than 25% since 2008, investment down by more than 60%, and unemployment at the highest level in the eurozone. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says a fresh crisis in Greece would be bad timing politically across Europe: Fresh splits between the EU and IMF threaten to open a massive rift after the head of Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem criticised the IMF for being overly pessimistic about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects, saying that Greece was making good progress. The IMF on the other hand disagrees and appears unwilling to throw more money at a problem with no end unless EU creditors look at debt forgiveness, given the unsustainability of the current debt trajectory. A fresh flare up in the Greek crisis is particularly difficult timing given the proximity of elections in Holland, France and Germany, and a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn debt repayment due in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece is back in the headlines this morning following the fresh impasse that has emerged between its European creditors and the International Monetary Fund. In broad terms, the IMF believes Greek debts are unsustainable and on an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, raising doubts about the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation in the funding programme. The IMF wants to see Greek offered debt relief from its European creditors, who have so far ruled that out. Responding to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment, the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said there would be no such debt forgiveness, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes. We will be bringing you all the latest updates and commentary.",

It is also yet another incidence of that old adage, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnever short a quiet market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. European markets have exploded into life, helped along by rosy results from Total and SocGen. With gold out of favour and dollar yen testing the waters above Y113 again, it could be that we are on the cusp of a fresh recovery in risk assets, just a day after the market seemed poised to fall heavily. A fresh all-time high in the S&amp;P5 00 could be taken as proof that the rally is back on, but with a weekend looming traders may find it difficult to muster up much enthusiasm. Particular signs of strength are seen in US energy stocks, with the sector ETF up 1.1% today and 3% off the lows of the week. A turn in risk appetite needs the support of key sectors like this to be sustainable.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 40.68 points or 0.57% at 7229.50</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.86% to 11,642.86</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.25% to 4826.24</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.94% to 18,947.44</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.17% at 9438.4</strong></li> <li><strong>But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.34% to 608.79</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 121 points or 0.6% higher, around 20 points off the new all time high it reached earlier in the day.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

Few were surprised, therefore, when the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a05f1ee-ed52-11e6-930f-061b01e23655\">International Monetary Fund</a> recently stated that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt was on an alarming trajectory.</p> <p>A sober look at the facts shows that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63d8b354-ed5e-11e6-930f-061b01e23655\">Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt situation</a> does not have to be cause for alarm. The European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue funds, have disbursed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac174bn to Greece. We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back...</p> <p>The solution for Greece lies not in additional debt relief, but in the government implementing reforms so as to avoid delays in the issuing of the next tranche of the ESM loan. Investors understand the ESM framework and recognise the commitments of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European partners. Past experience shows that making loans in exchange for reforms works. It is no coincidence that Ireland and Spain today have some of the highest growth rates in Europe and very low funding costs after successfully completing rescue loan programmes with demanding reforms.</p> <p>In 2016, even Greece outperformed expectations, with a higher than anticipated growth rate and a primary surplus.

                "bodyText":"A buoyant oil price and comments from President Trump about imminent tax announcements have helped outweigh the continuing political worries surrounding forthcoming French, Dutch and German elections, and the reappearance of the Greek crisis in the headlines. So with some help from an opening rise on Wall Street, European markets ended the day in positive territory. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The bounce in markets today reminds us that it is never wise to underestimate the strength of a bull market. It is also yet another incidence of that old adage, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnever short a quiet market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. European markets have exploded into life, helped along by rosy results from Total and SocGen. With gold out of favour and dollar yen testing the waters above Y113 again, it could be that we are on the cusp of a fresh recovery in risk assets, just a day after the market seemed poised to fall heavily. A fresh all-time high in the S&amp;P5 00 could be taken as proof that the rally is back on, but with a weekend looming traders may find it difficult to muster up much enthusiasm. Particular signs of strength are seen in US energy stocks, with the sector ETF up 1.1% today and 3% off the lows of the week. A turn in risk appetite needs the support of key sectors like this to be sustainable. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 40.68 points or 0.57% at 7229.50 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.86% to 11,642.86 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.25% to 4826.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.94% to 18,947.44 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.17% at 9438.4 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.34% to 608.79 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 121 points or 0.6% higher, around 20 points off the new all time high it reached earlier in the day. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. When it raised US interest rates in December the Federal Reserve suggested there could be three increases in 2017. But St Louis Fed president James Bullard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although a non-voting member at present \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems to disagree: Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new record high of 20,157. The US markets have been buoyed by a rise in oil prices, and comments on a forthcoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax announcement and rolling back regulations from President Trump. And Greece again, as IMF spokesman Gerry Rice says the fund is not asking for more austerity for the country: And: Rice has also defended the IMF after the comments earlier from European bailout boss Klaus Regling: Comments from President Trump that he will make an announcement about taxes in two to three weeks and continue to roll back regulations have given more support to the US stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 0.32%. Back with Greece and Klaus Regling, the managing director of bailout fund the European Stability Mechanism, has taken issue with the gloomy prognosis for the country given by the IMF. Writing in the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3) he says: For many, Greece remains synonymous with bad news. Few were surprised, therefore, when the International Monetary Fund recently stated that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt was on an alarming trajectory. A sober look at the facts shows that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt situation does not have to be cause for alarm. The European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue funds, have disbursed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac174bn to Greece. We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back... The solution for Greece lies not in additional debt relief, but in the government implementing reforms so as to avoid delays in the issuing of the next tranche of the ESM loan. Investors understand the ESM framework and recognise the commitments of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European partners. Past experience shows that making loans in exchange for reforms works. It is no coincidence that Ireland and Spain today have some of the highest growth rates in Europe and very low funding costs after successfully completing rescue loan programmes with demanding reforms. In 2016, even Greece outperformed expectations, with a higher than anticipated growth rate and a primary surplus. Further delays could put this positive trend at risk. Over in the US and Wall Street is on the rise again, boosted by higher oil prices after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise fall in gasoline inventories. The Dow Jones has added 0.22% or 45 points while the Nasdaq Composite has hit a new record high, up 0.27% at 5,698. The S&amp;P 500 has added 0.21% and is just a point below its peak of 2,300 hit at the end of January. An early chance to get the latest views of the new deputy governor of the Bank of England Charlotte Hogg comes courtesy of the University of Lincoln: She will be at the university on 6 March, just days after her new appointment takes effect. They probably need to send an updated tweet, though. As the chancellor announced the appointment of one female to a senior role at Threadneedle Street, the Bank revealed another was leaving. Kristin Forbes, an external member of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, will leave the Bank on 30 June after a three-year term. Forbes will return to her role as professor of management and global economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this autumn. She was considered to be one of the most hawkish members of the MPC - in favour of tighter monetary policy - and voted against the decision of the majority of her colleagues to extend quantitative easing in August. Mark Carney, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, thanked Forbes for her contributions on the MPC: She has brought insight, fresh thinking and academic rigour to our deliberations, as well as a fresh and engaging approach to communications. On behalf of colleagues at the Bank, I would like to wish her well as she returns to pursue her academic career at MIT on a full time basis. Forbes said: It has been an honour and a privilege to serve on the Monetary Policy Committee during these historic years. I will miss the insightful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often intense \u00e2\u20ac\u201c debates with my colleagues on the MPC, as well as the superb analysis and support of the staff. I would like to thank the Treasury and Bank of England for welcoming someone from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcacross the pond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for this important role, as well as MIT for restructuring my responsibilities to them so that I could prioritize this role in the United Kingdom over my term. Want to know more about Charlotte Hogg, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new deputy governor (from March)? Fortunately my colleague Rupert Neate profiled her back in 2013. In brief: Name Charlotte Hogg Born London 26 August 1970 Education St Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Roman Catholic boarding school, Ascot. Studied economics and history at Hertford College, Oxford. Won a Kennedy scholarship to Harvard. Parents Douglas and Sarah Hogg. Both had leading roles in Sir John Major\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. Career to date Joined the Bank of England as a graduate trainee. Became principal at management consultant McKinsey. Managing director, Morgan Stanley. Managing director, Experian UK and Ireland. Head of retail operations, Santander. Starts as chief operating officer at the Bank of England next month, effectively No 2 to the new governor, Mark Carney. High point Winning the Aston-le-Walls horse trials on On a Par in 2010; securing the acquisition of the Goldfish credit card for Morgan Stanley in 2006. What she says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can have too much of a good thing in one family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (about not going into politics or law). What they say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was clearly a life of intense privilege. You could not image two better-connected people than her parents. They are the ultimate power couple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c family friend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She is clearly an incredibly capable and intelligent woman, so this appointment is just deserts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dr Ruth Sealy, Cranfield School of Management Read the full profile here: Breaking: The Treasury has just announced that Charlotte Hogg will succeed Minouche Shafik as deputy governor of the Bank of England for markets and banking. Hogg is currently the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief operating officer. She will start the new role on 1 March for a renewable term of five years. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delighted to appoint Charlotte Hogg as the next Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident that her exceptional leadership skills and wide-ranging experience make her the right person to take on the position. Charlotte has done an excellent job as the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first chief operating officer. She will take over this new role at a key time for the City. I would like to thank Minouche Shafik for all her valuable work at the Bank, particularly on fair and effective markets. I wish her the best as she moves into her new role as Director of the London School of Economics. On the jobless claims, Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Donald Trump continues to place jobs at the heart of his successful run at the presidency, and he will breathe a sigh of relief at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downtick in initial jobless claims which are the lowest since November 2016. Readings of sub-300,000 tend to indicate a healthy labour market, and we are currently enjoying an almost two-year stretch below that watershed - the longest since 1970. However, these figures only tell part of the story, and while unemployment may be at historic lows, the challenge facing Trump now is to deliver substantive wage growth. Over in the US, and the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits showed a surprise decrease last week. Jobless claims fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000, compared to expectations of a rise to around 249,000. This is close to the 43-year low of 233,000 reached early last November. Claims have remained below 300,000 for 101 straight weeks, the best run since 1970. Meanwhile Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour minister Efi Achtsioglou has called the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153problematic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and its demands \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Kathimerini newspaper is reporting: Speaking after a visit to the Labor Inspection Corps in Alexandroulpoli, northern Greece, the minister who holds of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stickiest portfolios said the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for the upfront legislation of measures to be passed if Greece fails to hit targets at the end of the bailout program is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economically unreasonable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim, she said, is to wrap up the pending bailout review as soon as possible so that Greece can join the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing (QE) program and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consolidate the trend of improvement seen in the Greek economy this past year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For our part, we have already implemented nearly 80 percent of the prior actions. Only labor reform is still pending precisely because of this disagreement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Achtsioglou said. Her priority, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is to put a brake on the autocratic practices of employers, which have intensified recently, mainly as a result of the disintegration of the institutional framework of labor relations in the 2010-2014 period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The minister reiterated the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim to reintroduce collective labor bargaining \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are staunchly opposed to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c arguing that this would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide workers with a safety net and create the conditions for healthy competition between businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More now from Greece, where farmers are stepping up protests over unpopular creditor-mandated austerity measures including higher taxes. In a move that will put the Greek government under further pressure to bow to their demands, farmers and stockbreeders escalated their protests today blockading the customs post at Kristallopygi on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s border with Albania. Describing the move as symbolic, Dimitris Moskos who sits on the committee representing farmers in the region, said the blockade would last 24 hours. At least 250 stockbreeders and farmers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many on tractors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were participating in the rally. Launching nationwide protests two weeks ago, farmers vowed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to go all the way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in what some are calling an increasingly desperate attempt to lower tax rates, fuel prices and social security contributions. Theodoros Papaconstantinou, also representing farmers in northern Greece, said: There is no other way. People need to fight for their rights, for their social security and for decent prices for their agricultural products if they want to survive. Tax rates for the sector are being doubled from 13% to 26% while pensions are being cuts by as much as 60% by 2022. Farmers, who last week took similar action at the Greek-Macedonian border, have vowed to take their protests to Athens next, descending on the capital on Tuesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day. It follows protests in Athens on Wednesday by Greek firefighters, who say a third of jobs are at risk because of hiring restrictions placed on the public sector by the terms of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international bailout. Here is our full story on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results: Thomas Cook has caved in to shareholder pressure and reduced the maximum payout under a long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, after a third of investors voted against the controversial plan. Provisional results from the annual meeting showed just under 33% of the travel company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders opposed its plan to pay its boss Peter Fankhauser a bonus of up to 225% of base salary, worth about \u00c2\u00a31.6m a year. The firm has cut the maximum award to 165%, and said shareholders would be consulted before any payout. The share price has fallen almost 8% in the past year as Thomas Cook, along with the rest of the travel industry, was hit by a spate of terror attacks in Turkey and elsewhere in Europe. One retail investor spoke out against the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge bonus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the AGM in London. Addressing the board, Sunil Kumar Pal, who has held Thomas Cook shares for about 15 years, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the one hand you say business is not going well and on the other hand you give such a huge bonus...at more than twice salary. You should review this policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But another retail investor leapt to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, thanking the management for the job it had done. At last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM, Thomas Cook also suffered a shareholder revolt over executive pay with a quarter of investors voting against, and cut Fankhauser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay package to \u00c2\u00a31.2m from \u00c2\u00a34.3m. Twitter shares have fallen 10% to $16.81 after the social media site reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since going public. Revenue rose just 1% to $717.2m, missing analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of $740.1m. Jack Dorsey, chief executive: While revenue growth conti nues to lag audience growth we are applying the same focused approach that drove audience growth to our revenue product portfolio. This will take time, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving fast to show results. Full story soon. Market update: shares in Greece are down, but major markets elsewhere in Europe are up. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ATG: -0.5% at 608 FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,208 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.7% at 11,622 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.8% at 4,807 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 18,782 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.6% at 9,385 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 366 Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says US markets are likely to be similarly subdued: Looking ahead to the US open and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dreary trading is set to continue, with the Dow Jones promising a meagre 0.1% increase after the bell. That keeps the Dow below 20,100, with only the jobless claims to spark any excitement as the afternoon gets underway. Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister and nemesis of Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has given his latest view on the funding crisis engulfing his country. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, he said everyday life in Greece was unsustainable, with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European creditors going after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the little people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, rather than corrupt oligarchs. The country has been put on a fiscal path which makes our everyday life unsustainable in Greece. The German finance minister agrees that no Greek government, however reformist it might be, can sustain the current debt obligations of Greece. A country in desperate need of reform has been made unreformable by unsustainable macroeconomic policies. Instead of attacking the worst cases of corruption, for six years now the creditors have been after the little people, the small pharmacists, the very poor pensioners instead of going for the oligarchies. We must come to terms with reality. The tragedy is that in 2010 a bankrupt country was given a huge loan, not to save it but in order to cynically transfer huge banking losses from the books of the Franco German banks onto the shoulders of the weakest taxpayers in Europe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like giving a credit card to a bankrupt entity in order to keep paying its debt, and then giving it another credit card and another. As long as you do that, Greece is unreformable and that is an indictment on the whole functioning of the eurozone Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough-talking finance minister, says Greece must leave the eurozone if it wants a debt cut. He told German broadcaster ARD that debt forgiveness would be in violation of European rules. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t undertake a debt haircut for a member of the European single currency, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruled out by the Lisbon Treaty. For that, Greece would have to exit the currency area. The pressure on Greece to undertake reforms must be maintained so that it becomes competitive, otherwise they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remain. The prestigious AAA credit rating is getting increasingly difficult to come by, according to Fitch. The ratings agency said it has just 11 countries on the top tier rating, compared with a record high of 16 during the period between 2004 and 2009. The financial crisis is to blame, of course. Fitch said all its triple A sovereigns had a stable outlook, suggesting there would be no downgrades over the next 12 to 24 months. The 11 countries which still make the grade: Australia Canada Denmark Germany Luxembourg Netherlands Norway Singapore Sweden Switzerland US James McCormack, global head of sovereign ratings at Fitch: This is less than 10% of Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global sovereign portfolio, the smallest ever share for the rating category, and consistent with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereigns now accounting for 40% of global government debt at end-2016, down from 48% a decade ago. Japan was the first sovereign to be stripped of its AAA rating by Fitch in 1998, followed by another six in the aftermath of the global financial crisis over the seven years since 2009: Austria Finland France Ireland Spain UK The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helena Smith says progress is essential at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup Working Group* meeting, if a deal is to to struck on 20 February when the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministers next meet. She reports from Athens: Greek officials are calling the Euro Working Group - scheduled for this afternoon - crucial. As the latest Greek crisis plays out, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting has assumed a significance that few might have expected, even if some officials are saying a solution to breaking the deadlock of stalled negotiations can now only be found at a political level. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we are expecting today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one government source, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is for all the sides to open their cards to see if they really want an agreement or are still stuck to their positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek government had shown it wanted to break the impasse but only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so far as it can go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European officials this morning were citied in the Greek media as saying almost no progress had been made since the last Eurogroup in January. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to legislate fiscal measures up front - measures that would take effect when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout expires in 2018 - and the ongoing rift between creditor institutions over what exactly Athens should do were also cited as the greatest impediments to finding a solution. If today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EWG session fails to break the deadlock it is almost certain that auditors will be unable to return to continue the review next week which in turn will limit the prospects of any deal on 20 February when euro area finance ministers next meet. *The Eurogroup Working Group is composed of representatives from eurozone countries who assist the Eurogroup (finance ministers) and its president (Jeroen Dijsselbloem) in preparing for ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 discussions. They meet once a month, ahead of Eurogroup meetings. Greece would be better off outside the eurozone where its debts could be written off, according to a leading German politician. Christian Lindner, leader of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Free Democratic Party, told the German radio station, Deutschlandfunk: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that Greece needs to have its debts written off. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts can only be written off outside of the eurozone, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about Grexit. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European creditors have so far refused to offer Greece debt relief, despite calls for them to do by the International Monetary Fund. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all about political uncertainty and market fears, sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about bees and honey... In the first UK trial of its kind, Tesco will ship discarded sugar from split bags in stores in Devon and Cornwall to a beekeepers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 group. The sugar will be used to make a solution to feed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bees, struggling to get enough nectar to feed themselves. Nick Bentham-Green, chairman of the Bee Improvement Programme for Cornwall said: Recent poor summers have contributed to bees struggling to get enough stores into the hives to feed their colony throughout the winter. This new scheme is a great help, especially at this time of year, and is helping towards the conservation of the native British honey bee. Full story here: Ahead of Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting in London at 10.30am, a shareholder group, Institutional Shareholder Services, has questioned the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to pay Fankhauser a bonus of up to 225% of his base salary, amounting to up to \u00c2\u00a31.6m a year. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic share incentive plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would pay out in five years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time at the earliest and depends on several sets of performance targets. The vote on this bonus plan will be binding. While the company does not expect to lose it, it could well get a bloody nose. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been here before. Last year, a quarter of shareholders voted against the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remuneration plans - so Thomas Cook cut the share award to Fankhauser to 165% of base salary, from a planned 200%. It is worth noting that the standard share award at the company is 150% of base salary, but it has\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid out in recent years because the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been great. The fall in Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price (now down 9.7%) is the biggest one-day drop since late June in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was a challenging time: Times are tough in the European travel industry and Thomas Cook isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t having the best of it, though the good news is things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be getting any worse. Like-for-like revenues and losses were broadly flat on last year, which probably represents a small victory against such a competitive backdrop. However there is little in its latest trading figures to suggest Thomas Cook is going to stave off a shareholder rebellion over its executive remuneration package, which looks to be brewing. Greece will take some comfort from Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning that bookings for holidays in the country are up more than 40%. The travel company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it had expanded its holiday offering to Greece and smaller destinations such as Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria and Portugal, which are also seeing double-digit growth. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are catering for 500,000 more guests this year in Greece. We have more beds, more own-brand hotels, and 2 more flights going to Greece from the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas Cook is shifting some capacity from Spain to Greece and will secure more beds in Greece if demand continues to rise, he added. However, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares dropped 9%, even though it insisted it had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the year, as investors worried about the impact of terror attacks on travel to Turkey. Like-for-like revenues in the three months to December edged up 1% to \u00c2\u00a31.6bn. Operating losses improved to \u00c2\u00a349m from \u00c2\u00a350m a year earlier. Shares in Thomas Cook are down 9% this morning after the travel company published results for its first quarter. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance for the first three months \u00e2\u20ac\u0153against at backdrop of continued uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: We remain cautious about the rest of the year, given the uncertain political and economic outlook. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still relatively early in the selling cycle for summer holidays, but based on current trading, and supported by further financial benefits from implementing our strategy, we expect our full year operating results to be in line with current market expectations. One of the most striking points was that bookings to Greece have jumped 40% compared with the same period last year. Thomas Cook is laying on more holidays to the country, as UK tourists stay away from Turkey and Egypt over safety concerns. The company is also facing a potential pay revolt when shareholders vote at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting later today. We will bring you updates. The FTSE 100 is slightly higher in early trading, up 13 points or 0.2% at 7,201. After another closing high on Wednesday, the FTSE 250 is also up 0.2% at 18,635. Major markets across Europe are also higher: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.5% at 11,596 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.7% at 4,798 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 18,786 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,360 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 365 Political uncertainty has also kept equity investors guessing. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says that trying to work out which way markets are heading is like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wading through treacle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Equity markets in Europe have continued to chop in and out of positive territory for most of the past few days, as rising political uncertainty serves to keep investors in limbo, though the FTSE 250 has continued to outperform, closing at another record high yesterday. So far this year equity markets across Europe for all the ups and downs seen in the last few weeks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too far from where they started the year, as investors try to look through the fog of politics in France, Germany, the Netherlands, as well as the banking issues in Italy and the possibility of new elections there, as well as the perennial problem child of Greece. Is it any wonder that trying to find any sort of market direction is like wading through treacle? US markets finished the day rather more mixed but only marginally below their record highs. US investors appear reluctant to throw in the towel on the Trump reflation trade quite yet, but there are signs of doubt as to whether it will actually arrive, so distracted does the new President appear to be with taking on his opponents. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political tensions in Europe and the US are fuelling investor caution, with gold prices at three-month highs as demand for the safe have asset rises. US gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,241.30 an ounce, while spot gold hovers around $1,240 an ounce. Investors are concerned by the wave of elections coming up in Europe, not least in France where the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen - who is promising a referendum on EU memberhip - has gained strong support. In the US, uncertainty reigns over President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Barnabas Gan, analyst at OCBC Bank, says gold prices are likely to rise further over the next few weeks: Gold prices will be a little bit rangebound with some upside bias for the next few weeks or so. The risk factors have not really changed so far - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about Donald Trump, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about the political situation in Europe and because of all these factors, we do expect market watchers to stay cautious in the months ahead to gauge how the global economy is going to perform.",

The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said this could be an early sign for concern about future consumer spending patterns:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer confidence retreated from the decade-peak recorded in January, with the decline centered in the Expectations Index. To be sure, confidence remains quite favorable, with only five higher readings in the past decade.</p> <p>Importantly, the data do not reflect any closing of the partisan divide. The Michigan survey includes several free-response questions which ask respondents to answer in their own words, without any prompting or proposed answer categories. When asked to describe any recent news that they had heard about the economy, 30% spontaneously mentioned some favorable aspect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, and 29% unfavorably referred to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies.</p> <p>Thus a total of nearly six-in-ten consumers made a positive or negative mention of government policies.

While currently distorted by partisanship, the best bet is that the gap will narrow to match a more moderate pace of growth. Nonetheless, it has been long known that negative rather than positive expectations are more influential in determining spending, so forecasts of consumer expenditures must take into account a higher likelihood of asymmetric downside risks. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-589dcecde4b012eeb30c8882\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T14:43:46.649Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow hits new peak as Wall Street opens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors appear to be shrugging off the warnings from Fitch that Donald Trump poses a risk to the global economy.

There has been some divergence, with the US markets hitting new peaks and the UK outperforming European markets, amid worries about Greece and the forthcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany.

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. More on Greece from Helena Smith: There is no reason why the IMF should be part of the Greek rescue deal, according to ECB member and president of the National Bank of Austria, Ewald Nowotny. Germany has said the IMF must be part of the Greek solution, but in an interview with Der Standard (in German), Nowotny said: I do not understand why at the EU level one insists that the fund is on board. This would only be an additional complication, which does not contribute to the solution of the problem. There is neither economic nor political justification. Greece is a European problem, and Europe will solve it. I fear, politicians deliberately create a crisis scenario, the solution of which is uncertain. Because we do not know the role of the IMF under the influence of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s United States. So, if the next financial crisis comes, where could it start? Perhaps with car loans. Patrick Collinson reports: A huge increase in the amounts borrowed by already indebted households in Britain and the US to buy new vehicles is fuelling fears that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sub-prime cars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could ignite the next financial crash. British households borrowed a record \u00c2\u00a331.6bn in 2016 to buy cars, up 12% on the year before, said the Finance and Leasing Association on Friday. Nine out of 10 private car buyers are now using personal contract plans (known as PCPs), which have boomed since interest rates fell to historic lows. Under these cheap leasing deals, buyers pay a small deposit and then commit to making a monthly payment for the next three years with the option to buy or hand back the car at the end. The rise of PCPs helps to explain rocketing car sales in Britain despite flat or falling household incomes. A record 2.7m new cars were sold in Britain last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fifth year in a row of rising sales. Per head, the British are buying more new cars than any other large country in Europe. Car financing in the UK is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flashing light\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Andrew Evans, a fund manager at investment firm Schroders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Borrowing is a very bad idea when it is done against a depreciating asset \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 such as a car,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding that there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious level of fragility built into the system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The full story is here: Markets continue to move higher, more so in the US and UK than in Europe, where investors worry about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt problems and the uncertainty over the forthcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all hitting new peaks on the back of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promised tax reforms, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The final session of the week confirms that the bulls are in charge once again. Yet more record highs for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 all point to a re-energised rally for stock markets, and while there has been a modest intraday wobble, this has simply provided a fresh chance for some new buyers to hop on board. Investors looked like they had fallen out of love with mining stocks earlier this week, but it appears this too was just a brief period of disillusionment and now the romance is back on... Earnings season is beginning to wind down in the US, but overall the period has not seen any major surprises, and the promise of a Trump tax plan seems perfectly calculated to keep markets on the front foot. Just in case you thought the latest Greek drama might threaten to come to an early resolution: On the NIESR data, Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: The NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest estimate suggests UK economic output accelerated impressively during the three months ending in January, in what is the latest sign of a resilient UK economy. The post-Brexit Armageddon predicted by so many is still absent, with consistent growth since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s votes leaving economists eating humble pie for now. However, a period of uncertainty is imminent. Prime Minister Theresa May has the mandate to trigger Article 50 in the coming weeks and forecasts predict GDP will enter a downwards spiral in 2017. The Brexit-hit pound is expected to drive inflation and could squeeze consumer spending. Back with the UK, and more signs of improvement in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy after better than expected trade, construction and manufacturing figures earlier. In the three months to the end of January, the economy grew by 0.7%, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. This compares to a figure of 0.6% in the three months to the end of December. Oriol Carreras, research fellow at NIESR, said: Growth was driven by robust consumer spending combined with a pickup in output in production industries. This represents the first expansion of production, on a three month on three month rolling basis, since September 2016. Despite our estimates indicating a strong start of 2017, we expect economic growth to soften to 1.7 per cent this year as rising consumer price inflation weighs on consumer spending. At the start of this month, NIESR forecast that GDP grew by 2% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. It seems US consumers are not as confident as had been expected, with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies (not surprsingly) dominating sentiment. The preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for February came in at 95.7, compared to forecasts of 97.9 and January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final figure of 98.5. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said this could be an early sign for concern about future consumer spending patterns: Consumer confidence retreated from the decade-peak recorded in January, with the decline centered in the Expectations Index. To be sure, confidence remains quite favorable, with only five higher readings in the past decade. Importantly, the data do not reflect any closing of the partisan divide. The Michigan survey includes several free-response questions which ask respondents to answer in their own words, without any prompting or proposed answer categories. When asked to describe any recent news that they had heard about the economy, 30% spontaneously mentioned some favorable aspect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies, and 29% unfavorably referred to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies. Thus a total of nearly six-in-ten consumers made a positive or negative mention of government policies. In the long history of the surveys, this total had never reached even half that amount, except for five surveys in 2013 and 2014 that were solely dominated by negative references to the debt and fiscal cliff crises. Moreover, never before have these spontaneous references to economic policies had such a large impact on the Sentiment Index: a difference of 37 Index points between those that referred to favorable and unfavorable policies. These differences are troublesome: the Democrat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Expectations Index is close to its historic low (indicating recession) and the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Expectations Index is near its historic high (indicating expansion). While currently distorted by partisanship, the best bet is that the gap will narrow to match a more moderate pace of growth. Nonetheless, it has been long known that negative rather than positive expectations are more influential in determining spending, so forecasts of consumer expenditures must take into account a higher likelihood of asymmetric downside risks. Investors appear to be shrugging off the warnings from Fitch that Donald Trump poses a risk to the global economy. Instead they are still concentrating on the prospect of further stimulus measures after the president promised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd news on tax reforms in the next few weeks. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record of 20,232 in early trading, before slipping back to 20,230, still up 58 points or 0.29%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also opened at new highs. More from Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner responsible for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union, currently on a visit to London. He hinted in a Q&amp;A session after his speech at Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s London HQ that the EU could go it alone on Greece should the IMF quit the scene. Our economics correspondent Phillip Inman was there. He says: Dombrovskis said all parties were close to pressing the button on the next phase of bail out cash for Athens even though the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for Greek growth and therefore public sector spending surplus were much lower than the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Nevertheless, he said that the European Stability Mechanism, which has lent \u00e2\u201a\u00ac174bn to Greece, has a rulebook and this stresses that it is only preferable and not necessary for parties other than the ESM and European Central Bank to be involved in any rescue. Many executives at the IMF believe Greece cannot hope to repay its debts while the economy remains flat on its back. It is considering whether to pull out of a joint rescue with the EU. By focussing on the rulebook in his answer, Dombrovskis is giving a clear hint that Brussels is prepared to impose a deal on Athens with the ECB and wave goodbye to the IMF. Fitch says the countries most at risk of a sovereign downgrade are those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with close economic and financial ties with the US that come under scrutiny due to either existing financial imbalances or perceptions of unfair frameworks or practices that govern their bilateral relations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Canada, China, Germany, Japan and Mexico for starters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but the list is unlikely to end there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fitch warns. Fitch has just issued a warning that President Trump poses a risk to the global economy, raising the prospect that countries will suffer a rating downgrade. The ratings agency highlighted Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpredictability, trade relations, limits on migration, and rows between policymakers as areas of concern: The Trump Administration represents a risk to international economic conditions and global sovereign credit fundamentals. US policy predictability has diminished, with established international communication channels and relationship norms being set aside and raising the prospect of sudden, unanticipated changes in US policies with potential global implications. The primary risks to sovereign credits include the possibility of disruptive changes to trade relations, diminished international capital flows, limits on migration that affect remittances and confrontational exchanges between policymakers that contribute to heightened or prolonged currency and other financial market volatility. The materialisation of these risks would provide an unfavourable backdrop for economic growth, putting pressure on public finances that may have rating implications for some sovereigns. Increases in the cost or reductions in the availability of external financing, particularly if accompanied by currency depreciation, could also affect ratings. Fitch does say that elements of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic agenda would be positive for growth, including his pledge to spend more on US infrastructure. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, has been talking to Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens. She reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is being pressurised yet again to extend and deepen its crisis and become even more unreformable just because the creditors cannot agree with one another on how to deal with the mess they created in 2010,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Varoufakis said, referring to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac110bn Athens received in the form of a first bailout. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153India under the British Empire had more power than Greece has today under the third memorandum of understanding (bailout). Varoufakis said the rescue remedies Greece was being forced to follow was tantamount to giving \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cortisone to a cancer patient.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The crisis, if snuffed out this time, would be reignited as soon as debt repayments matured again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Follow the money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he quipped. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in the eurozone is impossible without debt restructuring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit is a football being kicked around between [the German finance minister] Dr Schauble and [the German Chacellor] Mrs Merkel. Schauble is determined to kick Greece out and Merkel is determined not to make a decision until she really must,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Varoufakis said. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner responsible for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union, is on a visit to London, and has taken a more sophisticated route to issuing the UK with threats of economic disaster. Phillip Inman reports: In line with other senior Brussels officials, who appear to be less bombastic about the threat to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy from Brexit, Dombrovskis said that the EU will always be welcoming to British businesses and sees no threat to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing as an international financial centre. But he warned that a failure to stay aligned with EU rules will make it increasingly difficult for Brussels to negotiate a deal with low tariff trade barriers and for low tariff trade to remain in place. Speaking at Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s London offices about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Accelerating the Capital Markets Union\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said: Far from being held back by international rules and standards agreed in the last decade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c London has been thriving. And regardless of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU, London will only continue to thrive on the basis of a strong international system. The sting in the tail came with the comment: We very much hope to continue working with all our partners internationally, but this is not only in our hands. What is in the hands of the EU, is to preserve recent reforms and firmly uphold our prudential framework. [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] He said equivalence was an important concept and the more the UK failed to meet requiremrents for equivalence, the less access it will have: Based on strong common international cooperation, the EU has been very open to recognise that our international partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rules are equivalent and achieve the same objective as ours. But these findings depend very much on the specific conditions of individual sectors and country at the time when the decisions are made. If these conditions change, we will have to reassess the situation. The clear warning is that if the UK adopts practices and rules that are not part of the EU system now or at any point in the future by signing trade deals with the US and other countries, then the EU will become closed to UK business. He said the EU will fight to develop and maintain common rules for global financial stability. But speeding up the creation of the Capital Markets Union is a priority and if London refuses to tag along, the EU will rely increasingly on its own capital markets. He said: We are also moving ahead with work to build a single market for capital, a Capital Markets Union. [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] We want to quicken the pace on existing work, such as measures to make business restructuring easier and plans to build a pan European private pensions market. Also to be more ambitious in the areas such as Fintech and sustainable finance. [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] The prospect of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest financial centre leaving the single market makes our task more challenging, but all the more important. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have fallen sharply as optimism rises that progress will be made on debt talks with its EU creditors. Two-year Greek government bond yields fell more than 110 basis points to 8.8%, moving away from seven-month highs above 10% earlier this weeks. Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategy for Dutch bank Rabobank: There seems to be a high degree of will to put this issue to bed prior to elections in the eurozone. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Europe minister, George Katrougalos, has expressed confidence that a deal will be struck between Athens and its creditors to unlock a further wave of funding. He told journalists on Thursday: I am optimistic that we can have such an agreement before the Eurogroup of 20 February. If we had just to deal with the Europeans we would have already completed this review in December. All the delay is due to the ambivalence of the IMF to participate or not to participate . He dismissed comments by the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, who said Greece must implement reforms or leave the eurozone. Katrougalos commented: Mr Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble is now an isolated voice in Europe, one of the last defenders of austerity. The market is Athens is up 3% as investors appear to be hopeful of a breakthrough between the Greek government and its European creditors. Reuters is reporting that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone lenders and the International Monetary Fund have reached an agreement on a common stance they will present to Greece, following a rift earlier in the week. The news agency quotes an unnamed senior eurozone official: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is agreement to present a united front to the Greeks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the euro zone official said, adding that the outcome of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with the Greeks was still unclear and it was unclear if Athens would accept the proposals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What comes out of it, we will see,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the official said. A united stance among euro zone governments and the IMF is a breakthrough because they have differed for months on the size of the primary surplus Greece should reach in 2018 and maintain for years later as well as the issue of debt relief. Those differences have hindered efforts to unlock further funding for Greece under its latest euro zone bailout program. Turning to Greece, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has urgently flown to Brussels in an attempt to end the deadlock in stalled talks between the country and its EU-led creditors. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a last ditch effort to break the deadlock that has once again ignited fears of a new Greek crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and default by the summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has rushed to Brussels for a meeting with the heads of the creditor institutions. Speculation is rife that the Oxford-educated Tsakalotos is prepared to make what the Greek media this morning are describing as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big compromise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in order to clinch a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd agreement with lenders before euro area finance minister hold their monthly Eurogroup session on 20 February. If sealed, auditors would return to Athens next week in the hopes of finally concluding the compliance review at the heart of the impasse. Tsakalotos is expected to be presented with an alternative set of measures that Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government could put its signature to in time for a deal to be reached before Europe goes into election mode, starting with polls in the Netherlands next month. The proposal, to be presented to the minister this afternoon, is believed to be more palatable in that the government would not have to legislate contingency measures (not least tax increases and pension cuts) before the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout expires in the summer of 2018. The cuts are thought to amount to 2 percent of Greek gross domestic product and would only be implemented if Athens fails to meet the budget targets agreed under its latest bailout. If true, the face-saving formula may avert the spectre of bankruptcy this summer when Greek faces a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn debt repayment in July, but is unlikely to resolve the lingering problem of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountainous debt or go down well with many in the ruling Syriza party who have become increasingly restive at the prospect of inflicting yet more measures on austerity-whipped Greeks. So far Friday has been a day of forecast-beating data from China and the UK. But investor sentiment is underpinned by comments from President Trump, whose every word is closely scrutinised. He dangled a big carrot on Thursday, promising to reveal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax plans within a matter of two or three weeks. Sean Spicer, White House spokesman, elaborated on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, suggesting the biggest overhaul in US personal and business taxes since President Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tax Reform Act of 1986. [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be] a comprehensive plan, something we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen since 1986 ... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need. What he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boom!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So says Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke about the flurry of decent UK data today on trade, manufacturing and construction in December. He says GDP data for the fourth quarter could be revised to show the economy grew by 0.7% between October and December, and not 0.6% as first estimated by the ONS last month. Clarke explains: Yes these are backwards looking since they relate to December. BUT the preliminary Q4 GDP data had made assumptions for how these would perform and those assumptions were far too pessimistic. The punchline is that other things equal, this points to Q4 GDP being revised UP to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. We all thought the Bank of England were mad when they came out with a 2% growth forecast for this year. They may come out of this looking very smart. The pound has been given a slight boost by the forecast-beating UK data. It is currently hovering just above the $1.25 mark. Sterling is also up 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1742. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the ONS data suggests growth is becoming more balanced. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK economic activity data added to other evidence suggesting that the economy maintained a significant amount of momentum at the end of 2016 and implies that growth is becoming more balanced. The December output figures do provide a base for more balanced growth in 2017. Indeed, we think that the expansion in manufacturing activity will exceed that in services for the first time since 2011, as the manufacturing sector gets a competitive boost from the fall in the pound, but consumer services growth is constrained by rising inflation. Growth in the UK has been heavily on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers since the financial crisis. Services is the only main sector of the UK economy where output has surpassed pre-crisis levels. Manufacturing and construction has lagged. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how Asia closed: Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, is commenting on the UK data. She says there is no evidence that a weaker pound is having an impact on trade: The UK trade deficit narrowed to \u00c2\u00a38.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016 as exports of products including oil and aircraft to non-EU countries increased. There was also a notable increase in export sales of gold to overseas buyers. While both exports and imports grew over 2016, there remains little evidence that the weaker pound has had an effect on the trade balance. Industrial output and the construction sector both remained broadly flat over the final quarter of 2016 but grew in December, with manufacturing growth driven by a strong month for often volatile pharmaceuticals and the expansion in construction led by house and commercial building. The UK economy was in better-than-expected shape in December according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. A quick summary: The trade in goods deficit narrowed to \u00c2\u00a310.9bn from \u00c2\u00a311.6bn in November (itself revised down from \u00c2\u00a312.2bn) Industrial output rose 1.1% following 2% growth in November Manufacturing output jumped 2.1% from 1.4% in November Construction output was up 1.8%, following 0.4% growth previously No sign of a Brexit slowdown here.. Just Eat fell 6%, making it the biggest FTSE 250 faller, after chief executive David Buttress said he was stepping down. The online takeaway ordering service said Buttress was leaving the top job because of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgent family matters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He will work full time until the end of the first quarter when the chairman John Hughes will take over until a replacement is found. Buttress will stay on at the company as a non-executive director for a least a year. He said: It has been a great privilege to work alongside, and then lead, the exceptional team at Just Eat, helping to build the business from the very first restaurant in the UK to the company it is today. I would like to thank the board for their understanding, and I am very pleased that I will be able to continue to play a role in the future of the business as a non-executive director. This has been one of the best jobs in the world, and I wish my successor all the best when they take on the role. Hughes said Buttress had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an incredible leader and colleague\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who was leaving the business in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent health\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Coming up in less than half an hour we have a flurry of data from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office for National Statistics. The trade in goods deficit is expected to narrow slightly to \u00c2\u00a311.5bn in December from \u00c2\u00a312.2bn. Growth in industrial output is expected to slow to 0.2% in December from 2.1% rise in November. Manufacturing output growth is forecast to slow to 0.5%, following a 1.3 increase previously. Construction output is expected to rise 1% in December, following a 0.2% drop in November. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says the data will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153test\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the FTSE. The miners are the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top risers this morning, helped by the strong Chinese trade data which suggested global demand was in decent shape at the start of the year. The FTSE 100 is up 4o points or 0.6% in early trading, at 7,270. Markets elsewhere in Europe are also higher, with the exception of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB. There are fresh fears surrounding Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, after losses widened in the fourth quarter. The scores so far: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.5% at 11,698 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% at 4,842 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 18,892 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.2% at 9,455 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 368 Strong trade data from China is also giving investors that Friday feeling. Exports rose 7.9% in January, easily beating analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations and following a 6.1% drop in January. Imports rose by 16.7%, also beating forecasts. It pushed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus to $51.35bn for the month, the General Administration of Customs said, from $40.71bn in December. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swelling trade surplus is unlikely to go unnoticed at the White House, where Trump has threatened to take a new protectionist stance to trade. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the US was $21.37bn in January, slightly lower than the $21.73bn in December. Economists cautioned that trends in January and February can be distorted by the long Chinese new year celebrations. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, says: These figures need to be taken with a pinch of salt as annual shifts in the timing of Chinese New Year make year-on-year trade growth highly volatile at the start of each year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that much of the pick-up last month was seasonal. Admittedly, the holiday took place earlier this year than last, meaning that more of the disruptions to trade will have fallen in January. But it appears that this was more than offset by the fact that, unlike last year, all of the pre-holiday rush to import goods and meet exports orders fell in January too. Stepping back, the big picture is that Chinese trade values have been picking up in recent months thanks to a revival in global manufacturing, the continued strength of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic economy and the rebound in global commodity prices. We expect this improvement to be sustained in the short-run, even as Chinese New Year distortions mean that headline trade growth is likely to fall back sharply in February. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets have made strong gains following new record highs on Wall Street and a stronger dollar. The reason for this renewed investor optimism is the promise of more stimulus in the US. Specifically, President Trump said he would be announcing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something phenomenal in terms of tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the next two or three weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vague, but enough to boost investors hooked on stimulus, as CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson explains: The move to new record highs in equity markets and surge in the US dollar are symptomatic of a market craving a new stimulus. The risk is that as with most oases they turn out to be an illusion, and given the new President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s propensity for melodrama the risk is that this could well be no different. It is hard to imagine that he will be able to promise anything tangible within a two to three week window, however whatever the realities investors appear happy to take him at his word, as US markets closed well above their previous peaks, while the US dollar index looks set to post its first positive week this year. Investors might also be comforted by the more conciliatory note struck by the President with China, following his first conversation with President Xi Jinping since taking office. In Asia, the Nikkei was up 2.5%, the Hang Seng up 0.4% and the Topix up 2.2% and the Shanghai Composite up 0.4%. European markets are also expected to open higher: We will also bring you all the latest developments from Greece, where the government is hoping to stave off a fresh debt crisis.",

Mnuchin and Gary Cohn will be a more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinternationalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 influence on Trump, potentially putting a lid the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penchant for currency wars and trade tariffs.</p> <p>The benefit to Wall Street of having an ex-Goldman Sachs banker as Treasury Secretary is pretty self-evident. In extension, it would make sense for Mnuchin to fill key positions at the treasury with his people, namely other Wall Streeters. Senior Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan as well as Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley worker are reportedly being considered for key positions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-13T16:32:25.363Z\">at 4.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58a1cd50e4b09b65848eb2d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-13T15:14:47.405Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/831159038641573890\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Since Trump&#39;s election win:<br>- S&amp;P 500 +12%<br>- Dow +14%<br>- US bank stocks +25%<br>- Goldman Sachs +35%</p>&mdash; Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/831159038641573890\">February 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a1c748e4b0fcbf4e7d55eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-13T14:48:45.133Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/831151474654769152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: The collective market value of the S&amp;P 500 has surpassed $20 trillion for the first time ever <a href=\"https://t.co/SrmleFnMwn\">https://t.co/SrmleFnMwn</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sOTglP5EW0\">pic.twitter.com/sOTglP5EW0</a></p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/831151474654769152\">February 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a1c380e4b0fcbf4e7d55d2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-13T14:39:08.463Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets hit new highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected, Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hitting new peaks.</p> <p>The raised growth forecasts from the European Union have helped sentiment, but it is the return of the Trump bounce following a lull which is pushing markets higher again.

                "bodyText":"The return of the Trump trade - the boost to markets following the US presidential election - and upbeat economic forecasts from the European Commission combined to lift share prices on the first trading day of a busy week. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend sent Asian markets higher, and the upbeat mood continued elsewhere. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 20.17 points or 0.28% at 7278.92 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.92% to 11,774.43 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.24% to 4888.19 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 1.07% higher at 19,064.64 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.13% at 9484.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.86% to 629.14 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.65% at 20,402, close to the all time high of 20.404 touched earlier. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greece, and Fitch has said its current CCC junk credit rating depends on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors open the door to further funding before July. The agency said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our sovereign credit assessment is underpinned by our assumption that the second review of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme will be completed well ahead of July, maintaining access to official funding.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But despite signs of compromise, there are still disagreements among the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors. The IMF is reluctant to take part in a further bailout without further debt relief, but this is opposed by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European creditors. Fitch said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent events highlight that political risk remains a sovereign rating weakness for Greece, despite positive economic and fiscal developments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The agency pointed out that Greece faced payments of more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn in July, including \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.9bn to the European Central Bank. But it said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has broadly met programme conditions and recorded a primary surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2016 thanks to higher-than-budgeted revenues. GDP rose 1.8% year on year in the third quarter of 2016, the largest annual increase in over eight years. This progress is one reason that we think Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European creditors would be prepared to proceed with the second review and to disburse funds without IMF involvement. Another reason is their desire to avoid a Greek political crisis during an already congested election year in Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Completing the second programme review and disbursing the associated ESM funds would enable Greece to meet its July maturities... Doing so in a timely fashion and avoiding the level of brinksmanship of the first half of 2015 would reduce the risk that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is undermined by a hit to confidence or by the Greek government building up arrears to conserve liquidity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fitch is due to review Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CCC rating on 24 February. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, pointed to another possible reason for the continuing strength of the US market: Investors are pricing in the benefits of a Goldman Sachs-led Treasury Department. Steve Mnuchin [who spent 17 years at the investment bank] is in the final hours of his confirmation as Treasury secretary. He is expected to be confirmed around 7pm EST Monday. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda of financial deregulation will likely have another supporter in the form Mnuchin. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn will be a more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinternationalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 influence on Trump, potentially putting a lid the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penchant for currency wars and trade tariffs. The benefit to Wall Street of having an ex-Goldman Sachs banker as Treasury Secretary is pretty self-evident. In extension, it would make sense for Mnuchin to fill key positions at the treasury with his people, namely other Wall Streeters. Senior Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan as well as Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley worker are reportedly being considered for key positions. As expected, Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hitting new peaks. The raised growth forecasts from the European Union have helped sentiment, but it is the return of the Trump bounce following a lull which is pushing markets higher again. The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has helped the upbeat mood, while mining shares are benefiting from the prospect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure plans as well as capacity concerns after a strike at a BHP Billiton copper mine in Chile. The Dow is currently up 91 points at 20,360 having earlier touched 20,364, while the S&amp;P opened 0.24% higher and the Nasdaq 0.3%. In a sign that Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still fragile, and local spending power lower than the rest of the UK, a new survey has found that one out of every seven shops on the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets lies empty. The report for the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has noted that the shop vacancy rate is now at its lowest since 2011 in the depth of the recession.But the rate of empty premises has only fallen by 0.5 per cent in the last three months. Overall the vacancy rate in terms of shops in Northern Ireland - 14 per cent - remains the highest of any area of the UK. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Consortium, while accentuating the positive from the slight call in shop vacancy rates, also issued a warning about Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on local consumers. Connolly said that once a new power sharing executive is formed after the Assembly elections on 2 March, the next regional government must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put the consumer first during the Brexit negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said that with Northern Irish households having only half the spending power of their counterparts in Britain the next devolved government must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make the case for tariff free trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in order to continue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keeping show prices low once the UK leaves the European Union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief has now weighed in, warning MPs that the Greek bailout talks must be concluded quickly, before the economy is hurt by the uncertainty. Yannis Stournaras told the Athens parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs committee that time was running out, so both sides should make concessions to get a deal done. Stournaras (who was finance minister in an earlier phase of the Greek crisis), said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bailout review talks are at a very critical phase. The economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive momentum must be assured by the swift conclusion of the review. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Conditions could be much worse later, it may be too late.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This uncertainty is hitting Greek bonds today, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on two-year debt back over 9% - a dangerously high level. Traders are worried that Greece won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive its next tranche of bailout aid by the summer, when it must repay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn to its lenders. Back to Greece.... where senior officials are warning that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red lines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that cannot be overstepped to conclude the compliance review at the heart of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standoff with its creditors. In a strongly-worded interview this morning the interior minister, Panos Skourletis, insisted that the leftist-led government would not put its signature to an agreement that would doom Greece to a permanent debt deflationary cycle. Warning that the European Union \u00e2\u20ac\u0153might not exist in a few years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Skourletis told the leftist Syntaktwn newspaper: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An agreement that prolongs this state of uncertainty, that impedes growth and recycles recession cannot be accepted \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 no one can be sure if the European Union will exist in a few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Growing opposition to fresh austerity measures from the ruling Syriza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party base dominated a meeting of Syriza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive committee at the weekend. Under pressure to step up resistance to calls for further pension cuts and tax increases, prime minister Alexis Tsipras used the opportunity to urge German chancellor Angela Merkel to rein in her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble accusing him of plotting to create a two-speed euro zone. Speaking to the Guardian, the Syriza MP Hara Karafanti said Greece was paying the price of the ongoing spat between the IMF and EU over how to deal with the country. She also believes that Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands for fresh cuts are based on a false and outdated assessment of the Greek economy. Karafanti said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The demand for more measures is a result of the confusion that currently prevails between the creditor institutions.... The US stock market is expected to post further gains when trading begins in almost two hours time. That would add to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, and extend the rally that began with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock win three months ago. European stock markets have now hit their highest levels in 14 months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EC forecasts and the re-emergence of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have pushed the Stoxx 600 index to its highest level since December 2015. Mining shares are still showing solid gains, helped by predictions that the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of tax reforms will spur growth. Consumer goods firms, tech companies and industrial corporations are also leading the risers. Relief that Trump and Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit appears to have gone well are also pushing shares higher. But the optimism feels shaky, and could unravel if Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver on his tax pledges. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a relatively incident-free end to the week at the White House and thus the markets are starting off the Monday on a positive note further to the bilateral discussions between the heads of states of the US and Japan. While the US dollar has strengthened against the Yen over the backdrop of a cordial visit from Prime Minister Abe of Japan, the markets are cautious on what is oncoming within the next few weeks as president Trump promised to announce something \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the tax front. This is likely to be on Tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but considering he needs approval from Congress, the feasibility of fruition is still being questioned. If for instance the infrastructure spending aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approved, we may see a disappointed market bringing down the US dollar which continues to be strong despite the bumps and controversies caused by the Trump presidency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During questions on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts, Pierre Moscovici warned that the European project would be imperilled if Marine Le Pen wins the French presidency: The key takeaway from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European growth forecasts is that every member of the EU is expected to grow steadily from 2016 to 2018. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened since the financial crisis almost a decade ago. Despite the deadlock over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, the EC insists that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is on the right track. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts predict that Greek GDP will jump by 2.7%, up from a mere 0.3% last year, and then hit 3.1% growth in 2018. Speaking in Brussels, commissioner Pierre Moscovici says he will travel to Athens on Wednesday, to help conclude the current negotiations with its creditors - and hopefully unlock the next aid tranche. Remember: both sides are hoping for a breakthrough in time for the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on 20 February. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EC forecasts also predict that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will drop below the official target of 3% of GDP this year, only to swell over it again in 2018. That suggests it will be hard for the next president to boost government borrowing, without sparking a row with Brussels (although if Marine Le Pen wins, and pulls France out of the euro, these targets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply anyway). The EC also predicts that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate will hit 2.5% this year, as the weak pound pushes up the cost of living. The EC has also admitted that the Brexit vote has had less impact than previously thought. It is now less gloomy about growth this year -- raising its forecast from 1% to 1.5% in 2017 (before slowing to 1.2% in 2018). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of the vote by the U.K. to leave the EU in the referendum held on 23 June 2016 on growth has yet to be felt.... Recent momentum is projected to largely continue in the first quarter...[but] ease notably thereafter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The European Commission has upped its growth forecasts for the eurozone over the next two years. In its new Winter Forecasts, the EC now predicts eurozone GDP will rise by 1.6% this year, up from 1.5% previously. It also expects growth to accelerate to 1.8% in 2018, up from 1.7%. The EC also expects unemployment to keep falling from its current high levels. It expects the jobless rate to average 9.6% this year, down from 10% last year, and then fall to 9.1% in 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of the forecasts: Martin Schulz, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Social Democratic Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidate for chancellor, has given politicians in Greece food for thought - and some glee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this morning by warning that talk of a Greek exit from the EU may suit the likes of president Trump but will only endanger Europe. Speaking to Die Welt the chancellor candidate said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone flirting with the idea of Grexit risks breaking Europe apart. This may be in the interest of [US president] Donald Trump or [French National Front leader] Marine Le Pen, but it is certainly not in the interest of Germany and Europe. It is extremely dangerous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Across the board, MPs are interpreting Schulz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements as strong rebuke of Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble who has repeatedly suggested it would be better for Greece to leave the common currency. Hara Kafantari, who represents the governing Syriza party in parliament told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a very strong message to Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble that his [yearning] for Grexit could lead to the dismemberment of Europe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a message to the euro zone that it should sit and think seriously about which way it wants to go because policies right now are like shifting sands, no one knows what is going to happen from one day to the next. Europe has to decide whether it is going to move to the far right or return to the principles of democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has long been seen by Athens to play bad cop to chancellor Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good cop. On Friday the former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told this business blog: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit is a football being kicked around between Dr Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble and Mrs Merkel. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble is determined to kick Greece out and Merkel is determined not to make a decision until she really must.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US dollar has hit a two-week high against the Japanese yen this morning. One dollar was trading at \u00c2\u00a5114.1 yen at one point, up from \u00c2\u00a5113.1 on Friday night, partly thanks to relief that the Trump-Abe summit passed off without incident. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale puts it.. President Trump played golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with bonhomie replacing currency wars. That set the stage for a risk-friendly start to the week, with USD/JPY tracking higher and equities in a buoyant mood across Asia. But Juckes is also concerned that investors are putting too much faith in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of a major tax cut programme soon. So if the president doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver, there could be plenty of disappointment... The more dollar-positive and risk-friendly mood is rooted in the terrifying flakey earth of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise last week that he will announce something phenomenal on tax policy in the next two to three weeks. With soundbites coming so far ahead of details, markets are unable to avoid over-excitement but of course they (we) are vulnerable to disappointment if the detail doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live up to the expectations that grow so easily. In turn, that means market confidence is pretty fragile, too. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that investors are in a confident mood: Zing! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index has hit another all-time high. The index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, is up 0.2% this morning at 18,748 points. Some UK news - the troubled Co-operative Bank is up for sale, four years after being rescued by a group of hedge funds. Mining firms are leading the charge this morning, as traders bet that robust economic growth will keep commodity prices higher. Glencore, Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are all up over 2%. This has pushed London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 higher, and the mining sector to its highest since August 2014. Fears of a copper shortage are partly to blame, with workers at a BHP Billiton mine in Chile currently on strike. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the markets are looking for Donald Trump to deliver on his campaign pledges this month. Trump is, without doubt, a key theme of 2017, however, in the past week I have noticed a few changes in the way he is impacting financial markets. Firstly, the tweeter-in-chief might be losing some of his potency. The markets are starting to get used to his Twitter outbursts, and even after retailer Nordstrom was singled out for his ire last week, its shares actually rose after it received the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump treatment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Secondly, the markets are now focused on 28th February, when Trump will give his first State of the Union address to Congress and is expected to lay out his taxation and infrastructure plans. Big things are expected, infrastructure spending could the be the hardest to get past Congress, so if Trump rolls back on some of his spending rhetoric to try and win the support of Congress then the financial markets may not be so impressed. James Bevan of charity fund manager CCLA agrees that the Trump-Abe summit will have pleased investors: But Henry Croft of Accendo Markets sees geopolitical worries building: US equities continue to rally in expectation of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform and a successful two-day Japan-US summit in Washington. This optimism, however, is being offset by rising geopolitical concerns following North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful missile test on Sunday whilst a weaker Dollar in Asian trading weighs on the foreign earnings heavy FTSE 100. Global stock markets are rallying at the start of the week, driven by optimism that US president Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cutting plans will boost global growth. Relief that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe passed off pretty well over the weekend has also helped to push share prices higher in Asia. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has closed up 0.4% at a two-week high, while other Asian markets have hit their highest level in 18 months, as Reuters explains: MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3 percent, with resource-related stocks in Australia leading the gains. Markets in Taiwan and Singapore scaled their highest levels since mid-2015. These gains follow a record close on Wall Street on Friday night. Last week, Trump cheered investors by promising to announce a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax reform proposal within a few weeks - a challenging goal, but one that has cheered investors. The Trump-Abe meeting has also gone better than many observers feared -- despite the Japanese PM finding himself on the wrong end of one of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infamous handshakes: During the visit, Trump ticked some important diplomatic boxes by affirming Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy, and avoiding labelling Beijing a currency manipulator. Abe and Trump also agreed to discuss a bilateral trade deal - to fill the void created by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. North Korea cast a shadow over the event, of course, by testing a ballistic missile over the weekend. But that prompted Japan and the US to reaffirm their own ties.... Analysts reckon the meeting went pretty well. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This positive lead from the U.S. coupled with improving trade sentiment provides the backing for a positive Monday for Asian markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jingyi Pan of IG said in a report. The Trump-Abe meeting and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd commitment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could allay some of the trade concerns in Asia and set free into the market more bullish bets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it remains to be hashed out, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mention of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclevel playing field\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on currency valuation also appears to reflect an amicable turn after the U.S. president accused his visitors of currency manipulation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It feels like a cautious start to the week, with not much in the economic calendar. At 10am GMT, the European Commission issues its latest economic forecasts for the region. It may revise its growth forecasts upwards, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t derailed Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow recovery. Germany, meanwhile, has just released new wholesale inflation data, showing that prices jumped by 4% in the last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to fuel concerns that inflation is accelerating too rapidly for Berlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfort. Investors will also be watching events in Greece. Officials from its creditors are due back in Athens next week, in the hope of reaching a deal on its next bailout payment before February 20th. EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has called on all parties to finalise an agreement quickly, warning yesterday that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now is not the time to turn the clocks back to financial instability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Greek PM Alexis Tsipras insists that Athens will not cave in, declaring that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will not agree to demands that are not backed up by logic and numbers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So it could be a nervy week....",

Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations.</p> <p>At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the possible policy changes which could come from president Trump:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37857dabfbf7db783ef6cbc838a9c9b6d3e0b13e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37857dabfbf7db783ef6cbc838a9c9b6d3e0b13e/0_0_1025_575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellen testfies in Congress\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yellen testfies in Congress</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C-Span</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T15:22:19.044Z\">at 3.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58a31bc0e4b012eeb30c9cf2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T15:06:23.917Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US rate increase appropriate if economy is in line with forecasts - Yellen</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In her opening testimony to the senate, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said a rate increase would be appropriate at one of its forthcoming meetings if employment and inflation evolved in line with expectations.</p> <p>She said waiting too long to remove monetary policy accommodation would be unwise, and could require rapid, disruptive rate rises which could push the US economy into recession.</p> <p>As it stands gradual increases in rates would probably be appropriate.</p> <p>The jobs market is continuing to strengthen, and inflation is moving up to the 2% target.</p> <p>On Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal policy, she said changes could affect the economic outlook but it was too early to know how this would unfold.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a31767e4b09b65848eb83a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T14:44:56.661Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street edges lower ahead of Yellen testimony</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have dipped slightly as investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments to Congress, due to start shortly.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 13 points or 0.07% lower while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.15%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a31185e4b0fcbf4e7d5b29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T14:21:06.129Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Late last month, congressman Patrick McHenry wrote to Fed chair Janet Yellen calling on the central bank to stop negotiating agreements with other regulators.</p> <p>He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best interests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Now Reuters is reporting a reply from Yellen, saying such global negotiations benefit the US and the Fed has the authority and responsibility to consult with its foreign counterparts.</p> <p>Another topic for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing, no doubt.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a30f3de4b09b65848eb81c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T14:11:21.360Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Greece... farmers are holding protests against the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity-driven tax rises.</strong></p> <p>The group have reached Syntagma Square, site of the Athens parliament, chanting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bow your heads.

A failure to do so could see more pressure come on the US dollar going forward, with the hugely popular call before the turn of the year for a further appreciation in the buck in 2017 starting to look in need of a more hawkish Fed. </p> </blockquote> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the market is looking for three things: is the Fed still thinking about three rate hikes this year?

But it was below a forecast for 1.9% in a Reuters poll of economists, as falling clothes prices offset some of the upward pressure on inflation from fuel and food.</p> <p>The more modest than expected inflation reading bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates to keep price rises in check. Reflecting that view, the pound dipped. It had been above $1.25 against the dollar before the figures and fell to $1.2464 by late morning, down 0.5% on the day.</p> <p>However, economists say inflation will rise further this year, going through the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target within months. Fuelling the rise is the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which makes imports to the UK more expensive, and also the rise in oil prices on the back of lower production.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect headline inflation to break through the 2% target as early as February and keep rising to around 3% by autumn this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Oliver White, economist at Fathom Consulting.....</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>More here:</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/uk-inflation-rises-to-18-spurred-by-weak-pound-and-rising-fuel-costs\">UK inflation rises to 1.8% spurred by weak pound and rising fuel costs</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a308dfe4b09b65848eb7f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T13:54:12.297Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury</strong>, says the solution to higher inflation includes curbs on utility firms and a higher minimum wage:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further rise in inflation to its highest level since June 2014 shows that after seven wasted years of Tory spending cuts and failure to invest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working people that are being squeezed.

                "bodyText":"Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen opened the door to further US interest rate rises if the economy continued on track, telling US senators waiting too long to act would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The comments saw the dollar move higher, with analysts suggesting Yellen had been more hawkish than expected. Against a basket of currencies the US currency added 0.36%. But Yellen also warned that the economic outlook was uncertain, although she repeatedly refused to be drawn on what effect President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed policies would have on the economy. Yellen maintained bank lending had grown despite the Dodd Frank regulations designed to avoid a new financial crisis, prompting Senator Elizabeth Warren to say Trump and his advisors were wrong to think of rolling them back. But not everyone agreed that banks were lending as freely as was claimed. On immigration, Yellen said slowing the pace of immigration would slow economic growth. Here is our full report on the Yellen hearing, leading on the disagreements over Dodd Frank: Earlier, UK inflation rose at its fastest pace for two-and-a-half years but Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew more slowly than expected. And with that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Senator Chris Van Hollen asks about wage gowth. Yellen: Somewhat faster wage growth would be consistent with our inflation objective. Ultimately real wage growth is limited by productivity growth which is why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lamented it [productivity growth] has been so slow. I would like congress to focus on policies which would increase productivity... She adds that there are a number of areas which impact productivity, including policies which promote education, innovation etc. And with that the hearing is over. Senator John Kennedy asks about slow growth, and what blame the Fed has. Yellen: We have put in place a monetary policy to get economy growing at its potential. She says this has boosted employment but productivity needs to improve. Kennedy changes tack: If community banks did nothing in financial crisis why are they subject to Dodd Frank. Yellen says they are not subject to exactly the same rules and large parts of Dodd Frank do not apply to them. We have done our best to tailor our regulations so they are appropriate according to the risk. Kennedy: Does it bother you no one responsible for the financial crisis went to jail? Yellen: I think those who were accountable should have had appropriate punishment. It is up to the Justice Department to impose criminal sanctions and in many cases I understand they thought they could not get convictions. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto asks about the benefits of immigration, and the contribution for the economy given President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent orders. What impact would [Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves] have on our growth and competitiveness Yellen: Slowing the pace of immigration would probably slow growth. Masto: If the Mexican economy went into recession, what effect would that have on the US. Yellen: Our economies are closely tied, our developments here have a spillover flow to them and there could be flows in the opposite direction. Senator Dean Heller says he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there earlier so did Yellen say there might be a rate rise in March. Yellen (who suddenly and coincidentally has a small outbreak of coughing) tries to pay it straight and says: I indicated that at our coming meetings we will try to evaluate whether economy is progressing in line with expectations and if it is it will probably be appropriate to raise interest rates further. A gradual rise in rates is likely to be appropriate. Heller: Is it the same answer for an interest rate rise at the June meeting? Yellen: The economic outlook is uncertain, but in December we said a few interest rate rises would be appropriate this year. Every meeting is live. Heller: what effect would fiscal stimulus have? Yellen repeats it is too soon to know what these measures are, and fiscal policy is only one of many things we have to consider. Heller: what is better, tax cuts or spending. Yellen: a decision for Congress. Heller: Do you support a border tax. Yellen also brushes this off as a matter for Congress. [Nice try Senator Heller.] Senator Brian Schatz asks about climate change. To what extent does Fed take this into account in assessing risks. Yellen: In monetary policy our forecasts do not go out so far that climate change would affect economy. If have a hurricane etc, that may have impact we take into account. Schatz: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to disagree. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case any more. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about severe weather in 15 years, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened in the last few years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s having a material impact on the economy now. Yellen: Various economic fora are looking into effects of climate change on economy. We recognise that risk events such as severe weather could have effects on the financial system. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been trying to build resilience so financial companies can deal with risk events. Senator Thom Tillis: On bank lending, there is other research [from that quoted by Yellen earlier] showing a decrease in the amount of loans post-crisis. Is it possible that far fewer people are actually asking for loans. Yellen: I think that is true and a lot of small businesses say growth does not justify significant expansion plans. Tillis: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it problematic to make us think only a small number are not getting loans. I think there is pent up demand. Yellen: Sometimes small businesses borrow against homes etc, so because there was a reduction in residential property values [there was less ability to borrow] Our objective is for banks to lend, safe and sound loans. Tillis: on one hand we say banks can lend to anyone, then say you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lend outside these narrow parameters. [Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say] anyone can borrow. The Dodd Frank bill expanded into [a huge amount of regulations]. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good graphic from ING Bank on Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Senator Tim Scott talks about ways to mitigate regulatory burden for smaller banks. Yellen says this is important. Congress might want to except community banks from some of the provisions. Senator Elizabeth Warren brings up the Trump plan to row back on the Dodd-Frank regulations on banks. She says Trump said Dodd Frank was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disaster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and banks were not lending, and wants Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. Yellen says lending has grown, It exceeds its 2008 peak, and the same is true of total loans held by banks. We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy. Over half of small businesses in a survey said they did not need to borrow. Warren: So the data do not back up the President. Warren than asks about comments that banks have having to hoard capital. Does this prevent banks lending? Yellen says its not a requirement that they take the money and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it, the capital is used to make loans. Warren asks how US banks have done in comparison to foreign competitors since Dodd-Franks. Yellen says she believes our banks are more profitable, are capturing market share from European banks, are well capitalised and seen as safe and strong. Warren says if we are considering changing regulations, we need to start with facts and these show Trump and his advisors are wrong on every reason they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given for tearing up Dodd Franks. We did this kind of [lack of] regulation before and it resulted in the worst financial crisis since the great depression. Senator Tom Cotton says wage growth has been largely stagnant over the last few years although there have been some signs of increase. Yellen says wage growth depends on productivity growth, which has been relatively depressed in recent years. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen much higher wage growth for skilled workers, compared to less skilled. Wage growth has picked up somewhat [as the labour market gets tighter]. We have put in place conditions intended to lower unemployment rate.. and the labour market has in a general sense started to improve. As Yellen continues, Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, believes her comments on interest rates were stronger than expected: Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone to the newly elected Congress was definitely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ballsy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it suggest that she will maintain the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence, and will stand her ground when it comes to any risks that the Trump administration may (or may not) pose to financial and economic stability in the US. She was a touch more hawkish than expected, which, when combined with comments from non-voter Lacker who said that the case is building for a rate hike in March, boosted the dollar, weighed on equities and on bonds... Watch out for who Trump picks to fill the vacant spots on the Fed. Yellen called for diversity, but if Trump fills those spots with people akin to his own world view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c low rates and lower dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then the path of Fed policy could change sharply going forward. Back with senator Shelby who asks about the trade imbalance and the long term effects. Yellen says the current account deficit on goods and services has increased, it leads to a build up in our endebtedness to foreigners so it is a long term concern. It is currently close to $500bn a year. Whether it is troubling depends on what the long term trends are. Toomey ends by calling for the Fed not to make any new regulations until the new members of the Fed are appointed. Senator Pat Toomey asks about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecast. He says the new President committed to tax reform, rollback of regulation, an infrastructure spending bill and people believed that would give stronger economic growth, with equities rising. Yet the December Fed meeting had no change in their opinion for the prospects for economic growth. It looks like the Fed believes these things will either not happen or are not pro-growth. Yellen says we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet have clarity. Most of my colleagues decided not to speculate on the economic policy changes and their consequences. Some said they assumed there would be a mild fiscal stimulus, but most decided we wanted more clarity before incorporating them into our forecasts. Asked about consumer lending, Yellen says it is critical to monitor for abuses in consumer lending, and says she wishes the Fed had been more active previously. Senator Bob Menendez asks about the plans to repeal Obamacare and its effects on the economy. Yellen says we would have to look at the effect, a loss of access to health insurance could have an impact on household spending and on the economy. Access to healthcare has likely improved people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobility, and losing this could have implications for job mobility. Senator Bob Corker asks about future policy changes (from the government) and their effect on the economy (referring to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to boost infrastructure spending, tax reforms etc). Yellen says: We recognise there may be significant economic policy changes and they could affect outlook. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet have enought clarity on what changes will be put in place to factor them in. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to base current policy on speculation on what may come down the line. [Policy changes] could affect monetary policy but it depends on what they are and the timing. We will certainly pay attention to it. Some of the policiies being discussed may raise the deficit and have an effect on economic growth. But I would say fiscal sustainability has been a long standing problem. Reed asks about cyber security and how important it is for companies to have expertise. Yellen says cyber security is a major major risk that financial firms face. Boards are aware and appreciate the seriousness of the risk. But it is very important for boards to have appropriate expertise. Senator Jack Reed asks about Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rule for setting interest rates and what effect that would have. Yellen says: Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rule would call for a rate between 3.5 to 4%, higher than current Fed rate. I believe we would have a weaker economy if we had followed the dictates of that rule. Senator Richard Shelby asks about the three forthcoming openings at the Fed, and whether Yellen will see out her term which ends early next year. Yellen says firmly: I do intend to complete my term as chair. On the three forthcoming new members, Yellen says the role of the chair is to work constructively with all the governors. On removing rules and regulations - including Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive order calling for removing two existing rules for every new one - Yellen says independent agencies are not bound by this. Yellen finishes her prepared remarks. Now the questions. Senator Sherrod Brown asks whether banks are not lending (something members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration have suggested) Yellen says only 2% of small businesses said in a survey they could not get the lending they needed. Brown: So just because people in high places say it, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it so. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Yellen largely maintained the same tone seen in the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s January meeting, claiming that a rate hike would be appropriate if inflation and wage growth matches the its current expectations, while hinting that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal policies could change the course of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 journey. Differing views about an imminent US rate rise. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief US economist says: But: Here is Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening statement in full. On interest rates, Yellen said: As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate. On the possible policy changes which could come from president Trump: That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In her opening testimony to the senate, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said a rate increase would be appropriate at one of its forthcoming meetings if employment and inflation evolved in line with expectations. She said waiting too long to remove monetary policy accommodation would be unwise, and could require rapid, disruptive rate rises which could push the US economy into recession. As it stands gradual increases in rates would probably be appropriate. The jobs market is continuing to strengthen, and inflation is moving up to the 2% target. On Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal policy, she said changes could affect the economic outlook but it was too early to know how this would unfold. US markets have dipped slightly as investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments to Congress, due to start shortly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 13 points or 0.07% lower while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.15%. Late last month, congressman Patrick McHenry wrote to Fed chair Janet Yellen calling on the central bank to stop negotiating agreements with other regulators. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best interests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now Reuters is reporting a reply from Yellen, saying such global negotiations benefit the US and the Fed has the authority and responsibility to consult with its foreign counterparts. Another topic for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing, no doubt. Over in Greece... farmers are holding protests against the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity-driven tax rises. The group have reached Syntagma Square, site of the Athens parliament, chanting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bow your heads. The only way forward is organisation and struggle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lambros Papaconstantinou, a farmer from Karditsa, told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are determined to go to the end because there is no other way. How can we survive when 70 percent of our earnings go on taxes, fuel costs, social contributions?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And ahead of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony: Michael Flynn may have hit the headlines by resigning as President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security advisor, but markets are more likely to be focused on a testimony to the Senate later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The Fed has indicated it could raise US rates three times this year, so any hints from Yellen in this direction - and whether the first increase will come in March - will be keenly watched. With Trump previously criticising the Fed for its low interest rate policy, her views on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans could also form part of the questioning. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: The last meeting of the US central bank saw monetary policy kept on hold, with little alteration made on the previous statement. With forward guidance implying that the rate-setting body believe there will be three rate hikes this year, the market is once more predicting a more dovish path. With an approximately 35% chance currently being given for a March hike, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech could provide an opportunity for Ms. Yellen to show that she is serious in making significant progress in the normalisation of monetary policy before her term expires next year. A failure to do so could see more pressure come on the US dollar going forward, with the hugely popular call before the turn of the year for a further appreciation in the buck in 2017 starting to look in need of a more hawkish Fed. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: Overall, the market is looking for three things: is the Fed still thinking about three rate hikes this year? Has anything occurred that could de-rail this expectation? Will Yellen give the markets a reality check by voicing some scepticism about potential fiscal change under President Trump? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: UK inflation climbed to 1.8% in January, driven by a jump in fuel prices, while the weak pound and rising oil price sent costs for firms soaring. The Office for National Statistics said inflation was at its highest level since June 2014 and followed a reading of 1.6% in December. But it was below a forecast for 1.9% in a Reuters poll of economists, as falling clothes prices offset some of the upward pressure on inflation from fuel and food. The more modest than expected inflation reading bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates to keep price rises in check. Reflecting that view, the pound dipped. It had been above $1.25 against the dollar before the figures and fell to $1.2464 by late morning, down 0.5% on the day. However, economists say inflation will rise further this year, going through the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target within months. Fuelling the rise is the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which makes imports to the UK more expensive, and also the rise in oil prices on the back of lower production. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect headline inflation to break through the 2% target as early as February and keep rising to around 3% by autumn this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Oliver White, economist at Fathom Consulting..... More here: Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says the solution to higher inflation includes curbs on utility firms and a higher minimum wage: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further rise in inflation to its highest level since June 2014 shows that after seven wasted years of Tory spending cuts and failure to invest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working people that are being squeezed. With shocking increases in the price of household utilities announced last week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for this government to get tough on the profiteers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only Labour will take the firm action needed to end the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rigged economy, by taking action to tackle gas and electricity price rises, bringing the railways back into public ownership to end the ticket price rip-off, and bringing in a \u00c2\u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rising inflationary pressures may drive more manufacturers into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshrink-flation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, where they discretely trim the size of their products but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the price. James Brown from pricing expert Simon-Kucher explains: We expect to see fewer or lighter promotions, and smaller or lighter products on the shelves over the coming months. The implication for shoppers is that we end up paying more for the same. Take Quality Street tins, for example, which have been getting steadily slimmer as the years go by: But the ONS won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled. They have an army of trained price collectors, who scour the shops to check prices, and also keep tabs on whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting less for our money. Katie Allen took a trip with one \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinflation food soldier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her report: James Wells of the the ONS points out that Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only country facing higher prices. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate jumped to 1.9% last month..... Both countries will have been hit by the jump in oil prices over the last year. But monetarists, such as Tim Goldsmith, blame central banks for creating too much money.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also had some disappointing economic data from the eurozone this morning. The single currency bloc only grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2016, not the punchier 0.5% that was initially estimated last month. Eurostat, the statistics body, has revised down its figures following weaker-than-expected growth figures from Germany (0.4%) and Italy (0.2%) this morning. And in another blow...Greece is shrinking again. New figures show that its GDP shrank by 0.4% in October-December. The cost of living squeeze is already forcing some families to seek help handing their debts, warns the Money Advice Trust. Jane Tully, director of external affairs, fears that rising inflation will drag more people into difficulties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Household budgets are being chipped away by this new squeeze on personal finances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many people who are only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust about managing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk falling into problem debt as a result. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Demand for debt advice is already surging this year, and this demand is likely to continue to grow as the squeeze continues. Rising inflation and high levels of household borrowing mean that it has never been more important for government, advice agencies and lenders to work together to make sure people get the help they need. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone struggling to cope should seek free advice from a charity-run service like National Debtline as soon as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are two main factors that drove Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate jumped from 1.6% to 1.8% last month -- fuel costs surged, and the long run of falling food prices is levelling out. The ONS says that: Transport: prices, overall, fell by 0.6% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 2.5% a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from motor fuels, with prices rising by 3.4% between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 2.6% a year earlier. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: Food prices were unchanged between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 0.6% a year ago. Following a sustained period of deflation of food prices since mid-2014, during which the 12-month rate was often lower than negative 3.0%, the rate has increased for 4 consecutive months, reaching negative 0.4% in January 2017. This is the highest it has been since June 2014. But...this was partly countered by cheaper clothing costs, thanks to the post-Christmas sales. The ONS explains that: Clothing and footwear: the downward effect was due to prices for a wide range of items of clothing and footwear. Overall, prices fell by 4.2% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a smaller fall of 3.1% last year. Sales patterns may have contributed to this, as the proportion of items on sale increased by more between December 2016 and January 2017 than it did a year ago. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for readers worrying about inflation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Brex-effect is starting to bite into our wallets and put extra pressure on our household budgets. With the cost of fuel shooting up there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been a better time to rethink your travel arrangements. Now might be the time to look at car sharing, cycling or at least clearing out your boot to make your driving more economical. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This news will hurt anyone with savings; if your account isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying you at least 1.8% your money will be losing buying power. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let your bank keep your hard earned cash without giving you a decent return; use savings to pay off expensive debts or get a high interest current account.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How high could inflation go this year? Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, reckons it could spike to 3% - well over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target (and probably exceeding many people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rises). He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trend is clearly towards higher inflation, however, and we should expect the rate of price increases to rise above the 2% Bank of England target in the next few months. By the end of this year, inflation is likely to be around 3pc and possibly even higher. Rising energy prices and the weakness of the pound are the main factors behind this expected increase. Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only economy facing higher inflation, points out Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising inflation is not just a UK phenomenon and is not just currency-related. Prices are rising across the West, as higher fuel and other commodity prices feed through to consumers. In fact, German prices have risen faster than UK prices in the last year and last month Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate was higher than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [at 1.9%].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade is one reason that world stock markets are climbing, with Wall Street hitting record highs again last night. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is very concerned that inflation is going to take a big chunk out of workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings - particularly public sector workers, whose pay rises are capped at 1%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing working people need is another pay squeeze. But prices are shooting up and real wage growth is stalling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another living standards crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c families still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recovered from the last one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This should include ending the current pay restrictions on nurses, teachers and other public servants.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jeremy Cook of World First is in the Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that inflation will overtake wage rises this year - meaning real incomes will start falling again. He points to the surge in the cost of imported raw materials: Sterling has fallen around 12% on a trade-weighted basis since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, and as a result producers are facing sharply higher input costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 20.5% on a year earlier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost unthinkable that cost increases of this magnitude can be fully absorbed, leaving firms with little choice but to pass at least some of the burden onto consumers. By the end of the year price inflation looks set to outstrip wage growth, which will squeeze household budgets in the short term. Good grief! The prices paid by UK manufacturers for imported raw materials and fuel jumped by 20% in January, compared to a year earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely due to the fall in sterling (down 13%), and and the higher cost of crude oil (up 82% year-on-year). Factories are now passing some of this cost onto their customers. Output prices rose by 3.5%, which is likely to push consumer price inflation up in the months ahead. This jump in inflation shows that Britain is now suffering the impact of the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, who believes the cost of living will keep climbing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fall in the pound is really starting to stoke inflation as the rising cost of imports bites. A sharp rise in UK CPI now sees inflation within a whisker of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Sterling weakness has continued to push fuel and food prices higher, resulting in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI reading of 1.8%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Britain seemingly heading for a hard Brexit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely we will see the pound continue to wobble over the next two years, resulting in higher inflation in the short term. Indeed, price rises are expected to reach 2.8% by the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation forecast to exceed the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target this year, still slow wage growth and Mark Carney showing no intention of raising rates any time soon, millions of households will begin to feel the financial squeeze in their pockets. Rising prices and relatively stagnant incomes are a painful combination. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in inflation will leave many people worrying that their disposable income is shrinking, especially if their pay isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising at a similar rate. The Treasury admits that this is a worry, with a spokesperson saying that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment has reached record levels and earnings have risen faster than inflation for more than 2 years. The government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living and that is why we are cutting taxes for millions of working people and have frozen fuel duty, saving an average driver \u00c2\u00a3130 a year compared to previous plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar since the inflation figures came out, to $1.247. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because City economists had expected an even sharper rise in inflation, to 1.9%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate is being driven up by the rising cost of motor fuels, says the Office for National Statistics. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the oil price has risen sharply over the last year, from $33 per barrel to around $55 today. Food prices also had an upward impact on the cost of living in January. But clothing and footwear prices fell by more than a year ago. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI inflation rate is now at its highest level since June 2014: Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 1.8% in January, up from 1.6% in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takes the Consumer Prices Index closer to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, and suggests that the weak pound is continuing to drive up the cost of living. More to follow! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the latest UK inflation figures, which will show how the cost of living increased in January. In the meantime, market research firm GfK has just reported that 34% of people expect future consumer price increases will happen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more rapidly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than the past 12 months. This is more than three times as many as the 11% that thought this in January 2016. Joe Staton, Head of Market Dynamics at GfK, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fall in the value of the Pound since the Brexit vote has fuelled speculation among both business leaders and consumers alike that we will see accelerated price inflation filter through to the High Street this year. Consumers have already been hit by higher food and energy prices because the weakness of sterling is raising prices and reducing consumer spending power. This has affected a range of typical purchases from Marmite to Majorca summer holidays. This chart, from economist Rupert Seggins, shows how the pound (in red) has weakened since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are out...and, like Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re weaker than hoped. The Italian economy (rarely the most vigorous of beasts) expanded by a meagre 0.2% in the last thee months of 2016. Some economists had hoped Italy might hit the dizzy heights of 0.3% growth, which would still have been below the euro average. Back to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures...and the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has slowed. Dutch GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, a decent-enough number, but rather slower than the 0.8% growth recorded in July-September. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in Tokyo this morning, where Toshiba has revealed it is taking a $6.3bn writedown on its troubled nuclear power division, and announced that its chairman is stepping down. Toshiba has also been forced to delay the publication of its latest earnings report, as it tries to assess the full damage following its mishandled purchase of a US construction firm. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Commerzbank analyst Joerg Kraemer argues that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still in good shape, even though growth missed forecasts in the last quarter. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fourth quarter was not as strong as most economists had expected, but sentiment surveys rose sharply in the past months and orders are also pointing upward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore growth could slightly pick up in the first quarter of 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historic day for Rolls-Royce, for the wrong reasons. The engine-maker has reported its biggest ever loss, a whopping \u00c2\u00a34.6bn, this morning, due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3671m fine for bribery. CEO Warren East argued that Rolls is making good progress with its cost-cutting programme. But the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, sending its shares down 3% in early trading.... In another blow to the eurozone, Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is shrinking again. Finnish GDP contracted by 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, new figures show, wiping out the 0.4% growth in July-September. Austerity, the demise of Nokia, and the sanctions imposed on Russia have all hurt Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy; today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show its economy is only 0.2% larger than a year ago. Frederik Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet fears that Germany could drag the overall eurozone growth rate down, from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimate of 0.5% in Q4. Holger Zschaepitz of Welt points out that net trade had a negative impact on German growth (because imports grew faster than exports) Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perform as well as hoped in the final three months of last year. New figures show that German GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December period, weaker than the 0.5% which economists had predicted. That means Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpowerhouse economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lagged behind the UK, which grew by 0.6% in the same period. In a double-whammy, German growth in the third quarter of 2016 has been revised down too, from +0.2% to just 0.1%. German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office says that foreign trade held back growth in the last three months of the year, with imports growing much faster than exports. But growth was supported by government spending, and a small pick-up in consumer spending too. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots on the agenda today. For starters, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting growth figures from Germany (out now) and Italy (9am GMT) for the last three months of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followed by a new estimate for eurozone GDP at 10am. Then at 9.30am it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest UK inflation data, which is likely to show another jump in the cost of living. Economists expect that inflation rose by around 1.9% in January, up from 1.6% in December. On the corporate front, engine maker Rolls-Royce is reporting results for the first time since it took a \u00c2\u00a3671m fine to settle bribery claims. Then this afternoon, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress, from 3pm GMT. She can expect questions on the state of the US economy, president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans, and the prospect of interest rate rises soon. Some on Wall Street reckon the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage its target of three hikes this year, so Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments could move the dollar. RBC Capital Markets say: Given the uncertainty of timing on the fiscal agenda and the relatively modest uptick in inflation thus far this year, we think it will be difficult for the committee to get enough members onboard for a hike in March (not to mention that the French election in late April/early May looms large as a potential catalyst for global volatility). But Yellen could certainly move the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perception\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd needle on this. There may be drama in Greece; hundreds of farmers are expected to protest against the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity measure in Athens today.",

It would carry environmental risks and impose significant financial costs on the Bank, and thereby the taxpayer, and on the cash industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A row broke out about the new plastic \u00c2\u00a35 banknotes last November, after it emerged that they contained tallow, an animal byproduct of beef or mutton fat. A petition urging the Bank to stop using the substance in its banknotes attracted nearly 135,000 signatures. It said the use of animal fat was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unacceptable to millions of vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A vegetarian cafe in Cambridge stopped taking the \u00c2\u00a35 note, and some Hindu temples in the UK also banned it. Satish K Sharma, general secretary of the National Council of Hindu Temples, said he was surprised that the Bank decided to push ahead with production of the \u00c2\u00a310 note after his meeting with the chief cashier, Victoria Cleland, in January. He described it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with temples, as charities, relying on financial donations. Sharma branded the new banknotes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153means of exchange which is contrary to the principle of non-violence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He explained that while people could choose not to eat meat, a currency made with animal fat left no choice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being imposed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loss of a religious and moral and ethical freedom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the council would be seeking legal advice. The Bank said it had carefully considered other options, such as destroying, reprinting and delaying the issue of the \u00c2\u00a310 note, but concluded it would be too costly. It is looking at switching to an alternative substance, such as palm oil or coconut oil, for the planned \u00c2\u00a320 polymer note and the next batch of \u00c2\u00a35 notes, but the switch would come too late for the new plastic tenner. The Bank said it had already printed 275m \u00c2\u00a310 notes, at a cost of \u00c2\u00a324m, in preparation for their launch in the autumn (it plans to print 1.2bn notes in total ). It has also spent \u00c2\u00a346m printing the 440m plastic \u00c2\u00a35 notes. Reprinting these notes would mean incurring these costs again, and there would be a further \u00c2\u00a350,000 cost for the secure destruction of the existing stock. The central bank said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank works hard to ensure that the public has enough secure notes to use in daily life and destroying the hundreds of millions of notes already printed would put this at risk. The Bank cannot guarantee sufficient stocks of paper notes to replace the destroyed polymer notes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After careful consideration the Bank has concluded that the severity of the combined impact of the factors outlined outweigh potential harm caused.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The flexible plastic film for the banknotes is made by Innovia in Wigton, Cumbria, and they are printed by De La Rue in Essex. The Bank said it had not known tallow would be used to make the \u00c2\u00a35 and \u00c2\u00a310 notes when it signed the contract with Innovia. It has postponed signing a contract for the production of the plastic \u00c2\u00a320 note, which is to be issued by 2020, and has spoken to Innovia and other polymer suppliers about making it with a plant-based alternative. Suppliers have said it should not affect the quality of the banknotes, though this would still need be tested in production trials in coming months. The Vegan Society said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfortunate that the new \u00c2\u00a310 note will contain tallow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have met with the Bank of England and believe they are committed to solving this problem and we will continue to work with them to find a good solution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We look forward to the consultation around the \u00c2\u00a320 note and hope that any future bank notes will be free from ingredients produced through harming animals. We hope that other companies will follow this positive example and review the use of animals in their products.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

On that note it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has completed a flying visit to Athens on an upbeat note saying the impasse between Greece and its creditors can soon be resolved. Helena Smith reports: Emerging from a series of back-to-back meetings in Athens, the French commissioner expressed optimism that friction over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout review would be resolved although the likelihood of that happening by February 20 when euro zone finance ministers next meet is almost impossible. Following talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Moscovici emphasized the need for Greeks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to see a light at the end of the austerity tunnel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier he had told reporters after a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very constructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 30-minute meeting with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place was at the heart of the euro zone. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe fiscal targets can be met and overachieved\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the will to go to a solution is there \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and where there is a will there is a way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But despite the upbeat tone, Moscovici also insisted on the need for reform and said efforts were required \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from all sides.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That a compromise will come in the form of Greece accepting to implement additional austerity, however, is far from assured. Tsipras took to twitter to welcome Moscovici insisting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the time has come to recognise all the sacrifices of the Greek people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can talk about reforms but enough with austerity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sure the European Commission will be an important partner in the alliance of logic that we need today in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd To break the impasse that has arisen over demands Athens adopts further austerity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in addition to the painful measures it has already enforced and committed to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c insiders say the leftist-led government is holding out for a multi-layered compromise agreement. In exchange for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.6bn worth of extra cuts (not least the lowering of the tax threshold) it wants guaranteed trade-offs such as a debt relief road map, the promise of participation in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme and a lower primary surplus target. Yellen is asked that, if there is success in deporting all the undocumented immigrants, what would be the impact on economy. Yellen says: Immigration has been an important part of labour force growth in the US for some time. One factor responsible for slowing growth is slower labour force growth and a radical change in immigration would certainly effect the potential of the economy to grow. US markets continue to hold onto most of their gains following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and regulation comments. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Bang on cue, and no doubt with an eye to outshine Janet Yellen, Donald Trump offered a tantalising foretaste of planned tax reforms that sent the Dow soaring to new record highs. The DJIA just bounced off 20,604 level after the president said he will greatly reduce taxes. Markets are taking this as the fodder they need for a fresh pop higher. He was short on details but based on what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far from this radical president there is no reason to think that the tax plans will be anything less than a major shift in US fiscal policy. Major pro-business tax reform has been on the cards but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments reiterate the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intentions. Asked about border adjustment tax and its effect on the economy, Yellen says I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think its appropriate for me to weigh in on specifics on this policy. On regulation, Yellen says the Fed is concerned about regulatory burden and if that was not clear she wants to clarify it. (There has been a lot of talk about Dodd Frank and the regulations which were put in place to try and improve the banking system after the financial crisis, with some senators calling for their removal a la Trump and some saying they have protected investors. Yellen is not keen on rolling back on Dodd Frank but clearly feels the need to avoid being seen as putting unnecessary burdens on business.) Back with Yellen and she is asked about her potential relationship with the new Treasury secretary, the ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin. She says she looks forward to a strong working relationship with Mnuchin. US markets seem to be reacting more to Trump than Yellen: Senator McHenry, who wrote to Yellen calling on the Fed to halt talks over international agreements about banking regulations until President Donald Trump has a chance to review their work and replace top negotiators, repeats his question. Yellen: Nothing is a rule that is effective in US until regulatory agencies have gone through the normal rule making process. Nothing binds the Fed to carry out agreements in our our rule making in US. In some cases we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with the outcomes and have no intention of putting [them] in place. He asks if the Fed will wait for the new regulators to be in place, and takes from Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reply that the answer is no. Back with Yellen, and the questions seem more directly political and partisan than a day earlier, with some interruptions when the Fed chair is answering: Meanwhile President Trump is talking again about chopping regulations and his tax reforms: Away from Yellen, and US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, as did gasoline inventories. Crude stocks rose by 9.5m barrels compared to analyst forecasts of a 3.5m increase. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.8m barrels, better than the 752,000 drop expected. After various comments and questions on Dodd Frank as per Tuesday, next up is Senator Barr who asks what the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serial failure of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts on the economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tells us about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy. Yellen says the Fed focuses on maximising unemployment not economic growth. Economic growth is disappointing but unemployment has come down substantially. We are close to meeting our labour market goals. The reason [for the growth performance] is that productivity growth in the US economy has been disappointing. (Much as she said on Tuesday) Janet Yellen has begun her second day of testimony, and is giving the same opening remarks as on Tuesday, pointing to a US rate hike before long. With US inflation and retail sales pointing to an interest rate rise - which could dampen earnings at American companies - investors are playing it cautiously at the start of US trading and ahead of Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest testimony. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 20 points or 0.1% but the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.09% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.07%. More US data, showing industrial production unexpectedly fell in January. Warm weather meant a drop in output from utilities, offsetting rises in manufacturing and mining. So the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial production index dipped 0.3% compared to expectations that it would remain flat. In December the index showed a rise of 0.6%, itself marked down from an initial reading of 0.8%. (The above shows the December figure before the revision) A reminder that Fed chair Janet Yellen will be up before the financial services committee of the House of Representatives in just under an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Rob Carnell at ING Bank reckons the figures mean the Fed is now more likely to raise rates at its next meeting in March: Whilst headline inflation gains can be put down to the impact of helpful base effects, the rise in the core rate, coupled with a better trend in wages growth, sends a clear message that the US economy is now running a little hot, the labour market is tight, and the time for inaction and caution from the Fed is over. Janet Yellen sounded a little more hawkish in her Senate testimony, and that got markets toying again with the idea of a March rate hike. But the data is now doing her work for her, and should push expectations further in this direction. The conclusion we reach from the inflation data is supported also by activity data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the form of a further strong retail sales figure...The probability of a March Fed hike implied from the Fed funds curve is 42%. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much more of a push for a March hike to become the market base case. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to the surge in the cost of living in America. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures showed inflation climbed to a five-year high, with the US economy continuing to walk down the same path that led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under the current levels of inflationary pressure, all eyes will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen, with investors pencilling in March for the first rate hike of a possible three. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, uncertainty continues to plague the political landscape, and Yellen will seek further clarity of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies before making a decision when they convene next month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested on Tuesday that interest rate rises would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the US economy carries on as expected, and this new data can only confirm that belief. (Yellen is due to give the second part of her testimony later but it is likely to be much the same as the previous session.) Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen has indicated that interest rate rises are very much in her plans for the US economy in the year ahead, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data will only serve to underline her stance. Inflation sailed past the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two per cent target and with economic growth expected to tighten, Yellen may well intervene on multiple occasions in the coming months. The question many investors will be grappling with is when, and not if, rates rise. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Yellen did not provide an explicit timeline in relation to interest rate hike and she is not going to do that today as well. Her job in these events is to manage the market expectations for any future interest rate... However, the CPI data released today has increased more pressure on her and she will be quizzed more intensively. Having said that, we anticipate that the Fed will be able to fire another bullet during the next quarter (when it comes to the interest rate). Yes, sturdy growth and eroding slack in the jobs market are validating the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts, but the wild card is still the Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and tax plans. The Fed has removed the reference to transitory energy factors from their statement, and for us, it sends the signal that they are confident in achieving their mandate inflation target. But there were some worse than expected outcomes in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: Boom! Two pieces of US economic data have just hit the wires and moved the markets. The big news is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has hit a four-year high last month, jumping from 2.1% to 2.5%. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.6% - twice as fast as expected - as households paid more for petrol (oh ok, gasoline) and food. Retail sales have also smashed forecasts, growing by 0.4% last month - or 0.8% if you exclude automobile sales. Investors are betting that this data puts more pressure on the US central bank to raise interest rates in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driven up the yield, or interest rates, on US 10-year government bonds. The dollar is also surging, sending the pound reeling to just $1.238 - down almost a whole cent today. But there is a fly in the soup -- average weekly earnings paid to US private workers fell by 0.4% in January. As in Britain, employees aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting the full benefits of the recovery..... Nick Macpherson, former top civil servant at the Treasury, makes an interesting point about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report -- there are now more job vacancies than people claiming jobless benefit. According to the ONS, there were 751,000 job vacancies for the 3 months to January 2017, while 745,000 people claimed unemployment related benefits in January. The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Bird has helpfully plotted both sets of data for us: There is a caveat (as ever...). Advertising job vacancies is cheaper than in the past, thanks to the internet, so employees may be tempted to speculatively offer positions and see who applies. But this could reinforce the point about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market approaching full capacity. But if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really true, why aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wages accelerating as workers flex their muscles and threaten to walk? One argument is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more slack in the system than the figures suggest (this is the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument for not raising interest rates). Another is that the traditional relationship between pay and unemployment has broken down since the financial crisis - which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well for wage rises this year.... The slowdown in real pay growth is causing concern in business, as well as in Westminster -- and prompting calls for government action. Even the CBI, whose members are in a decent position to raise salaries among the ranks, are worried. Rachel Smith, their principal labour market economist, argues that productivity (a long-running problem in Britain) needs to improve. And she singles out business rates as a big concern. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pay growth remains stubbornly sluggish, which is a concern given rising inflation. There are tentative signs that productivity is picking up, but there is further to go before it can underpin faster wage growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies will be looking to the Budget to see adjustments to business rates along with measures to boost educational performance, helping firms to drive faster productivity growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rates paid by many businesses are going up sharply in the next few years, with the City of London facing a \u00c2\u00a31.4bn bill. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to leave less money for pay rises. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams is also sounding the alarm on living standards: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the overall increase in employment but are concerned that wide regional differences in the numbers of people in work remain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also worrying to see that rising living costs are quickly catching up with wage growth. If this trend continues, the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abysmal record on living standards will get even worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Joseph Rowntree Foundation have seized on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage figures to hammer home their warning that millions more people risk being dragged into poverty by rising inflation. JRF says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Record employment in the economy is welcome and work has to be the best route out of poverty. But we know employment alone will not always help people reach a decent standard of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis today shows four million more people over the last six years have fallen below a decent leaving standard, meaning they are struggling to make ends meet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tackling the high cost of living is crucial to helping just managing families, particularly with a challenging outlook: inflation is likely to average 2.6% this year, in sharp contrast to the very low inflation of recent times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Government focus on modest incomes is welcome, but there is a fine margin between just managing today and poverty tomorrow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JRF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on the millions of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJust about managing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 families who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t earn enough for a decent standard of living has caused quite a stir today. It shows that some 30% of the population, or 19 million people, are living below the nationally-recognised minimum income standard (MIS) -- defined as having enough money to afford adequate housing, food and clothes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our take: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School: Sam Tombs, economist at Pantheon, flags up that employment growth has slowed. As mentioned earlier, the UK created another 37,000 jobs in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest performance since the second quarter of 2015. This chart, from Eshe Nelson of Quartz, shows how real wage growth has slowed as inflation (in purple) catches up with earnings growth (in blue). Real wages are only growing if the blue line is above the purple one -- something that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen between 2010 and 2014. There could be serious implications for the UK economy if inflation keeps biting into wages, taking real wage growth below today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year low. A real pay squeeze could hurt consumer spending, which has been driving growth since the EU referendum. Andrew Sentance, senior economic advisor of PwC, explains: With wage growth relatively subdued and consumer price inflation now up to 1.8% and set to rise further towards 3% by the end of 2017, the healthy real earnings growth we saw in 2015 and most of 2016 could soon be a thing of the past. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is likely to take the edge off consumer spending growth later this year and into 2018, which has been the main source of resilience in the UK economy since the Brexit vote. Gerwyn Davies, Labour Market Adviser at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, is concerned by the fall in real wage growth: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The record number of people in employment is, of course, good news. However there are a number of underlying factors that remain problematic, for example the fall in real wage growth from 1.7% to 1.4% over the last three months. This is especially concerning given the prospect of rising inflation in 2017. Davies is also struck by the drop in EU nationals working in Britain (see 9.57am post). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the EU referendum result is now having an impact on the economy, he agues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The figures also offer further evidence that Brexit has had a discernable impact on the allure of the UK as a place to live and work. The sharp growth in the number of non-UK nationals from the EU in work in the UK ground to a sudden halt in the second half of the year and has actually fallen in the last quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, employers in sectors that employ relatively large numbers of EU nationals, which also account for a sizeable proportion of vacancies, are likely to come under further recruitment pressures if, as we expect, this trend continues. As our Labour Market Outlook showed, the demand for labour is likely to remain strong in the near-term, which is reflected by the high number of vacancies reported in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 These charts from Resolution also show how real earnings growth has slowed.... ...and how the average worker has never reclaimed the pay growth lost in the financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation has bad news for UK workers -- they think the squeeze on wages will continue this year. With inflation set to keep rising, real pay rises will be dragged below the 1.4% reported today. Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest pay projection show that real pay growth is set to fall to around 1 per cent next month, less than half the pre-crisis average of 2.2 per cent. Laura Gardiner, Senior Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show the jobs market remains robust, with employment reaching a new record high and inactivity starting to fall again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the encouraging news on jobs isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeding through into earnings, which have shown no sign of responding to fast-rising inflation. Unless this changes Britain is set for a fresh pay squeeze later this year. This chart shows their latest forecasts: Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at The Work Foundation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c part of Lancaster University - also fears that wages are being squeezed by the rising cost of living. He says: The rate of price inflation may soon outstrip wage growth, putting a squeeze on wages. Indeed, the single month figure exceeds 2.5% only in construction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that real wage growth in the UK economy has now fallen to a two-year low, putting more pressure on households. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because average earnings only rose by 2.6% in October-December, while inflation averaged 1.2% over the quarter (and has climbed to 1.8% in January!). That means real wages, accounting for inflation, only rose by 1.4% in the last year. The TUC is urging the government to take more action - including ending the pay squeeze on public sector workers. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With prices rising faster, real pay growth is now slowing down. This will be worrying for families whose have still not seen their living standards recover following the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another fall in living standards. The Chancellor should tackle insecurity at work, invest in infrastructure and skills, and end the current pay restrictions on nurses, teachers and other key workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart plots the UK unemployment rate over the last 45 years (in blue), and also the rates for men (yellow) and women (red) It shows that the overall unemployment rate has dropped from 8.4% in 2011 to just 4.8% at the end of last year, the lowest since mid-2005 (not 2006 as I initially wrote earlier, sorry). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With employment at its highest rate since records began, and unemployment at its lowest in over a decade, we remain in a position of strength. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our ongoing welfare reforms will continue to incentivise work and make sure the system is fair to all those who need it and those who pay for it. With youth unemployment down, women in work at record levels and number of disabled people in work increasing too, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re delivering on our pledge to build a country that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Department of Work and Pensions are tweeting some positive points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report also shows how the number of non-UK nationals working in Britain has grown over the last two decades, from almost 4% of the workforce to nearly 11%. The ONS says that between October to December 2015 and October to December 2016: UK nationals working in the UK increased by 70,000 to 28.44 million non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 233,000 to 3.48 million And since October to December 1997.... the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased from just over 1 million to 3.48 million the proportion of all people working in the UK accounted for by non-UK nationals increased from 3.8% to 10.9% this increase in non-UK nationals working in the UK reflects the admission of several new member states to the European Union (EU) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report also shows a small drop in the number of EU workers in the UK, in the final three months of 2016. Does that show that the Brexit vote is having an effect? Possibly....but we should be cautious here, as these figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seasonally adjusted. The ONS says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data on non-UK nationals and non-UK born workers is not seasonally adjusted, so the small drop in the number of workers born in other EU countries, and small rise in the number of non-EU-born workers should be treated with caution. These figures may be affected by seasonal patterns in employment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first migration figures that include a post-referendum period will be published on 23 February, when ONS will release migration statistics for the year ended September 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the employment total at a record high, and the unemployment rate at an 11-year low, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force appears to be approaching full capacity. So argues ONS senior statistician David Freeman, anyway, who says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued moderate growth in employment has led to a new high in the total employment rate, while the rate for women has reached 70% for the first time on record. Overall, the labour market appears to be edging towards full capacity. This chart shows how wages growth slowed in the last month: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snapshot of the UK jobs report over the last year: BREAKING: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% as firms keep hiring workers, but wage growth has slowed. The labour report, just released, shows that: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months to December, remaining at its lowest level since 2005. The number of people in work jumped by 37,000 in the three months to December, meaning there are now 31.84 million people in work - 302,000 more than for a year earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new record high. The number of people out of work fell by 7,000 in the three months to December, taking the total down to 1.6 million. But.... wages growth was weaker than expected. Average earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% in the last quarter, down from 2.7% a month ago. And including bonuses, earnings also rose by 2.6% - down from 2.8%. Details and reaction to follow.... The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has issued a chilling warning today that a third of people in Britain are living on inadequate incomes that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide an adequate standard of living. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timely reminder that the unemployment rate, although important, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a full view of the state of the UK economy. An extra four million people have fallen into this bracket since 2008, according to JRF, because the cost of living has outpaced earnings since the financial crisis stuck. JRF says: The number of individuals below the Minimum Income Standard (MIS) rose by four million, from 15 million to 19 million (from 25 to 30 per cent of the population). There are 11 million people living far short of MIS, up from 9.1 million, who have incomes below 75% of the standard and are at high risk of being in poverty. The remaining eight million fall short of the minimum, by a smaller amount, and despite having a more modest risk of poverty, are just about managing at best. More than half of the households affected actually have at least one person in work -- but not being paid enough to provide a decent standard of living: JRF fears that many more people will be dragged into this situation, if wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise to keep pace with inflation: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Over in Greece, commissioner Pierre Moscovici has claimed Athens and her creditors are making progress towards finally concluding its latest bailout review. Moscovici struck an upbeat tone this morning, before a meeting with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. He told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is convergence at certain points so that we can conclude the review and move ahead. Some more small steps remain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmall steps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involve the measures which Greece must take before its creditors are satisfied that it is meeting the terms of its bailout, and hand over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in fresh loans. Moscovici has also tweeted that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picked up an award from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president this morning: European stocks are rallying (again) in early trading. Investors are cheered by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony by US central bank chief Janet Yellen, and her largely upbeat view of the American economy. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has hit a fresh record high, up 0.2% to 18,825, and there are solid gains in Frankfurt and Paris: Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that interest rates will rise soon is pushing bank shares higher, and her lack of anxiety over the US jobs market is also boosting confidence. Traders also seem to be clinging to hopes that Donald Trump will provide an economic boost by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending, rather than fretting about the unfolding scandal about links to Russia and the sudden departure of national security adviser Michael Flynn.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average earnings figures are particularly important, argues Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: With inflation on the rise the most talked about figure this Wednesday will likely be the wage growth reading, which is set to remain unchanged at 2.8% [including bonuses] That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all well and good for now, but given that UK inflation could hit 3% at some point in the second half of 2017 growth needs to pick up to avoid severely pinched pockets across the country. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market is in the spotlight today, with the publication of new unemployment figures at 9.30am GMT. The figures will be scrutinised for signs that the labour force is starting to suffer from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also show whether people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay is keeping up with inflation, which rose to 1.8% from 1.6% last month. Economists expect a fairly solid set of figures, with the headline unemployment rate likely to remain unchanged at 4.8%, an 11-year low. But the claimant count is tipped to rise by around 800 people in January, after dropping by 23,000 the previous month. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, are expected to remain unchanged at 2.7% -- or 2.8% if you include bonuses. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why this matters: With inflationary pressures starting to catch alight it is especially important that wages data keeps up, having been running ahead of inflation since mid-2014. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale suspects that the unemployment total may inch higher too.... A 5k increase in unemployment, and steady ex-bonus wage growth at 2.7% unlikely to move sterling, but soggy enough to keep a mildly bearish bias. Also on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda... Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be heading back to Congress for a second day of testimony to US lawmakers, from 3pm GMT. Yesterday she indicated that rate rises are coming, as it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunwise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to wait too long. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is in Athens today, hoping to narrow the gap between Greece and her creditors over the long-stalled bailout review. On the economic front, we get new US inflation figures at 1.30pm GMT. Economists predict that the CPI rose by 2.4% year-on-year in January, up from 2.1% in December - part of a wider trend of rising inflation. Plus, beer group Heineken, dairy chain Danone and French bank Credit Agricole are all reporting results today.",

Bloomberg reported that Deutsche was now trying to restructure Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $300m debt, which is guaranteed by four of his properties. The difficulty is obvious: conflict of interest. The president owes the bank money. At the same time the Trump administration and its Department of Justice is investigating Deutsche over its Russian money laundering scheme. Trump remains the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most high-profile client. He is also, increasingly, its biggest PR headache. Additional reporting by David Pegg",

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, after a lively session that saw MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-country index hit record highs this morning. But with Europe ending lower, and a mixed close on Wall Street, the rally may be taking a breather. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in the morning to see if world markets can hit fresh highs again. Goodnight! DING DING! The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, and the Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new closing high for the 6th day running. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move - the Dow ended the day up 7 points, or a meagre 0.04% at 20,619 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq both finished marginally lower, after five days of gains. Energy stocks ended the day in the red, with Chevon down 1.9% and Exxon down 1.1%. Caterpillar was another faller, down 0.85%. But Cisco Systems gained 2.4% and Coca Cola bubbled up by around 1.9%. With less than an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, the Dow is down a modest 13 points or 0.06%. Energy firms, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, and financial stocks such as Goldman Sachs have lost ground. But tech firms, including Cisco and Intel, are up. After a run of strong gains, the US dollar has dropped back today - suffering its biggest drop in two weeks. Currency traders are having second thoughts about the chances of an interest rate hike in March. The dollar bounced on Tuesday after Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated it would be a mistake to leave rates unchanged for too long - but that move is fading, with investors keen to hear more details of president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of shots from the New York stock exchange, as traders watched the Dow Jones, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit new alltime highs. Traders are keeping a close eye on the famous Wall Street \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index after it a two-week high today. The CBOE volatility index, or VIX, is now at its highest level since the end of January, following an 11% surge yesterday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors are somewhat jittery about the solidity of the market rally. The VIX is calculated from the cost of buying options on the S&amp;P 500 in a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, so shows if traders are trying to protect themselves from a crash. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still quite low in historical terms, at around 12.05 right now. Shares have been driven high in recent weeks by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax reform plan. However, we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any details...and that is starting to worry some investors. Tracy Maeter, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Philadelphia, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of these policies are game changers to certain sectors, and the market is being somewhat rational in terms of taking a bit of a breather before we have more facts as opposed to plans or intention. Trump is giving a press conference now, to announce his nomination for Labor secretary. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alexander Acosta, dean of Florida International University College of Law. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking the opportunity to lambast the media, but not to outline any stimulus measures. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, fears that the market boom will turn sour, eventually. He writes: For the time being, Wall Street is being supported by negative real interest rates and the prospect of tax cuts to come. That means stock market records will continue to be broken over the months ahead. Until the moment comes when traders get spooked by rising interest rates, burgeoning budget deficits, protectionism or a combination of all three. Wall Street is getting intoxicated on irrational exuberance. But remember: the wilder the party, the bigger the hangover. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart of the CAPE index, which measures share prices compared to company earnings - and is back at levels seen before serious crashes.... Hello again. European stock markets have ended the day slightly in the red, after helping to push global equities to record highs this morning. In London the FTSE 100 finished down 24 points, thanks to some big names going ex-dividend, and drops in mining companies. The pound strengthened a little during the day, breaking above $1.25 before dipping back. The US markets are bobbing around the break-even level, having hit new alltime highs at the start of trading after the strong manufacturing report from Philadelphia. Emerging markets did better, with China and India both up 0.5%, Russia gaining 0.3%. Speaking of Russia.... Joshua Mahony of IG reckons the unfolding firestorm over the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contacts with Moscow have hurt share prices. He says: Growing concerns about contact between President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team and Russia ahead of last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has tempered the rally in global stock markets today, with the FTSE dropping back a little. A drop in the US dollar is a sign that markets are growing increasingly worried over whether any notable link can be found between Russian intelligence agencies and the Trump campaign team. ABN Amro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief investment officer Didier Duret, says markets are being driven higher by recent solid economic data: With the exception of politics, I have rarely seen such a network of positive signals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a momentum, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when it will stop, but at the moment it is strong. Investors are rather underinvested anyway and there is lots of cash so equities are the asset class of default in this environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment for a break, but I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll be back later with the market close.... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has hit fresh highs at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have all moved higher, as the rally that has driven global markets to new heights continues. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong housing data, jobs figures and manufacturing surveys are all helping to underpin optimism on Wall Street. However... the VIX \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which measures nervousness in the markets, is pushing towards its highest level in a month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still low in historic terms, though, as this chart shows: A reader has got in touch about this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reference to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanimal spirits driving the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a phrase popularised by John Maynard Keynes, who wrote about how optimism, rather than deep-rooted analysis, drives many of our decisions. As he put it: Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as the result of animal spirits\u00e2\u20ac\u201da spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities. And bang on cue, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone else using the term today too... Although the surge in the Philadelphia Fed factory index to a 33-year high is impressive, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to make the US economy great again on its own. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, explains why: We do expect to see an acceleration in manufacturing output and employment growth this year but, just as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the downturn in 2015 and 2016 would plunge the wider economy into recession, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this revival to spill over into much faster GDP growth. Manufacturing is simply too small a part of the overall economy now. Boom! Factories in the Philadelphia area are growing at their fastest rate in three decades. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which provides fresh evidence that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is strengthening. The Philadelphia Fed business conditions index has surged to 43.3 in January, the strongest reading since the mid-1980s. Firms in the mid-Atlantic region reported a pick-up in new orders and shipments, indicating solid demand for their goods. The latest US unemployment data also looks pretty decent. Some 239,000 people filed new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial claims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to receive jobless benefit last week, up from 234,000, but less than expected. Any reading below 240,000 is rather impressive, points out financial research group Bespoke Investment. Just in: The number of permits being granted to build a house in America has hit a 14-month high. Permits for new construction jumped by 4.6% in January, to an annual rate of 1.29 million units - the highest number since November 2015. That may indicate optimism in the US construction sector. However....the number of actual new housing starts dipped in January, by 2.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still better than economist had expected, though. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat tweet about the stock market hitting its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclongest winning streak in decades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 may be a bit of Fake News. Strictly speaking, the three main US stock market benchmarks have all hit record highs for five days in a row -- the first time this has happened in 25 years. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually the longest winning streak on record, at all. Currently, the S&amp;P 500 is only on its best run in under four years. Marketwatch has the details: In terms of winning streaks, the S&amp;P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Dow Jones data. The Dow has gained for five straight days, its best stretch since December, and the Nasdaq has been up for seven sessions in a row, its best streak since its seven-session advance that ended Jan. 11. The European Central Bank has just broken the news drought by releasing the minutes of January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. They show that policymakers were keen to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpatient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and not tighten monetary policy too fast. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: The Governing Council was seen as well advised to remain patient and maintain a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsteady hand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to provide stability and predictability in an environment still characterised by a high level of uncertainty. The recent increases in energy prices had thus far not translated into indirect or second-round effects on broader inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But are they right? After all, inflation has just surged to 1.8%, from 1.1% in December.... Away from the markets...the president of General Motors has arrived in Westminster for talks with the UK government. On the agenda: GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to sell its Vauxhall division, which employs 4,500 people in Britain, to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSA Group. ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joel Hills snapped Dan Ammann arriving for talks with UK business secretary Greg Clark. The unions are very concerned that jobs could be threatened by the sale, and are pushing Clark to offer guarantees to protect staff. After all, it has already made some mysterious pledges to Nissan to encourage it to keep making cars in Sunderland. Look who wants to take the credit for the market rally..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how business activity and raw materials prices have both risen in recent months, hinting at stronger growth.... ...and another one showing how consumer prices are rising faster than expected too. Currency traders are taking a break from worrying about Brexit, says Jane Foley of Rabobank. But once Britain actually triggers Article 50, to begin the exit process from the EU, the pound may come under more pressure again. Foley says (via Reuters): Once the talks start properly the full complexity of the situation will become a lot more obvious.... Sterling will be up for a rocky ride at the very best.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Much of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness this morning is due to some major companies going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (meaning shareholders no longer quality for the next payout). Chris Beauchamp of IG explains: The FTSE 100 is trading modestly lower this morning, but most of these losses can be explained away by a number of big names going ex-dividend. BP, Shell, AstraZeneca and Imperial Brands are all trading without the benefit of the dividend, and with these heavyweights in the red it is going to be tough for the market to push higher. Given the steady rally we have seen over the past week or more, however, some weakness is to be welcomed, taking a little heat out of the market. For now, the bulls remain unconcerned. Having hit a one-month high yesterday, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is slightly spoiling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative by dipping in early trading. Mining companies and oil producers are falling, pulling the FTSE 100 down by 30 points to 7272. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the pound gaining against the US dollar; up half a cent to $1.25, cutting the value of revenues earned overseas in dollars. Other European markets are a little lower, after posting seven days of gains in a row - helping to drive global markets to record highs. Global stocks are now worryingly high, according to one well-respected measure that compares the price of shares with company earnings. The Cyclically Adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), formulated by economist Robert Shiller, is now almost 29; close to its level before the Black Tuesday crash of 1929. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean a crash is coming today - as FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed explains: Very few experts may disagree that valuations are overstretched, and that investors are willing to pay more premium on prospects of aggressive fiscal plans. We can even go further to discuss that bubbles are being formed, and Professor Robert Shiller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAPE PE ratio supports this opinion as it approaches 29. However, bubbles may grow bigger, even much bigger before they burst, if animal spirits continue to drive the rally. CAPE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time record is actually 45 - a level hit in 2000 as the dot-com boom surged. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end well..... Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, reckons that the rally has further to run -- despite concerns that valuations have risen too high. US equity indices posted fresh record highs on Wednesday, and the FTSE 100 is less than 50 points away from its record 7,354 level reached in mid-January. The lead indicators for the markets, including the Dow Jones Transportation Index and the Russell 2000 also scaled to fresh heights, suggesting that this rally is here to stay, even as some economists and analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rush to argue that markets are stretched, volumes are low and valuations are too high. But.... Donald Trump could potentially sent the markets spinning, she adds. The Russian Ruble was one of the worst performers yesterday, this came after President Trump tweeted that President Obama was too soft on Russia over its invasion of Crimea. What about the Trump/ Putin bromance that has been blossoming and driving the ruble higher? We doubt that it is over, and would imagine that relationship has a long way to run. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a keen reminder that President Trump, rather than valuation measures, are a bigger threat to the stock market rally. There should be some red faces in the City over this stock market rally. Many experts predicted that stocks would plunge if Donald Trump won the US election - instead, trillions has been wiped onto share values since November. Optimism over American economy is helping to drive markets to record levels, says the Financial Times. The FT argues that hopes for faster economic growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153galvanised markets from the US to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street has led the rally since Donald Trump captured the White House, hardening expectations that the US expansion will quicken just as the Japanese, Chinese and eurozone economies show signs of improvement. And that has driven the FTSE All-World index (another measure of global markets) over its previous peak in 2015: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit their highest ever levels, as the bullish optimism rippling through global trading floor around the globe refuses to abate. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Index, which tracks shares in 46 markets, has climbed over its previous high (set in 2015) overnight, and hitting 444.29 points for the first time ever. The surge came as US stock markets hit fresh peaks last night. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driving it? 1) Optimism over the global economy. Recent economic data has shown little sign that global growth is cooling off, despite last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit shocks and upcoming elections in Europe. 2) Expectations of higher inflation. Prices are rising in America, Europe and the UK, with the US CPI hitting a four-year high yesterday. This is likely to lead to higher interest rates, with a US rate hike possible in March. So some traders will be selling bonds and shifting money into shares. 3) The Trump Trade. Investors are still betting that the US president will deliver on his pledges for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax reform package, and infrastructure spending - despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various missteps since taking office. Financial stocks have been surging since Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the White House in November. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has the details: Whatever political problems President Trump maybe having on the staffing front with resignations and the like financial markets remain largely ambivalent, choosing to focus on last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to deliver something \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a couple of weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, as US markets hit new record highs for the fifth day in a row, driven by banks and financials. Both Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan shares have hit record levels, with the financial sector up 22% since the 8th November, while here in the UK the FTSE250 has also managed to post record highs five days in succession, as UK stocks appear to be becoming a haven from political concerns in Europe. Optimism about the global outlook is improving as economic data continues to improve and inflations starts to take hold, and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive US finish is set to wash through into another positive open this morning. Also coming up today... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic calendar, apart from: 12.30pm GMT: The European Central Bank publishes an account of its last monetary policy meeting 1.30pm GMT: New US housing starts and building permits data 1.30pm GMT: The weekly US jobless claims figures",

                "bodyText":"Hang on.... Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have just warned that it might take a dimmer view of Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit worthiness, if this deal happens. Ernesto Bisagno, Senior Analyst at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst it is still early days, Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer for Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares would be credit negative for Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bondholders, as 2017 pro-forma combined leverage would likely rise significantly - excluding cost savings and synergies - from the moderate 2.0x Unilever currently shows on a standalone basis. Also, Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current rating is Baa3 and thus five notches lower than Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A1 rating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The London stock market has closed the week..and Unilever shares have ended the day up 13.5% higher at \u00c2\u00a337.97. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new alltime closing high, and not far from the \u00c2\u00a340 per share which Kraft Heinz has proposed paying, in an offer that has electrified the City of London. Over on Wall Street, shares in Kraft Heinz have also jumped - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up 7% right now. That actually pushes up the value of the cash-and-share deal. But with Unilever standing firm tonight, its US suitor faces paying an even bigger price to get one of of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest ever mergers off the ground. Chris Beauchamp of IG believes this story has much further to run.... For now the approach has been rebuffed, and in relatively robust language from the tone of Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. Until today Unilever shares had steadily underperformed the FTSE 100 over the past six months, left behind by more glamorous sectors such as mining, but today has seen that situation reverse. Backed by Warren Buffett, Kraft is likely to return for another tilt at the prize, with a bid of this size unlikely to have been made without careful consideration. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the potential deal: Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend. GW While Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have soared, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds have taken a slip. Investors are worrying that it might take on a lot more debt if the Kraft Heinz deal goes though, potentially weakening its credit-worthiness. Hat-tip to the Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Mackintosh: John Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, believes the unions are right to worry about job cuts. He says: The main benefits from such a deal would be major cost reduction as head offices and regional management could be merged. There would also be some purchasing benefits from increased buying power. Changing attitude to food has put pressure on Kraft Heinz to pursue a merger, argues Mark Jones, a solicitor and food and drink industry expert at Gordons law firm. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because younger people are keener on freshly cooked foods than previous generations, he argues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer choices are changing, we are moving away from processed foods and towards fresh. Millennials will soon surpass the baby boomer generation as the largest living generation and millennials are not keen on processed food. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The packaged food businesses have seen their sales growth slow in the last few years and because of this they are looking at ways to preserve margins. One way to do this is merge and take the benefit of economies of scale. The deal would make a lot of sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Others spreads, drinks and sauces are available, of course... The Unite union, which represents Unilever workers, is urging the company to reject Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpredatory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 takeover bid. It fears that a takeover would lead to job cuts, and a drop in quality, as the US firm tries to squeeze costs out. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unite is seeking an urgent meeting with Unilever senior management where we will seek assurances that the company will resist this predatory takeover by Kraft Heinz. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unite members make household products which are much loved by UK consumers. Kraft Heinz and their backers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reputation for cost cutting, we believe, will lead to great brands being harmed through job cuts and a never ending drive to push costs down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This takeover bid, is we fear, driven by a desire for a growth in sales, not through product innovation and maintaining great brands, but by gobbling up a major competitor and slashing costs to generate a quick buck. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unite does not believe this takeover is either in Kraft Heinz workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interests or those of Unilever and that ultimately it will lead to jobs losses and poorer products for consumers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Antitrust regulators might have issues with such massive companies merging, says ETX Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Wilson. Would competition authorities let this one through? It could come up against a number of hurdles as it would create a giant in the sector. EU regulators in particular could be against it. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has warned that jobs could be lost, and consumers could also suffer, if the deal goes through. He says: We anticipate that this has a lot to do with Brexit as well. Theresa May has not triggered the Brexit yet, the effects of this have started to surface. Perhaps, predators see a lot of blood and opportunity and falling sterling has produced enough blood on the street for firms around the world to look and cash on opportunities. They are coming out with big bazookas and trying to make deals which we have not seen. You can not blame them because tt is cheap for them and the time is right. So we do not think Kraft Heinz is going to back down anytime soon. If the deal does see the daylight, this simply mean more job loss for UK and more pain for consumers as competition will erode. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes Kraft Heinz will need to raise its offer substantially, to get enough Unilever shareholders onside. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is cheap money meeting industrial logic. Putting portfolios of brands together can create huge synergies across marketing, manufacturing and distribution, even before you think about cutting the combined HQ back to size. Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the Fast Forward button, for to acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades. With debt cheap and abundant right now, Kraft have spotted their opportunity. Unilever were clearly in no mood to sell, having spurned the first advance, but Kraft Heinz are not put off. But what will Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders have to say? The long term boost to portfolios that Unilever has delivered has been enormous. A short term premium today is no compensation for losing the growth that Unilever could produce for decades to come. So to win over a majority of Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders, we think Kraft Heinz will need to dig very deep indeed.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This chart shows how Unilever shares surged to fresh record highs, driving its value towards the $143bn on offer from Kraft Heinz. Dutch TV journalist Durk Veenstra suspects that Unilever would accept a higher offer: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dan Wilchins says the fall in sterling since last summer has made UK-listed companies vulnerable to offers. Corporate band and reputation adviser Spencer Fox suggests the two firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good fit: (Unilever CEO Paul Polman is a vocal advocate for corporate responsibility and running a sustainable business). So, we now know that Kraft Heinz has offered to pay around $50 per Unilever share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around \u00c2\u00a340, at the current exchange rate. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now trading around \u00c2\u00a337.65 per share, up from \u00c2\u00a333.60 this morning. Newsflash: Unilever has just issued a statement to the City, confirming that it rejected Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach. The Anglo-Dutch firm reveals that Kraft Heinz offered to pay $143bn (or nearly \u00c2\u00a3115bn), in a mixture of cash and its own shares. But Unilever insists this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, and says it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any point in talking further. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: Unilever notes the recent announcement by The Kraft Heinz Company (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) that it has made a potential offer for all of the shares of Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. Their proposal represents a premium of 18% to Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price as at the close of business on 16 February 2017. This fundamentally undervalues Unilever. Unilever rejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders. Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions. Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. recommend that shareholders take no action. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. The proposal received was that Unilever common shareholders would receive $50.00 per share in a mix of $30.23 per share in cash payable in U.S. dollars and 0.222 new enlarged entity shares per existing Unilever share, which valued Unilever at a total equity value of approximately $143 billion. As at the close of business on 16 February 2017, a mix of $30.23 in cash payable in U.S. dollars and 0.222 Kraft Heinz shares per existing Unilever share would value each Unilever common share at $49.61, representing a premium of 18% to Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. Warren Buffett, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest men, is right at the heart of this merger bid. Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway group engineered Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Kraft in 2015, working with Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private equity giant 3G Capital. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now the largest shareholder of the company. Kraft Heinz has been cutting costs and boosting cash flows since it was created, which looks to be preparation for another merger. Shares in Kraft Heinz have jumped by over 3% in pre-market trading in New York. Between them, Unilever and Kraft Heinz control many of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular consumer brands. Unilever produces washing powder (Persil and Surf), spreads (Flora and Bertolli), ice cream (Ben &amp; Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Magnum and Cornetto), personal care items (Dove, Sure, and Vaseline), and cleaning products (Domestos and Cif). Kraft Heinz also has its fingerprints all over your kitchen, from ketchup, soup and Philadelphia cheese to Kool-Aid and Capri Sun. If this deal goes through, it would be one of the largest takeover deals ever. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation has surged to over \u00c2\u00a3100bn since the FT broke the news that Heinz Kraft has made an approach. No foreign company has ever paid that much for a British firm. The biggest takeover ever took place in 2000, when mobile network giant Vodafone swept on German rival Mannesmann in a deal worth \u00c2\u00a3112bn, or $180bn, at the time. Shares in Unilever have surged by 11% after Kraft Heinz confirmed that it has approached the company about a merger. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve jumped from \u00c2\u00a333.60 to over \u00c2\u00a337 per share, as traders bet that a deal will be done - despite Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial rejection. Big breaking news..... Kraft Heinz, the food giant, has approached Anglo-Dutch consumer chain Unilever over a merger. Kraft has just issued a statement to the City, revealing that it approached Unilever with a proposal to merge the two companies. That approach has been turned down...but Kraft hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up. It says it hopes to reach an agreement with Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The Kraft Heinz Company (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kraft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) notes the recent speculation regarding a possible combination of Kraft and Unilever plc / Unilever NA (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Kraft confirms that it has made a comprehensive proposal to Unilever about combining the two groups to create a leading consumer goods company with a mission of long-term growth and sustainable living. While Unilever has declined the proposal, we look forward to working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction. There can be no certainty that any further formal proposal will be made to the Board of Unilever or that an offer will be made at all or as to the terms of any transaction. That speculation was sparked by the Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alphaville site, which reported this morning that an approach had been made. More to follow! City traders are betting that the retail sales slowdown has cut the chances of UK interest rates rising anytime soon. The pound fell as low as $1.2388, down almost a cent. Money is pouring into UK government bonds too, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on 10-year gilts to a three month low. That means the bonds are changing hands at the highest price since November -- another sign that rates are likely to stay low. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that the fall in UK consumer spending over the last few months could be a good thing, in the long run at least. After all, economists have long worried that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was too reliant on its nation of shoppers. Perhaps a rebalancing is now taking place... Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, argues that UK households are sensibly adjusting to the Brexit vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might not be what businesses want to hear but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started to reign in our spending a little after our big splurge at the end of the year. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep on spending like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tomorrow as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cause massive problems later on. Households are going to feel the pinch as prices start to rise and we all need to be a little more sensible with our money. Sorting out a decent budget and being measured with your spending is the best thing to do right now. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of financial firm Sun Global Investments, also sees some positives: Sluggish wage growth and rising inflation would mean we no longer may be able to depend on consumers keeping the economy buoyant. However this could also be a good thing in the long term. Former Chancellor George Osborne always emphasised that the economy had to rebalance away from borrowing, consumption and imports to saving, manufacturing and exports. This rebalancing requires greater saving and less consumption and therefore the consumers have to retrench. This will be negative for the economy in the short-term but could mean a more balanced UK economy in the longer run.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, also fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers spending is faltering, following the drop in retail sales over the last three months. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report represents the first fall in three month on three month sales since December 2013, and suggests the underlying trend is indeed taking a turn for the worse. The prospect of a sustained dip in consumer spending is a sobering one for sterling, which has been supported by strong macro data during the political uncertainty of the last few months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures provide clear evidence that consumer spending will be squeezed this year, says Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. A sharp turnaround in the inflation environment has put a sharp brake on the growth of retail spending - and we are likely to see more of the same as we move through 2017 and next year. Sentance also points out that consumers are no longer benefitting from cheap fuel -- prices for petrol have jumped in recent months, leaving less money for other goods. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 2015 and the first half of last year, falling prices on the high street and at the petrol pump boosted the volume of retail spending. Shop and motor fuel prices were falling by 2.5% to 3% a year over this period and this supported 4.5%-5% growth in the volume of retail sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By contrast, this January we have seen a rise in prices in the retail sector - which are now nearly 2% up on a year ago. Not surprisingly this change in the inflationary trend has squeezed the growth in the volume of retail spending to just 1.5% compared with last year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote is now hitting the retail sector, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. All the numbers today show a downward trend and the anticipated knock to consumer spending from rising inflation may already be evident. Households are clearly starting to feel the effects of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in value and this will only get worse as prices rise over the coming months as hedging contracts expire. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, is also worried by the fall in UK retail sales -- it could show that consumers are cutting back. The slowdown in retail spending over the last quarter shows that consumers are tightening their belts, argues Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever flags up that December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales were the third-worst in the last two decades: Samuel Tombs of Pantheon predicts that retail sales will keep falling this year, as retailers hike prices. This chart shows the big picture in UK retail - prices are going up, and the amount of stuff we can buy is going down. The pound has fallen sharply after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales missed forecasts, shedding over half a cent to $1.242 Breaking: UK retail sales have fallen for the third month running, fuelling concerns that consumers are cutting back as inflation rises. The volume of goods sold online and on the high street shrank by 0.3% in January. That follows a downwardly-revised 2.1% plunge in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big shock for the City - most economists expected retail sales to bounce back last month. The Office for National Statistics also found that retail sales fell by 0.4% over the last quarter, compared to the previous three months - the first fall since December 2013. ONS statistician Kate Davies says: In the three months to January 2017, retail sales saw the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013. The evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report also shows that inflationary pressures are buffeting shoppers -- average store prices (including fuel) increased by 1.9% on the year, driven by more expensive petrol. Details and reaction to follow! All the major European markets have dipped this morning, as the aftermath of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference ripples through trading floors. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ding-dong battle with the press corps yesterday was big on jaw-dropping quotes (uranium is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnuclear weapons and other things\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, for example), but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contain much to reassure investors. Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First explains: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference yesterday was a return to the policies and performance aesthetics of his candidacy. Accusations and grandstanding apart, the performance offered us little substance on any economic matters more than he has already told us. If candidate Trump returns to the podium continually while a Congress works to enact tax reform then the relationship between the two are all important. He needs Congress to build stuff but he does not need them to start tearing things down. Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, was also unimpressed, saying (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erratic performance in the press conference has had a destabilising influence on investor confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another bad day for Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, as the crisis at its nuclear division rumbles on. Shares in Toshiba slumped by another 10% today, after S&amp;P warned that it could sharply downgrade its credit rating if it restructures its debts. Such a move would be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153selective default\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the agency said. Earlier this week, Toshiba revealed a $6.3bn writedown on the spiralling cost of two nuclear power station projects in America, following mass cost overruns and delays. A quiet start to trading in London has seen the FTSE 100 dip by just 7 points, to 7270. Traders have noted that the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both fell last night, although the Dow did hit a record high for the sixth day running. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors are sensibly banking some profits, as Donald Trump may struggle to deliver on his tax reform pledges. US equities closed lower last night after their massive rally and the stocks over in Asia traded mostly in the lower territory as well. Investors are confident about the economic health of the biggest economy in the world, the US, and are optimistic that upcoming fiscal and tax plans are going to have a more positive impact on the economy. Having said that, many do believe that the market is getting ahead of itself and there is just too much optimism about how far Mr Trump can go with his fiscal and tax plans as he still needs full approval from congress. The chances of that are not that great and this is what makes some investors a little pessimistic. Mr Trump applauded himself in a tweet yesterday by mentioning that the run in the stock market was mainly due to investor confidence which comes on the back of his upcoming tax plan. Of course, the question is how long can you chew on this, and if your words are not backed up with action, you run a massive risk of disappointment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Has the rally fizzled out? After hitting record highs on Thursday, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are looking edgier today. Investors are digesting Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable press conference, in which he blasted the press and defended his administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early progress - but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flesh out his promises of tax reforms and fiscal spending. That has pushed some Asian indices into the red, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei closing down 0.6% and China and Hong Kong also losing ground. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left us looking at a very quiet start to trading in London. But that could change at 9.30am GMT, when the latest UK retail sales figures are released. Economists are expecting to see that retail spending recovered in January, up around 1% in the month (including petrol), after falling unexpectedly by 1.9% in December. A weaker reading might indicate that consumers are now feeling the pinch from higher inflation, which has forced real wage growth down to a two-year low. RBC Capital Markets believe rising prices will cause a slowdown in the aisles. If consumers are having to pay increased prices, volume growth will be harder to come by than when there was deflation in the sector. Volume growth has already slipped from over 7% y/y in October to 4.3% y/y in December, with the consensus estimate for January data today looking for a dip below 4% y/y. Also coming up today... The Greek government and its creditors will continue talks over its bailout today. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real hope of a breakthrough in time for next Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. This uncertainty could weaken the euro, warns analyst Tony Cross of TopTradr: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been here many times before and a compromise will more than likely be found, but tensions are going to be heightened in Germany with the elections looming and continued distributions to other parts of the Eurozone continuing to annoy the electorate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if they have by all accounts done very well out of the imbalance in recent years. EU officials are now suggesting that a deal could come in March... ....the omens from the football field aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encouraging for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, though. Otherwise, it could be a quiet end to a lively week....",

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Time for a quick wrap-up. Officials representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are heading back to Athens after the two sides agreed to discuss new economic reforms. The two sides will draw up fresh tax measures, pension changes and labour market reforms. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says the aim is to move away from austerity and towards structural reforms, and growth-friendly measures to help Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. He told reporters in Brussels that: There will be a change in the policy mix,moving perhaps away from austerity and putting more emphasis on reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The plan could break the deadlock which has prevented Greece receiving its next tranche of aid. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no guarantee that agreement will be reached, or that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament will approve it. Dijsselbloem cautioned that it could take some time to agree fresh measures. And while Athens doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face any major debt repayments until the summer, the eurogroup hopes for a deal quickly for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stability reasons and confidence reasons.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek bonds are rallying tonight, on hopes that the country will avoid another episode in its long-running debt crisis. In other news... Unilever has suffered its worst day on the stock market since 2008, after Kraft Heinz abandoned its takeover ambitions. Shares ended the day down 6.5%. Shareholders said that Kraft hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered enough to sway them, while the UK government denied putting its oar in. French government bonds have come under renewed pressure after new polls showed far-right Marine Le Pen gaining support. The gap between France and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs is at its widest level since 2012. British factories have reported a jump in new orders...and warned that they plan to hike prices. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The IMF has issued a cautious statement, welcoming Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to satisfying its creditors...but warning that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no guarantee of an agreement on new measures. Dublin MEP Nessa Childers isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced: Q: Given that Greece and the institutions must agree new measures, and the government must legislate them, when can we realistically expect Greece to get its next bailout payment? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a lot of work to do, and a lot of issues to discuss and calibrate, so I want to temper expectations, Dijsselbloem says. There is no need for a disbursement in March, April or May, he insists. I hope we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need all that time - we will have a discussion in the eurogroup once a staff level agreement is agreed. If we do it in March, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it in March.... If not, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it later. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it well in time. Q: Do you think Greece and the institutions will agree a package that persuades the International Monetary Fund to join the bailout, and will you provide the next tranche of bailout funds if not? Dijsselbloem says the IMF wants to see Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy recovering, and see that its debts are sustainable. So we must get these reforms agreed. The aim is to show that they will help support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery and make its debt sustainable [then the IMF is more likely to come on board]. Dijsselbloem says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put a figure on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement, as some measures are still being discussed. But what has been agreed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the liking of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he adds. Q: Does today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement mean the end of austerity in Greece?.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem slaps this idea down straight away! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a finance minister, he says, I can never promise the end of austerity, as finance ministers must maintain a tight budget and ensure it is sustainable. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget is in a much better state than a few years ago, so we are now looking at structural reforms to support the recovery. So there is clearly now a shift from austerity to structural reforms, he reiterates.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some relief in the bond market: Q: Must the Greek government legislate any fresh measures before the mission teams will return? No, Dijsselbloem replies, the institutions will now return to Athens. They will talk to the Greek authorities about the specifics of tax reforms, pension reforms, the labour markets, etc. Once the two sides have reached an agreement, those measures will have to be legislated before Greece gets its next tranche of bailout funds, though. Q: The Greek government has just told us that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take one euro of extra austerity, so how can they stick to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement? Dijsselbloem says that both sides are looking to change the focus of the Greek bailout programme, away from austerity and towards structural reforms. Those reforms could create \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfiscal space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which Greece could then use to fund growth-enhancing measures. Onto questions... Q: Who gave ground today to allow the teams from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to return to Athens? Dijsselbloem explains that both sides have agreed to resume talks on various reforms, including the labour market -- and issues like collective wage bargaining. If a staff level agreement can be reached, then there can be political agreement...and then creditors can also look at the issue of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium term debt relief\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Greece. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici tells the press conference in Brussels that both sides are committed to reaching an agreement on new fiscal measures. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement is an important step, he insists. Some instant reaction to the Greek breakthrough, starting with Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Derek Gatopoulos: Teneo Intelligence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolf Piccoli isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Official! Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are heading back to the capital, to discuss a new package of measures to ensure it is keeping up with its bailout requirements. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that enough progress has been made for officials to return to Athens \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the very short term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They will work with the Greek authorities on a new package of reforms, including tax reforms and labour market regulation. The policy mix will change - away from austerity, and with a stronger emphasis on deeper reforms, Dijsselbloem adds. Once the package has been agreed, the Eurogroup will then consider whether it is sufficient to unlock Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next bailout payment. Dijsselbloem adds that there is no liquidity issue with Greece, but there is a sense of urgency to get a breakthrough before confidence is affected. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off.... Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem starts by apologising for the early finish of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and jokes that many reporters will consequently miss this press conference. He says that the eurozone economy continues to improve, with growth picking up and unemployment falling. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is claiming victory, arguing that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean additional austerity..... The latest from Brussels.... Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith has the details of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal -- Athens is agreeing to legislate for further fiscal reforms that might kick in, if required, in 2019. Greek bond yields are rising in value, following these reports that a deal has been hammered out to allow creditors to return to Athens for fresh talks. In a rare and unexpected development, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting has ended ahead of schedule! Hopefully we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been agreed soon..... German MEP Markus Ferber has fired a warning shot at Athens, by issuing a statement urging the Greek government to step up the implementation of its bailout programme. Ferber says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect a clear signal by the Eurogroup today. It is not the time for new compromises, new concessions or even debt relief. We have seen a lot of this in the past and preciously little has changed. Now it is time for the Greek government to deliver. There is a very long to-do list for the Greek government to start working on. Otherwise, the money supply must be shut off. Upping the pressure is first of all a question of credibility, but would also send the signal to the International Monetary Fund that the Eurogroup means business and wants the IMF to stay on board.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While we wait for a press conference in Brussels, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some photos from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting: Further confirmation of a mini-breakthrough in Brussels: Greek journalist Ioannis Antypas has also heard that Greece and its lenders have made enough progress to allow talks to resume in Athens: Well-placed sources in Athens in contact with officials in Brussels are reporting that there has been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convergence of views\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - enough to allow auditors to return to the Greek capital and continue the bailout review. But senior members in the ruling leftwing Syriza party are insisting that whatever compromise is found will have to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honourable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so that it is endorsed by the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central committee and parliamentary group. Senior cadres and MEPs are not ruling out political turbulence with some MPS standing down in protest over the additional measures creditors say Greece will have to implement for the review to be wrapped up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The previous government should have been left to do the dirty work which Syriza was later asked to do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Syriza MEP Stelios Koulouglou told the Guardian, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever will be agreed will be a bad deal which [prime minister Alexis] Tsipras will have to sell to Syriza and to the Greek public.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can (usually) rely on European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici to take an optimistic view of events.... Here we go! Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has arrived at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Dijsselbloem tells the assembled press pack that ministers will discuss whether to sent their officials back to Athens to resume negotiations over the bailout programme. He says that he wants to conclude the review soon, but the issues are complex. Dijsselbloem also argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no urgency to hand Greece more money (its next debt repayments are in July). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another hint that we probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a breakthrough today. AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danny Kemp has more details: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolfgang Schauble has told reporters outside today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a breakthrough over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout today. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still confident that the two sides will agree what further reforms Athens must take, in time. Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Peter Ka\u00c5\u00beim\u00c3\u00adr, has warned against allowing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout problems to overshadow this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not willing to wave through debt relief for Athens, just to get the issue out of the headlines. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details, hot off Twitter. Eurozone finance ministers are arriving in Brussels for this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Bloomberg reports that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has been talking about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story in the Guardian, about how European politicians are unhappy with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to negotiations: Bon Dieu! French government bonds are suffering a nasty selloff as Marine Le Pen wins more support ahead of this spring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential elections. New opinion polls show the Front National candidate would win 42% of the vote if she faced centrist Emmanuel Macron in a two-way run-off for the presidency, and 44% against right-winger Francois Fillon. This indicates that the gap is narrowing, raising the chances that the nationalist, anti-euro Le Pen wins power. So the gap between French and German borrowing costs is now at its widest since summer 2012, as eurozone break-up fears ripple through the markets again. Over in Downing Street, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman has insisted that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t influence Kraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw its offer for Unilever. Asked about the deal at the regular lobby briefing, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the issue of the withdrawal from the Unilever deal by Kraft is an issue you should put to Kraft. Number 10 wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involved in it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The simple fact is that the bid has been withdrawn so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a view on a bid that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It emerged over the weekend that May had instructed officials to look into the deal, and the PM will probably be relieved that the deal has gone away. With Brexit negotiations starting soon, the government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t also want a row over the future of one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major employers, whose products are used by millions of people each day. Germany is also downplaying expectations ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting on Greece: Over in Greece, officials are warning that it will require a miracle for a breakthrough to be reached at the Eurogoup of euro area finance ministers this afternoon. With the exception of Eurogroup head, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is pushing for a solution before Dutch elections next month, there is almost no one who believes much more than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153framework of an agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be reached today. One insider tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are really looking towards the German chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with [IMF chief Christine] Lagarde on Wednesday,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker also attending the talks in Berlin, the hope was that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be clinched to break the impasse, he said, adding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bar a miracle there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a solution today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Athens is interpreting emollient remarks by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, last night, as a good sign. In an interview with ARD television, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble rejected accusations that his preference was for Greece to leave the euro. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never made any [\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122] threats...I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident that Greece is on the right path.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Negotiations will continue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until the moment the Eurogroup starts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek officials say. But in the meantime, nervous investors are selling Greek two-year debt - sending the interest rate on the bonds up to an eight-month high... Just in: UK factories are enjoying a surge in demand, driving order books to their highest level in two years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck, which suggests that British manufacturing continues to shrug off the shock of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Some 27% of businesses reported total orders to be above normal and 19% said orders were below normal, giving a balance of +8%, the highest since February 2015. But...the survey also found that the weak pound is driving up import costs. Around 38% of companies now expect to raise prices and 6% expecting to cut prices, giving a balance of +32% - the highest since April 2011. The pound has begun the week on the front foot, gaining half a cent against the US dollar to 1.246. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still almost 10% weaker than 12 months ago, when David Cameron announced the date of the EU referendum. The cost of insuring Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt against default has also dropped sharply today. That shows that bondholders are relieved that the threat of a Kraft Heinz takeover has faded away. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds had suffered a big selloff on Friday, on fears that the company might be downgraded if the deal went through. The company has a much better credit rating than its US rival (A1, five notches higher than Kraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Baa3). Heads-up: Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem will speak to the press around 1.45pm GMT. Expect a few questions about the Greek bailout (see opening post for details). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has also noted that Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still higher than before Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid became public. That suggests City investors are expecting further action, even though Kraft Heinz has now sloped off. While this bid appears to have fallen at the first fence it undoubtedly keeps the focus on a sector that could see further consolidation. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Dobson also sounds sceptical that this story is really over. The slump in the pound since the Brexit vote has made British firms an attractive asset. But Mike Grayer, partner and head of corporate finance at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, reckons that big UK firms can repel overseas suiters if they want. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been some speculation about whether the takeover offer by Kraft Heinz was motivated by the weak value of the pound but in my opinion this is unlikely to be the case. The continued buoyancy of UK equity markets is negating the effect of the dollar / pound exchange rate and is likely to keep opportunistic multinationals at bay. It is more likely that this proposed deal was motivated by a straightforward desire to consolidate and drive economies of scale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While UK plc is well placed to fight off unwanted takeover attention from overseas, SMEs may wish to take advantage of the exit opportunities that current market conditions are generating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unsurprisingly, Unilever is dragging the London stock market back this morning. The FTSE 100 has dipped into the red, down 2 points, despite Royal Bank of Scotland surging by 6% to its highest level since the EU referendum. RBS shareholders are cheering a government plan to spare it selling off 300 branches. Unilever isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company having a bad morning in the City. Bovis Homes, the housebuilder, has also slumped by over 7% this morning after it set aside \u00c2\u00a37m to fix problems with newly built homes. The move follows a storm of complaints from angry customers whose houses weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to scratch, due to ropey tiling, shoddy plumbing or dodgy kitchen fitting. Acting CEO Earl Sibley says fixing customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 homes is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute operational priority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been touring Bovis properties to apologise to customers. More here: Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Paul Polman, is known for earnest lectures about the importance of ethics and responsible capitalism, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proved that he can also roll his sleeves when required. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Kate Holton explains: Backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, Kraft had wanted to buy Unilever to build a global consumer goods giant but its offer was flatly rejected on Friday by the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. According to people familiar with the matter, Kraft had not expected to encounter the resistance it received from Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman, who dismissed the offer as having no financial or strategic merit. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation has now dropped back to \u00c2\u00a3106bn, having hit a record high of \u00c2\u00a3114bn on Friday. One for City chartists out there.... Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now on track for their worst day in over 13 years, Reuters says. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slumped to around \u00c2\u00a335 per share, down from \u00c2\u00a338 on Friday evening. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for investors who piled into the stock after Kraft revealed its approach, worth \u00c2\u00a340 per share, around noon on Friday. But even so....they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still rather higher than last Thursday - when you could get a Unilever share for \u00c2\u00a333.50. Bloomberg reporter Thomas Buckley suspects Warren Buffett didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy a bruising hostile takeover battle for Unilever: The political backlash against Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach for Unilever also helped to doom the bid. Former business secretary Vince Cable let the charge. He urged prime minister Theresa May to block the approach, and deliver on her pledge to fight predatory takeovers. Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes this was a significant factor: We expect the chief reason to drop the bid was concern about the political atmosphere in Britain, which is currently against foreigners making bids for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national treasures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, even half-Dutch ones like Unilever. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons the bid collapsed because that Warren Buffet (Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest shareholder) wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put his hand deeper into his pocket. Salmon says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the news broke that Kraft were in the frame for a takeover on Friday, Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial reaction was frosty to say the least. However, Kraft was clearly hopeful of working towards a deal. With the shares settling around half way between a realistic second offer price and where they traded before the news broke, the deal going through was far from a formality. However, it is still surprising to see it shelved just one business day after the initial news broke. The deal was set to top \u00c2\u00a3100bn, so the size premium would always have been a consideration- especially since Warren Buffett, one of the biggest names behind the bid, hardly has a reputation for paying anything other than the price he sees fit. What exactly happened in this whirlwind of a story is yet to be fully revealed, but it looks like Unilever isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just playing hard to get. It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Why did Kraft Heinz walk away so fast? One reason is that it simply wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offering enough for Unilever. Louise Kernohan of Aberdeen Asset Management (a Unilever shareholder) told Bloomberg TV that Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach was a big surprise, but she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it would work. Kraft Heinz was only offering to pay around 18% above Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to tempt long-term shareholders who are looking for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double-digit returns in perpetuity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Kernohan explained. A weekend is a long time in dealmaking. Shares in Unilever have plunged by over 7% at the start of trading, after Kraft Heinz announced that it was abandoning its attempts to merge with its Anglo Dutch rival. That wipes out some, but not all, of the 13.5% surge on Friday after Kraft Heinz revealed it had approached Unilever with an offer worth \u00c2\u00a3115bn. Some investors had expected a classic takeover battle, potentially leading to the creation of a packaged foods and household items titan. But instead Kraft Heinz has thrown in the towel with surprising speed, following a rather negative reaction to its approach (Unilever insisted that the offer, at \u00c2\u00a340 per share, was far too low). The two sides now say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold each other in high regard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in a joint statement confirming the approach is toast. It appears that Kraft Heinz has received an unexpectedly cool response from Unilever shareholders, who agreed that the proposal lacked merit. The US company may also have been spooked by the political reaction, with some politicians remembering its takeover of chocolate firm Cadbury in 2010. The collapse of talks will reassure workers, as unions had feared hefty job cuts if the two companies had joined forces. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout woes are back on the agenda today, as Eurozone finance ministers are head to Brussels for a crunch meeting. The Eurogroup will hope to make progress towards breaking the deadlock between Athens and her creditors, who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree what measures Greece must take to hit its bailout targets. A few weeks ago, there had been hopes of a big breakthrough at this meeting, that would unlock \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of aid loans. But this now seems highly unlikely, meaning Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems will now overshadow elections in the Netherlands and France this spring. If Greece doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get this \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn by July, it may be unable to repay loans to the European Central Bank - triggering another debt crisis, and possibly even a fourth rescue package. As Nick Kounis of ABN Amro Bank puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Delays in completing the review raise the risk of another bailout being needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The situation looks pretty murky right now. For months, the two sides have been split over tax rises, labour market reforms and pensions. And overshadowing everything is the International Monetary Fund, which insists that Greece needs substantial debt relief. Greece wants the IMF to stop demanding pension reforms. Germany insists that the IMF takes part in the Greek bailout - but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that Athens needs debt relief. And round and round we go..... The Eurogroup meeting starts around 1pm GMT, with a press conference scheduled for 5.30pm GMT. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching Unilever closely, after Kraft Heinz dramatically abandoned its attempts to merge with its rival last night. In the City, housebuilding chain Bovis Homes are reporting results. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look great at first glance, with profits down 3% amid rising customers complaints over build quality.",

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Unilever shares have ended as the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest riser in the FTSE 100, following news of their plans to boost shareholder value in the wake of the rejected bid from Kraft Heinz. The shares ended up 5.7% at \u00c2\u00a337/91, just shy of the record close of \u00c2\u00a337.97 on Friday when the Kraft bid emerged. Inflationary pressures are building in the economy, and here are more signs of that. Ada, Vaughan reports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big six energy suppliers are under pressure to pass on more price hikes to consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 energy bills, the industry trade body has warned. Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have already announced price rises for millions of customers, blaming a mix of rising wholesale costs, installation of smart meters and government policies paid for through bills. British Gas has frozen prices until August, while SSE and E.ON have yet to declare their intentions. The chief executive of Energy UK, which represents most of the 40-plus energy suppliers, told MPs on Wednesday that the rises were justified. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is plain that we have seen increases in wholesale prices over the last 12 months or so, and we can see going out into the future there are continuing pressures there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lawrence Slade. He said month-ahead wholesale gas prices for March were 100% higher than last year, and electricity was up 69%. The full story is here: Meawhile British Gas owner Centrica is due to report results on Thursday, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick preview: Back with Unilever, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now up 5.5%, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100. The rise follows its announcement it is acting to boost shareholder value following the rejected bid from Kraft Heinz. Rob Davies writes: Unilever has upgraded profit margin expectations and announced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comprehensive review of options\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to improve value for shareholders in an apparent effort to shore itself up against a renewed bid from the US food group Kraft Heinz. The Anglo-Dutch company knocked back a \u00c2\u00a3115bn bid from Kraft on Friday, and 48 hours later its US rival withdrew its bid, with both sides saying talks had ended \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amicably\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kraft is now blocked from renewing its interest for six months under the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover code, while Unilever has expressed confidence in the support it has from long-term investors. But management, led by the chief executive, Paul Polman, is thought to have been surprised that Unilever could be seen as an acquisition target and released two statements outlining plans to ensure shareholders wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be tempted by further takeover bids. In a statement to the stock market, the company said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conducting a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The announcement is likely to revive suggestions that Unilever could look to sell its struggling standalone spreads business. The company could also examine ways to boost the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price by stepping up efforts to squeeze costs, a strategy that would make a renewed tilt by Kraft Heinz more expensive if successful. The full story is here: Some strong housing figures from the US will increase expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before too long. Existing home sales climbed by 3.3% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69m units, a ten year high and well above the 5.54m expected by economists. The December figure was revised up from 5.49m to 5.51m. Demand for housing is being supported by a strong employment market, with buyers undeterred by higher prices and mortgage rates. Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors which released the figures, said: Much of the country saw robust sales activity last month as strong hiring and improved consumer confidence at the end of last year appear to have sparked considerable interest in buying a home. Market challenges remain, but the housing market is off to a prosperous start as homebuyers staved off inventory levels that are far from adequate and deteriorating affordability conditions. After consistently hitting new peaks in recent days, US markets have slipped back as investors pause for breath. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.21% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened slightly lower. A dip in oil prices sent energy stocks lower, while there was some profit taking ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes. Alasdair Pal of Reuters is tweeting about the Unilever news: A second announcement from Unilever just hit the City -- saying it is on track to hit the higher end of its profitability guidance The company say: The management of Unilever now expects Core Operating Margin improvement for 2017 to be at the upper end of its 40-80 basis points guidance. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 3%, following its pledge to unlock more value.... Hello.... consumer good firm Unilever has just issued an intriguing statement to the City. It says: Unilever is conducting a comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders. The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further. What does this mean? Almost certainly, the Anglo-Dutch giant is planning to cut costs, and possibly selloff non-core divisions (maybe the spreads arm?), before Kraft Heinz can come back with a better takeover offer in six month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Even though Unilever managed to defy Kraft Heinz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first takeover approach last week, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management must be disconcerted by the whole affair. And although Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major shareholders remained loyal to CEO Paul Polman, some must be wondering if their investment should be sweated a little... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is drawing up proposals for how it could intervene when a foreign company tries to buy a UK firm. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timely move, with Unilever having just told Kraft Heinz where it can stick its \u00c2\u00a3114bn takeover offer. Business secretary Greg Clark made the pledge during a speech at the EEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference in London today, telling delegates that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be setting out some proposals in the weeks ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clark was also quizzed on Brexit, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shed much new light on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy: Business investment in the UK fell by 1.5% during 2016, a decline of \u00c2\u00a32.7bn, according to new ONS figures. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first annual decrease in business investment since 2009, after the financial crisis. The ONS says firms cut their investment in buildings, machinery, and information and communication technology. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady fears the knock-on impact on productivity, employment and wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very worrying to see that business investment is already falling with the challenges of Brexit ahead. If this trend continues, working people will pay the price through weaker wages and fewer jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite a modest boost to public investment last year, UK investment still lags behind the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading industrial nations. With private sector investment in retreat, the Chancellor must focus on closing the gap with our competitors in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. This would help protect jobs and wages, and it would give a much needed boost to business confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how business investment has been lacklustre recently. The momentum in the UK economy at the turn of the year continues to surprise to the upside, says Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada. But he expects growth to slow in the current quarter, to around +0.4%, because: ...higher inflation and Brexit uncertainty present on-going headwinds to consumer spending and business investment, which the erratic contribution from the external sector is unlikely to compensate for. Ben Chu of the Independent has created a handy graph, showing how business investment has tailed off: The weak pound helped to cushion Britain from the Brexit vote shock, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improved GDP revision for the final quarter of 2016 confirms that it was business as usual for the UK economy, despite the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s momentous vote to leave the EU. The lower pound appears to have acted as shock absorber and continues to aid industrial activity and exports. The UK is also in a fortunate position of capitalising on any pick up in global growth given that 70% of its market is international. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth was less impressive when you adjust for population changes. GDP rose by 0.5% on a per-head basis in the last quarter, and is now 1.8% above its pre-crisis peak in 2008. Overall, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is 8.6% larger than before the financial crisis struck - making it one of the better-performing G7 economies. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised GDP data were a mixed bag of good and bad news, but this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the big picture that the UK continued to grow steadily during the six months following the Brexit vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Estimated fourth quarter GDP growth was marked up slightly from 0.6% to 0.7% due primarily to stronger estimated growth in manufacturing. This was linked also to a combination of stronger export growth on the back of a more competitive pound and a gradually strengthening world economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending growth also remained solid in the fourth quarter as a whole, although the latest retail sales figures suggest that this has shown signs of tailing off in December and January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Less positively, estimated annual GDP growth in 2016 was revised down from 2% to 1.8%, pushing the UK slightly below Germany (1.9%) in the G7 growth league, though the difference is well within the margin of error on any such early GDP estimates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main reason for the downward revision seems to have been weaker North Sea oil and gas production during the first half of 2016; however, this is a sector-specific trend that does not really reflect the underlying strength of the UK economy. Excluding oil and gas output, estimated UK GDP growth might actually have been revised up in 2016. Reuters have also spotted that Britain has lost its crown as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fastest growing major economy: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that fears of an immediate recession if Britain voted to leave the EU were misplaced. But...the fall in business investment is a concern, says Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Far from slowing down after the vote to leave the EU, GDP growth actually picked up in the second half of the year. However, there were some signs that Brexit uncertainty is starting to have some impact on the corporate sector, with business investment down during the last three months, combined with slower growth in consumer spending. Britain appears to have lost its claim to be the fastest-growing major economy. Despite the strong expansion in Q4, growth for 2016 as a whole has been revised down to 1.8%, from 2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slower than Germany, which grew by 1.9% last year, but still ahead of the US which only managed 1.6% growth. Now, all those numbers could also be revised in the future. But right now, chancellor Philip Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to boast about the fastest growth in the G7 when he gives next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget speech. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, has warned that consumer spending has tailed off in recent months. Overall, the dominant services sector continued to grow steadily, due in part to continued growth in consumer spending, although retail showed some signs of weakness in the last couple of months of 2016, which has continued into January 2017. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics is concerned that Britons are spending beyond their means.... The City has given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report a rather muted reception. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, says that last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are rather ancient history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK GDP may have gained some momentum into the end of 2016 but recent news from UK seems to have shown that that momentum has been lost in the early weeks of 2017. Services growth is set to slow, buffeted by rising inflation and slowing real wage gains and a consumer that is not waving but drowning, business investment remains poor given uncertainty over the negotiations between the UK and the EU following the Brexit vote last summer and while trade was stronger on the quarter this is purely a function of the devaluation of the pound Several economists are concerned by the fall in UK business spending (or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) in the last quarter. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group explains why it might be a problem: Jo Michell, economist lecturer at Bristol Business School, is also concerned by the 1% drop in business spending: Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pharmaceuticals sector had a good quarter: Overall, manufacturing output surged by 1.2% during the quarter. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy performed more strongly that first estimated at the end of 2016, aided by a particularly solid quarter for manufacturing growth. The resilience of the UK economy, particularly in the latter part of 2016 has been supported by a robust support from net trade and a rapid post-referendum recovery on consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence to keep spending. But... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy is rarely without its weak points and at the end of 2016 it was business investment. Capital expenditure by businesses saw a contraction in the final months of last year contributing the first year-on-year contraction in business investment since 2009. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too soon to declare this an worrying omen for 2017, especially as more recent survey indicators have been signalling a more positive trend. But..in a worrying signal, UK business investment fell by 1% in the last quarter. The ONS reports that there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a slowdown within business investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the last three months of 2016. This was driven by subdued growth within the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICT equipment and other machinery and equipment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets. As this chart shows, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has just posted its fastest quarterly growth in a year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that net trade helped to drive Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth in the last quarter 0f 2016. Net trade added 1.3 percentage points to the UK growth rate in October to December, says the ONS. That reverses a 1.2% decline in the third quarter. Breaking! Britain economy grew faster than expected in the final three months of 2016! GDP expanded by 0.7% in the October-December quarter, according to new estimates from the Office for National Statistics, up from 0.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because industrial output was stronger than expected -- growing by 0.3%, not flat as first thought. Construction output has been revised up to 0.2%, from 0.1%. The figures also show that the service sector drove the recovery, by expanding by 0.8% (in line with initial forecasts) But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news.... Q4 year-on-year growth has been revised down to 2.0%, from 2.2%. More to follow... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible, although unlikely, that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate for the last quarter could be revised higher in a few minutes, from 0.6% to 0.7%. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: The first estimate of Q4 GDP growth was 0.6% q/q in real terms. Since then we have learnt that favourable revisions to industrial production added 0.04ppts to headline GDP growth with marginally positive news in the construction sector too. This clearly means the prospect of an upward revision to GDP needs to be considered. However, as a central case our forecast is that Q4 GDP is confirmed at 0.6% q/q, as the preliminary estimate had an index level which translated into 0.56% to two decimal places. So, even with the known upward revisions it still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sufficient to turn into an upgrade to 0.7% q/q. Economist Shaun Richards agrees that an upgrade is possible: Newsflash: German business confidence has risen this month, according to the IFO thinktank. IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business confidence index index has unexpected come in at 111.0, beating forecasts, and ahead of 109.9 in January. The euro has now fallen its lowest level against a basket of currencies since last november, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. He says: Political risk is beginning to the Euro in earnest, reflected by the Euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade-weighted value reaching the lowest levels since the US Presidential election, and the OAT/Bund spread reaching the widest levels since then as well. Looking further back, we last had an OAT/Bund spread this wide in November 2012. OAT/Bund spread = the difference between France and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs. Kit also predicts further weakness as the French election approaches. Bloomberg have now been tracking the implied probability of the main candidates winning from Oddschecker for just over a month and Marine le Pen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s odds have risen steadily over that period while Emmanuel Macron and Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Fillon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have varied more. The net result is that all three are virtually level-pegging now. So much uncertainty with 9 weeks to go until the first round of the election means we will probably see nervousness persist, and undermine the Euro across the board. Housebuilder Barratt is also having a good morning, after it reported a 9% jump in profits for the last year. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is rising in early trading, led by Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds shares have gained almost 4% after it reported profits had more than doubled to \u00c2\u00a34.2bn over the last year. Lloyds told the City that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our performance is inextricably linked to the health of theUK economy which has been more resilient than the market expected post referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyds army of small shareholders will share a payout of over \u00c2\u00a32bn; the bank will pay a special 0.5p dividend per share, on top of a 2.55p ordinary dividend. Boom! The German DAX share index has hit 12,000 points for the first time since April 2015. Shares in German exporters are up, thanks to the weak euro (which makes them more competitive). Industrial giant Thyssenkrupp is leading the charge, up 4.6% after agreeing to sell its Brazilian steel business. Worries over the French election are also driving investors into the safety of German debt. This has pushed the interest rate on two-year bonds to a fresh record low of -0.87% this morning. That means investors are paying more than the face value of the bonds, so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make a loss if they hold them to maturity (although they can sell them to the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme instead) The pound has his a two-month high against the euro, as European political worries weigh on the single currency. Sterling has gained half a eurocent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.188 for the first time since 21 December, meaning one euro now only buys 84.17p. The euro is also losing ground against the US dollar; down 0.25% at $1.0507. The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness shows that mounting concern that Marine Le Pen could become the next president of France, and potentially trigger the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the single currency. Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes that as Le Pen victory could be curtains for the euro. No one seems optimistic about the political future. Marine Le Pen in France is now the front-runner to win the first round of the French Presidential election, and her prospects are also improving for the second round. This has caused the spread between French and German yields to surge, and we expect this to continue. Political risk also weighed on the EUR/USD, which managed to hold above key 1.0500 support but still looks vulnerable as victory for Eurosceptic Le Pen could spell the end for the single currency. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to get a more detailed look at how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in the last quarter. Updated GDP figures, due at 9.30am, will probably confirm that the economy expanded by a robust 0.6% in October to December - driven by the service sector. This second-estimate of GDP will also outline outline how government spending, household consumption, business investment and trade fared over the quarter - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather more comprehensive than the preliminary report issued a month ago. Overall, it will show whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is really taking the Brexit vote in its stride, or if consumers and businesses are starting to trim back. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The weakness of the pound is expected to help exports contribute 2%, while imports are expected to fall from 1.4% to 0.5%. Services are still expected to provide the majority of the expansion at 0.8%, though a little worryingly business investment is expected to stall. Also coming up today At 9am, the latest IFO survey of German confidence is released - showing how firms in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy feel about current conditions, and future prospects. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimate of eurozone inflation for February is published at 10am GMT. Economists predict at consumer prices rose by 1.8% annually, matching January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting financial results from Lloyds Banking Group, recruitment firm Hays, housebuilder Barratt Homes, outsourcing group Serco, and high-end confectioner Hotel Chocolat. The good news for Lloyds shareholders is that the bank has posted its biggest profits in a decade, as it finally puts the trauma of the financial crisis behind it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a special dividend in the offing too.... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, will release the minutes of its last meeting at 7pm GMT (2pm East Coast). They may contain hints on how close the Fed is to raising interest rates next month. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me first say that our economic agenda, the number one issue is growth and the first, most important thing that will impact growth is a tax plan. So we are committed to pass tax reform. It will be very significant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be focused on middle income tax cuts, simplification, and making the business tax competitive with the rest of the world, which has been a big problem and a lot of reasons why companies are leaving and cash is sitting offshore. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really our focus.</p> <p>We want to get this done by the August recess. we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working closely with the leadership in the house and the senate, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on a combined plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>On getting US economic growth back to 3%:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very achievable. If you look at long-term growth, we have underperformed where we need to be. We believe we can be competitive and get back to sustainable growth at 3% or more. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a lot of things that will impact it. I think the first issue, as I mentioned, is going to be tax reform. I think the other issue is going to be regulatory relief. we need to cut back regulations that have prevented small and medium-sized businesses from being the engine of growth in this country. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also focused, as you know, on Dodd-Frank and looking at Dodd-Frank and making sure banks can lend. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredible amount of liquidity out there. We want to make sure that banks put it to work.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quick: <em>If we stick to your time frame and we see something passed before the August recess, do you think -- we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen regulatory reform start. Do you think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see 3% plus GDP by next year?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take time to get there. So i think it would be, you know, more towards the end -- seeing the growth towards the end of next year. I think by the time we pass tax reform, you see the impact on the economy, you see the impact of regulation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely going to take into next year to see an engine of growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quick: <em>Obviously a lot of people are looking at this, the Fed and the CDO, and their growth projections are closer to 1.8%. What are they missing? They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any of this?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re missing anything.

                "bodyText":"Despite the positive German GDP data and a slight easing of concerns about the French presidential election, investors were in a more cautious mood all round. So most European markets slipped back, while US shares struggled for direction for a while before resuming their record breaking run. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 30.88 points or 0.42% at 7271.37 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.42% to 11,947.83 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.09% at 4891.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.35% to 18,819.49 But Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.17% at 9493.4 And in Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 649.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 54 points at 20,829 having earlier touched a new peak of 20,835. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece,. and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that new concessions the government has agreed to make in return for further bailout loans will not be without cost. The warning came as IMF chief Christine Lagarde also warned that Greece will have to reform before debt relief can be discussed. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Making his first public intervention since Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting, Euclid Tsakalotos said it was inevitable that pre-legislation of further pension and income tax measures would bring pain for some and gain for others. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some may lose out but some will gain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Greek parliament this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some who we do not assist at present \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we should help them - will gain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But he nsisted that the reforms would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiscally neutral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because they would have no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153net\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fiscal impact. Low-income taxpayers who looked set to suffer once the reforms were enforced as of January 2019 would get something else in return, he said. Tsakalotos had been roundly criticised for not addressing the public in the wake of the Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup where the government, under mounting pressure to resume stalled bailout negotiations, was perceived to have caved in to demands for further measures. Following talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christine Lagarde said it was now incumbent on Athens to implement the reforms if the IMF was to sign up to the programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously, the second leg is going to be the level of debt that the country can carry out and that debt will have to be restructured appropriately and the volume of restructuring will clearly depend how much reform, how much progress, how strong the Greek economy is at the end of the program,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What will be needed is not a haircut if the reforms are done but a significant extension of maturity, a significant interest rate capping and that will have to be discussed in greater details later on as progress is made on the reform front.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets appear to be pausing for breath, with all the major indices - including the Dow - in negative territory. The FTSE 100 was among the weaker markets, with a strong pound taking the shine off dollar earners and Barclays reversing earlier gains. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the pound having a strong afternoon - ....gains against the dollar joined by a 0.6% rise against the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the FTSE completely lost its way as the session wrapped up, tumbling around half a percent. The index wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by the reversal of Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earlier growth; the bank, which announced this morning that it had nearly trebled its annual profit year-on-year, shifted from a 3.5% rise to a 3% loss, investors displeased at the cautious tone and conduct charge-littered outlook outlined by the bank in its full year statement. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: It finally looks as if the downside is getting some traction across markets, with the FTSE 100 breaking lower and US markets posting small losses in the early part of the session. It is probably too early to announce the demise of the rally, but at some point something had to give, and in recent days it had become clear that the risk appetite that was so unstoppable a week ago had given way to nervous selling. US crude stocks rose by less than expected last week, helping to support the rise in oil prices. Brent is currently up 2% at $57.02 a barrel. Mnuchin also talked about issuing long-term - up to 100 year - bonds. Quick: There were some market speculation yesterday that you might today announce plans for a longer term Treasury bond, a 50-year and 100-year bond because of just that, interest rates being low right now. Have you given that serious thought, and is that something we should expect to see? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said this before. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the going to make a formal -- we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not ready to make any formal announcement on whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have a 50-year or 100-year. I have said this before. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that we should seriously look at. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already begun to talk to the staff about looking at that. Again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll reach out to the market, investors, different people, but I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that is a very serious issue of whether we should explore, whether we can raise 50 or 100-year money at a very slight premium. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that makes sense for Treasury to look at. Donald Trump of course said he would label China a currency manipulator, and Mnuchin is asked about this. Quick: Is it fair to say you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to be naming China a currency manipulator any time soon? Again, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say is, first of all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a terrific conversation with my counterparts there. I look forward to meeting them. We have a process within Treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go through that process. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do that as we have in the past. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not making any judgments until we continue that process. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the full quotes from Becky Quick CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview with the new US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. First, on the tax plan mentioned by Donald Trump ( the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax plan at that). He said: Let me first say that our economic agenda, the number one issue is growth and the first, most important thing that will impact growth is a tax plan. So we are committed to pass tax reform. It will be very significant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be focused on middle income tax cuts, simplification, and making the business tax competitive with the rest of the world, which has been a big problem and a lot of reasons why companies are leaving and cash is sitting offshore. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really our focus. We want to get this done by the August recess. we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working closely with the leadership in the house and the senate, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on a combined plan. On getting US economic growth back to 3%: I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very achievable. If you look at long-term growth, we have underperformed where we need to be. We believe we can be competitive and get back to sustainable growth at 3% or more. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a lot of things that will impact it. I think the first issue, as I mentioned, is going to be tax reform. I think the other issue is going to be regulatory relief. we need to cut back regulations that have prevented small and medium-sized businesses from being the engine of growth in this country. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also focused, as you know, on Dodd-Frank and looking at Dodd-Frank and making sure banks can lend. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredible amount of liquidity out there. We want to make sure that banks put it to work. Quick: If we stick to your time frame and we see something passed before the August recess, do you think -- we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen regulatory reform start. Do you think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see 3% plus GDP by next year? I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take time to get there. So i think it would be, you know, more towards the end -- seeing the growth towards the end of next year. I think by the time we pass tax reform, you see the impact on the economy, you see the impact of regulation, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely going to take into next year to see an engine of growth. Quick: Obviously a lot of people are looking at this, the Fed and the CDO, and their growth projections are closer to 1.8%. What are they missing? They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any of this? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re missing anything. I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making those projections based on the status quo. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the economy has been. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been actually lower than that under the Obama administration. And i think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at significant economic changes...We have a great economic team, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to put forth policies that are going to really create growth in this country. The full video is here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become a daily event, but US markets have opened at new peaks once more. A rally in oil prices and continuing hopes of a increased spending and cuts in taxes from the Trump administration are keeping investors in an optimistic mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 49 points to 20,824 while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.04%. Growth in emerging markets and a reasonable performance from developed countries will see the global economy expand this year, according to a report from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The agency says the outlook could however be affected by US policy shifts under the new administration, notably on trade and immigration. Overall Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says the average rate of growth in G20 countries is expected to rise from 2.6% in 2016 to 3% this year and in 2018. Emerging markets are expected to grow by 4.8% this year and advanced economies by 1.9%. The UK is the only G20 European country where Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects growth to slow significantly, from 1.8% in 2016 (as revealed this week) to around 1% in 2017, as the country negotiates its exit from the EU. As for the eurozone, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has lifted its growth forecast for Germany to 1.6% in 2017 and 2018, up from 1.5% and 1.4% respectively. The risk for Europe is that anti-establishment parties make meaningful gains in elections this year, it said. Madhavi Bokil, a Vice President and Senior Analyst at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big economic risk with such an outcome, is that it could lead to anyof these countries potentially leaving the euro area. That could result in a resurgence of the European crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The biggest risk to the global economy is that a protectionist shift in the US could damage global trade and the economic recovery. Back in the UK, and shares in Barclays have lost all their early gains and are now down more than 3%, making them one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100. The turnaround in sentiment comes as analysts re-assess the prospect of further fines for the bank, which has taken the shine off the news that it had tripled full year profits. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The bank has yet to settle with US authorities after rejecting an offer to settle a mis-selling claim for mortgage backed securities at the end of last year, which could provide a sting in the tail later this year. This is because Deutsche and Credit Suisse settled for $7.2bn and $5.3bn respectively, which might suggest that any potential future settlement is likely to be of a similarly high amount. Some early reaction to the US jobless claims. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight uptick in initial jobless claims isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too drastic, especially as many were suggesting the number of people out of work for the first time would be much higher. Overall, the US labor market remains pretty tight. Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too concerned by the slight rise, despite him placing jobs at the heart of his successful run for presidency. Anything around the 250,000 mark would suggest that the jobs market remains in good health. America is enjoying a two-year spell under the 300,000 mark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the longest since 1970 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the real test for Trump and the economy in general is delivering substantive wage growth and quickly. Just in: The number of American signing on for unemployment benefit has risen, but remains low historically. Some 244,000 people filed an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial claim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last week, up from 238,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3,000 more than expected. Even so, these jobless claims figures suggests the US labour marker remains firm. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the UK, Peter Ammon, is tweeting about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration are aiming to pass a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tax reform plan by the summer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Treasury Secretary, Stephen Mnuchin. Speaking on CNBC a few minute ago, Mnuchin said. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re primarily focused on a middle income tax cut, and simplification for business. He also promised that the administration will make sure that high-end earners don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a free ride. If they also benefit from tax cuts, this will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153offset with reduction of deductions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, refunds). Mnuchin also tried to play down the idea that the US might label China a currency manipulator, saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep his council until the Treasury has made an official assessment. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a terrific conversation with my counterparts there. I look forward to meeting them. https://twitter.com/nasoskook/status/834736369519976448 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a killer line from Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales figures, illustrating the problem facing the UK as the post-referendum recovery peters out. The squeeze on consumers looks set to deepen markedly over the coming months as inflation likely heads towards 3% and pay growth is limited. There are many in the retail industry who believe that intense competition among supermarkets and the big high street chains will keep prices lower than expected as firms take the hit to profits rather than pass on input price rises. But still, the higher costs of IT equipment, imported cars and domestic appliances will be hard to avoid. The impact could be to encourage substitution, which means consumers buying cheaper alternatives, or not buying at all and delaying purchases until prices have settled again. Or it could mean they simply fork out the extra cost and cut back spending elsewhere. Either way, it will slow overall activity in the economy and depress GDP growth. Economist Sam Tombs reckons Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers are right to be pessimistic about prospects for 2017. He writes: The failure of the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reported sales balance to recover significantly after its plunge in January provides more evidence that a consumer slowdown is under way. February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +9 reading is a clear margin below its +18 average in the previous four years when consumer spending boomed. The increase in sales volumes also was driven by the clothing sector, which perhaps benefited temporarily from unusually warm weather this month. Just in: British retail sales have picked up this month....but shop owners are increasingly worried about the future The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistributive trades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey found that 40% of retailers enjoyed a rise in sales volumes this month, compared to February 2016, while 31% saw them fall. That gives a balance of +9%, up from an 8% decline in January. But the deeper picture is less encouraging. The CBI also found that a majority of retailers expect the business situation to deteriorate over the next three months -- the worst reading in four years. Around 42% of retailers cited rising cost pressures as a factor driving the deterioration in the business situation, with 35% citing uncertainty over the Brexit/EU negotiations. This chart shows how rising costs are hitting most retailers: Ben Jones, CBI Principal Economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rebound in retail sales suggests that some of the recent gloom about a slump in consumer demand at the start of 2017 may be overdone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, retailers remain cautious about their prospects, expecting fairly tepid growth in sales volumes next month against a backdrop of rising inflation that is likely to erode households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power through the course of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the impact of the weaker pound feeds through supply chains, retailers are trying to absorb some of the increase in their import costs through savings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in Barclays have risen by over 3% this morning after the bank nearly tripled its profits last year. The bank has admitted, though, that it still has some problems -- including legal battles over its conduct before, during and after the financial crisis. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has been scrambling to repair its reputation since the 2012 Libor rate-fixing scandal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is fighting the US Department of Justice over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal and awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serious Fraud Office into the way it raised funds during the height of the banking crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Some City analysts are underwhelmed by the results too, as underlying profits in the UK fell. City AM has a round-up of reaction. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an eerie calm in the financial markets today (quite at odds with the gusts blasting between the City skyscrapers as Doris passes through). The FTSE 100 is up just 3 points, dragged down by budget airline easyJet (down 5% after going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning). Other European markets are also dull; even Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX only managed a 0.1% rise. As Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all rather muter.... The UK index lazed about under 7300 after the bell, once again failing to substantially break through that resistance level. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much excitement from the pound either, sterling sitting flat-ish at 1.245 against the dollar while flirting with 1.18 against the euro. After the mood-dampening, if superficially impressive, GDP reading yesterday the UK doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything to deal with this morning, explaining the rather snooze-worthy start to the session. A year ago, Stephen Hester, the former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland who now runs insurance company RSA, was one of 36 CEOs who signed a letter warning about the impact of Brexit on the business and the wider UK economy. So we reminded him about it today, as RSA reported its latest financial results. Hester says.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Brexit was the right economic course for the UK and we thought the UK would be poorer. I think the UK will be fine but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be as well off as it might otherwise have been.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turning to RSA, the owner of the More Than brand, Hester brushed off concerns. About 70% of profits are made outside the UK so they are boosted by the weaker pound once they are translated into sterling. He noted that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European subsidiaries are separately run and locally regulated, and RSA does not rely on passporting rights which allow banks to operate freely across the EU, while having most of their operations in the UK. RSA reported better than expected annual operating profits of \u00c2\u00a3655m, up 25%, due to a record underwriting profit of \u00c2\u00a3380m. Hester has spent the last three years selling off under-performing businesses, including in Latin America and Russia last year, and said RSA was now a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turned around company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd focused on becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best in class for our markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. RSA shares were the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100 in early trading, up more than 4% to 602p. Over in the markets, French government bonds are recovering as worries over the presidential election abate. A little. Traders are buying French debt after centrist politician Francois Bayrou threw his weight behind Emmanuel Macron yesterday, which could strengthen him in the battle against far-right leader Marine Le Pen. This means the gap between French and German borrowing costs has narrowed, having hit its widest level since 2012 earlier this week. However.... the latest polls show Le Pen extending her lead..... Not only is Germany outpacing its rivals, it is also racking up a record budget surplus. New figures show that Germany ran a net surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.7bn last year, which is the highest surplus achieved since reunification in 19990. This is only going to fuel the debate over Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on its neighbours, especially those eurozone countries struggling to bring their deficits down. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming departure from the European Union doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have caused Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy any grief. As in the UK, German consumers have taken geopolitical uncertainty in their stride. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that household final consumption expenditure increased by 1.5%, in 2016 as a whole, and by 0.3% in the last quarter of the year. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carolynn Look has a good take: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the fourth quarter suggests the economy is sturdy enough to cope with challenges that may arise from national elections, Brexit, and a more protectionist U.S. administration. Unemployment is at a record low and business confidence is rising, and the Bundesbank has cited a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very dynamic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd order intake as a factor driving future momentum. The economic situation in Germany in 2016 was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153characterised by solid and steady growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says statistics body DeStatis. Economist Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics believes Germany probably grew faster than estimated in the last quarter. He disputes the idea that imports surged much more than exports (3.1%, vs 1.8%) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Germany was the fastest growing major economy last year. Germany has wrestled the crown off Britain this morning, with new figures confirming that German GDP rose by 1.9% in 2016. That beats Britain, which only grew by 1.8% over the same period (as we learned yesterday), and means Westminster politicians won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to crow about beating the rest of the G7 last year. It also means Germany outpaced the US (which expanded by 1.6% last year, according to preliminary data). In the final three months of the year, Germany grew by 0.4% - recovering from a slowdown to just +0.1% in July-September. German government spending drove the economy, rising by 0.8% in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly the cost of housing and integrating refugees from have arrived in the country over the last couple of years. Household spending also boosted growth, rising by 0.3% in the last quarter. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carsten Brzeski fears that this means the growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sustainable... Net trade had a negative effect on growth in the last quarter, though - as imports rose by 3.1% while exports increased by 1.8%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking at Germany this morning, as updated growth figures for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy are released. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also have an eye on France, as its presidential election race unnerves the markets. British bank Barclays are publishing their results for the last financial year; pre-tax profits have trebled to \u00c2\u00a31.74bn. At 11am, the CBI publishes its latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistributive trades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey of retail sales in Britain. Eyes will be peeled for signs that UK consumers are cutting back, as inflation picks up. And later on, we get the weekly US jobless report (1.30pm GMT) and the latest oil inventory stats (4pm GMT).",

We are still years away from officially leaving the EU and a Scottish referendum on independence is unlikely to happen for the next two years. Thus, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reports may not materialise for some time, which is why we think that there impact will be fleeting.</p> <p> In contrast, the immediate risk to the pound could come from President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress on Tuesday. The dollar and the US bond market seem to have lost faith in Trumpenomics, 10-year US Treasury yields fell to their lowest level since November on Friday and the dollar index is 2% away from its December high. If Trump can put flesh on the bones of his pro-growth economic plans, then US bond yields could rise and drag the dollar with them, if he fails to do this then we could see further dollar weakness...</p> <p>So, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put too much stock on Brexit headlines and Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is a far more important risk even this week, and could determine whether we see further weakness back to $1.20 or if we get a recovery rally back towards $1.27... The real price movement is likely to happen late Tuesday/ early Wednesday, Trump will talk at 0200 GMT.

In manufacturing, new orders continued to improve significantly, while also the assessment of recent production has improved. The exports component also improved, indicating that the manufacturing sector is profiting from the recent weakening of the euro. In services, assessments of recent demand have surged, with expectations for future demand increasing as well. This shows that the first quarter could come in stronger than expected.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for the current economic strength is the tailwind from the labour market. Businesses are hiring at the fastest pace in years, which is also confirmed by this release of the economic sentiment index. In February, the pace of hiring increased further in manufacturing. In services, recent job growth was slightly weaker than in January, but employment expectations for the coming months increased.</p> <p>This shows that employers seem unfazed by the uncertainty coming from the packed political agenda in the Eurozone. Consumers may be less unnerved, their expectations for general economic conditions and future unemployment chances weakened in February.</p> <p>Consumers also indicated a jump in recent price growth. While this matches the headline inflation rate jump, their expectations of future price growth also increased in February. This is in line with selling price expectations increasing in manufacturing and remaining at a high level in services. The question becomes when these survey indicators are going to cause an increase in the core inflation rate, which has been stagnant so far. We expect that this starts to translate in slightly higher core inflation in the coming months, but nothing that will boost the core rate anywhere near 2% for now. The ECB will present their latest macroeconomic forecasts next month and it will be interesting to see whether the recent bout of strong indicators has impacted their core inflation forecasts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b3fc98e4b030b6f7c8f996\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-27T10:19:33.377Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eurozone confidence edged up in February, with positive views from industry and the service sector outweighing weakness among consumers and the retail area.</strong></p> <p>The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly sentiment index rose from 107.9 in January to 108.

                "bodyText":"Sterling has recovered from its worse levels but is still lower on the day, following renewed worries about the consequences of Brexit and talk of a second Scottish referendum. The pound is currently down 0.34% at $1.2424 against the dollar having fallen as low as $1.2385. Against the euro, it is 0.67% lower at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1713. Against a basket of currencies, sterling is also on the slide: On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress on Tuesday, US markets have opened lower after their recent record breaking runs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which closed at a record high for the 11th day in a row on Friday - is down 32 points or 0.16% with technology shares among the decliners. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.11% lower while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.19% as trading began. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The first set of durable goods figures from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency show a rebound after a disappointing December, but there is still plenty of work ahead for the White House administration. Trump has spoken at length about his plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending in the manufacturing industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but his camp is still very light on details. While demand in American production rocketed after his shock election win, doubts continue to build over how many of his promises he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll actually keep, which could see the often erratic durable goods market continue to wobble for the time being. More mixed signals from the US economy ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to Congress on Tuesday. New orders for US capital goods fell 0.4% in January, defying expectations of a 0.5% increase. However December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise of 0.7% was revised upwards to 1.1%. There were declines in January for electrical equipment, appliances and components, and increases for machinery and metal products. Analysts said the decline last month probably reflected businesses holding fire as they awaited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for tax reforms - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reforms at that - and increased infrastructure spending. But durable goods orders rose 1.8% compared to expectations of a 1.7% increase, although December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% fall was revised to a 0.8% decline. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders fell 0.2% in January. The pound may be weaker at the moment thanks to the latest Brexit anxieties and the prospect of a second Scottish referendum, but it is an event across the Atlantic which will prove key to the outlook for the UK currency, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: While Brexit headlines are dominating on an otherwise quiet Monday, we have no idea if Theresa May will actually block freedom of movement, or if she can do this from legal standpoint at this early stage of our Brexit negotiation. We are still years away from officially leaving the EU and a Scottish referendum on independence is unlikely to happen for the next two years. Thus, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reports may not materialise for some time, which is why we think that there impact will be fleeting. In contrast, the immediate risk to the pound could come from President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress on Tuesday. The dollar and the US bond market seem to have lost faith in Trumpenomics, 10-year US Treasury yields fell to their lowest level since November on Friday and the dollar index is 2% away from its December high. If Trump can put flesh on the bones of his pro-growth economic plans, then US bond yields could rise and drag the dollar with them, if he fails to do this then we could see further dollar weakness... So, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put too much stock on Brexit headlines and Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is a far more important risk even this week, and could determine whether we see further weakness back to $1.20 or if we get a recovery rally back towards $1.27... The real price movement is likely to happen late Tuesday/ early Wednesday, Trump will talk at 0200 GMT. Set your alarm clocks on Tuesday night and get ready for this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important event for sterling. Back with the European business sentiment survey, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at how confident various countries are: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the overall trend: Billionaire US investor Warren Buffett - recently involved in the unsuccessful move by Kraft Heinz on Unilever - has been speaking on CNBC after his annual report to shareholders was released at the weekend. He says his holding in Apple is now the second biggest stake in his Berkshire Hathaway company, and gave some views on the current state of the stock market. The changes to compensation payments continue to hit shares in the insurers, and are also likely to see premiums rise and the NHS facing extra costs of an estimated \u00c2\u00a31bn. Patrick Collinson and Julia Kollewe report: A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government-ordered change to the way personal injury awards are calculated will add as much as \u00c2\u00a375 to already fast-rising average car insurance premiums, and land the NHS with an annual \u00c2\u00a31bn bill, the insurance industry has warned. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has announced a change to the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ogden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discount rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is used to calculate compensation awards for serious personal injuries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to ensure inflation does not erode the future value of a payout. However, the unexpectedly deep cut in this rate, from 2.5% to -0.75%, has prompted a furious backlash, amid claims it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over-compensate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd victims of car crashes or medical incompetence in hospitals. The armed forces could also face far higher bills. Mohammad Khan, insurance expert at PwC said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a direct result of this change, we anticipate an increase of \u00c2\u00a350-\u00c2\u00a375 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially up to \u00c2\u00a31,000 for younger drivers (18-22-year-olds) and a rise of up to \u00c2\u00a3300 for older drivers (over 65 years old).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the cut was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless in the extreme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Huw Evans, its director general, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have repeatedly warned the government that this could lead to very significant price rises, with younger drivers in particular likely to find it much harder to get affordable insurance. It is also a massive own goal that lands the NHS with a likely \u00c2\u00a31bn hike in compensation bills when it needs it the least.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING economist Bert Colijn on the eurozone confidence figures: While consumer confidence declined somewhat in February as inflation rates have recently increased, businesses continue to see sentiment improve. In manufacturing, new orders continued to improve significantly, while also the assessment of recent production has improved. The exports component also improved, indicating that the manufacturing sector is profiting from the recent weakening of the euro. In services, assessments of recent demand have surged, with expectations for future demand increasing as well. This shows that the first quarter could come in stronger than expected. One of the main reasons for the current economic strength is the tailwind from the labour market. Businesses are hiring at the fastest pace in years, which is also confirmed by this release of the economic sentiment index. In February, the pace of hiring increased further in manufacturing. In services, recent job growth was slightly weaker than in January, but employment expectations for the coming months increased. This shows that employers seem unfazed by the uncertainty coming from the packed political agenda in the Eurozone. Consumers may be less unnerved, their expectations for general economic conditions and future unemployment chances weakened in February. Consumers also indicated a jump in recent price growth. While this matches the headline inflation rate jump, their expectations of future price growth also increased in February. This is in line with selling price expectations increasing in manufacturing and remaining at a high level in services. The question becomes when these survey indicators are going to cause an increase in the core inflation rate, which has been stagnant so far. We expect that this starts to translate in slightly higher core inflation in the coming months, but nothing that will boost the core rate anywhere near 2% for now. The ECB will present their latest macroeconomic forecasts next month and it will be interesting to see whether the recent bout of strong indicators has impacted their core inflation forecasts. Eurozone confidence edged up in February, with positive views from industry and the service sector outweighing weakness among consumers and the retail area. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly sentiment index rose from 107.9 in January to 108. A business confidence indicator rose from 0.76 points in January to 0.82, the highest level since June 2011. Back with the insurers, and PWC have crunched the numbers and calculated how much the new regime would push up premiums. Mohammad Khan, UK general insurance leader at PwC, said: The Lord Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement on the Ogden rate change to -0.75% was not anticipated by the insurance industry and is more than they were expecting. Unfortunately, this announcement will have a significant adverse impact on motor insurance prices that drivers pay and also commercial insurance rates paid by small businesses. As a direct result of this change, we anticipate an increase of \u00c2\u00a350-\u00c2\u00a375 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially up to \u00c2\u00a31,000 for younger drivers (18-22 year olds) and a rise of up to \u00c2\u00a3300 for older drivers (over 65 years old). This announcement, on top of the recent increases in insurance premium tax, will make redundant any savings to premiums as a result of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal injury legal reforms which were anticipated to generate approximately \u00c2\u00a340 saving per motor insurance policy... The announcement will also impact reinsurance pricing by pushing prices up for motor and liability reinsurance cover. This may impact the business models of companies that rely on low layers of reinsurance who will be faced with much higher costs of doing business after they renew their reinsurance. (Perhaps PWC should award the Lord Chancellor the Best Oscar for an unexpected announcement.... or perhaps not) The weakness in the pound may not last despite the Times report (\u00c2\u00a3) about a possible second Scottish referendum, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG: The report is highly speculative at the current juncture, and we doubt that it will have a lasting negative impact on the pound. Also, opinion polls have shown a modest increase in support for Scottish independence since the Brexit vote, but it remains far from clear that holding another referendum would have a different result. We still continue to expect the pound to strengthen in the coming months benefitting from rising political risk in Europe. ING also believes the eurozone lending figures will not lead to the ECB changing policy yet. Its senior eurozone economist Bert Colijn said: The current recovery in lending is no doubt related to the current loose monetary policy of the ECB. The cost of borrowing has come down to historical lows for both households and businesses, which in part drives the recovery of lending in the Eurozone. Still, with lending growth well below pre-crisis levels for the moment, it seems unlikely that the ECB will take as an argument to make changes to the QE program set out for 2017. Economic growth is picking up in the Eurozone for the moment and accelerating loan growth is underpinning that for the moment. This means that GDP growth may well have further upside in the coming months although political uncertainty continues to loom. Some positive lending figures from the eurozone: IHS Markit economist Archer adds: The ECB will likely point to the January lending data as providing ongoing evidence that its monetary policy is providing valuable support to Eurozone growth and should not be changed any time soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly as the Eurozone is yet to see a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation (it was stable at just 0.9% in January). Additionally, while the ECB is relatively upbeat on Eurozone growth prospects, it is very aware that there are appreciable uncertainties ahead, especially political ones (elections in Netherlands, France and Germany, the Brexit process starting and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency in the US)... The ECB has set out its asset buying programme until the end of the year, and we suspect it will not re-visit it until late on in 2017, very possibly waiting until the German election is out of the way in September. The pound is continuing to weaken, as worries about a second referendum in Scotland and concerns about the outcome of Brexit talks continue. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.2402 against the dollar and 0.59% lower against the euro. On the changes to compensation payments, the Association of British Insurers called the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and predicted it would lead to higher premiums and a \u00c2\u00a31bn hike in NHS costs. ABI director general Huw Evans said: Cutting the discount rate to -0.75% from 2.5% is a crazy decision by Liz Truss. Claims costs will soar, making it inevitable that there will be an increase in motor and liability premiums for millions of drivers and businesses across the UK. We estimate that up to 36 million individual and business motor insurance policies could be affected in order to over-compensate a few thousand claimants a year. To make such a significant change to the rate using a broken formula is reckless in the extreme, and shows an utter disregard for the impact this will have on consumers, businesses and the wider operation of the insurance market. We have repeatedly warned the Government that this could lead to very significant price rises, with younger drivers in particular likely to find it much harder to get affordable insurance. It is also a massive own goal that lands the NHS with a likely \u00c2\u00a31billion hike in compensation bills when it needs it the least. Over in Europe, markets have also opened brightly. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac are both up around 0.4%, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 up 0.1%. The banking sector was helped by a rally in Intesa Sanpaolo after the Italian bank said it had abandoned plans to take over insurer Generali. The gains came despite a 3% drop in Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse on new doubts about its planned merger with the London Stock Exchange. The dip in the pound is of course good for the FTSE 100, which is packed full of dollar earners who benefit from a weaker sterling. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Brexit fears are back on the agenda this Monday morning, with the pound bearing the brunt of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fretful trading. Sterling fell 0.5% against the dollar and 0.6% against the euro as the day got underway, following on from the losses seen last Friday. The reason behind the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning wobbles seems to be speculation surrounding a second Scottish independence referendum, alongside Amber Rudd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Sunday that Brexit will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcend freedom of movement as we know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide was good news, however, for the FTSE, which rose around 20 points after the bell, though that increase still leaves the UK index adrift of its persistent 7300 resistance level. The UK market has got off to a good start for the week, with the FTSE 100 up around 0.4%. Positive updates from Persimmon and Associated British Foods have helped, but the London Stock Exchange has dropped nearly 2% on doubts about its planned merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. But the biggest decline is in the insurance sector, after proposed changes in compensation payments which could hit company profits: Associated British Foods, which owns discount fashion retailer Primark as well as a sugar business, has issued a positive trading statement. It said it had seen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the first half, with strong growth at Primark and better performances in its other businesses. In a buy note, Liberum analysts said: Despite a tough retail environment, Primark sales rose 21% driven by 11% new space growth, flat like for like and favourable foreign exchange. Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EBIT margin remains pressured by adverse foreign exchange. Sugar profitability is strongly improving driven by cost savings, lower beet costs and improved pricing coupled with strong production in Africa. In [the full year] we expect a strong rebound in group profits as sugar profits recover and Primark continues a strong store roll-out program. ABF offers compelling exposure to secular growth trends in retail over the next 5-10 years. We estimate Primark can double sales and profits over the next 5 years. More on the changes to insurance payments, which has already forced Admiral to postpone its results. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters: Britain on Monday changed the rate at which compensation payments are calculated in personal injury claims, a move likely to increase the size of lump sum pay outs and potentially hit UK motor insurers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profits. The Ministry of Justice cut the discount rate used to calculate lump sum payouts to minus 0.75 percent from 2.5 percent, it said in a statement, a rate that had been in place since 2001. A downwards move in the discount rate is expected to force insurers to pay out more in cash to personal injury claimants now to ensure that returns over their lifetime met the awarded compensation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current legal framework makes clear that claimants must be treated as risk-averse investors, reflecting the fact that they may be financially dependent on this lump sum, often for long periods or the duration of their life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Ministry of Justice said. Admiral said on Monday it was postponing the publication of its annual results as a result of the change, to March 8 from March 1. The news is likely to see the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share prices come under pressure. Despite the dip in Asian markets, Europe is expected to open higher: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure again this morning following reports that Scotland would call for another independence referendum, and that UK prime minister Theresa May could play tough over residency rights for EU nationals, once Article 50 is triggered. Sterling is down 0.35% against the dollar at $1.2422 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2392. It is a similar amount down against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1754. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Speculations that Scotland could call for another independence vote hammered the mood in the pound market at the start of the week. The pound tanked to #1.2392 at the early hours of the Asian session, as the Times of London reported that Scotland could ask for a second vote of independency as PM Theresa May triggers the Article 50 in March. Although there is no need for additional panic at this point in time, the week started with Brexit related concerns and the current deterioration in the sentiment could dent the appetite in the pound and encourage more bears to join the sell-off at the start of the trading week. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, added: Theresa May likes to play hard without knowing how devastating the results could be for the UK. She wants to negotiate a good deal with her EU partners and yet she has upped the ante against freedom of movement. It is reported that any EU national who arrives in the UK before the date Brexit is triggered will not automatically get the right to reside permanently in the UK. Not only has she set the stage for nothing but a mess by fighting against those with whom she wants to negotiate with, but also there are reports that Scotland could call for a referendum next year. All this negative development, which has mostly been self-inflicted by Theresa May, is going to make the sterling the least desirable currency against a basket of currencies. Meanwhile Asian markets have edged lower, with investors cautious ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to Congress on Tuesday. Analysts are anticipating more details of his proposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phenomenal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd news on tax reforms, plus any other moves to boost the US economy. Ahead of all that, US durable goods figures are due later, with Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, saying: We are expected to get further evidence of the improvement in the US economy with January core durable goods orders which are expected to come in at 0.5%, unchanged from December. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be keeping an eye on shares in the London Stock Exchange, which said late on Sunday that its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse was in doubt after European regulators asked it to sell its majority stake in Italian trading business MTS. The full story is here: There is also a trading update from Primark owner Associated British Foods, and insurance shares could come under pressure after a change in the discount rate for calculating personal injury damages awards.",

                "bodyText":"A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government-ordered change to the way awards are calculated for car crash injuries or botched medical operations will add up to \u00c2\u00a375 car insurance premiums, and land the NHS with an additional annual \u00c2\u00a31bn bill, the insurance industry has warned. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has announced a change to the Ogden discount rate, which is used to calculate compensation awards for serious personal injuries, to ensure inflation does not erode the future value of a payout. Sarah Stanton, a partner at Moore Blatch law firm, said the change would make an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous difference to claimants with life-changing injuries, particularly given that interest rates have been low for several years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the unexpectedly deep cut in this rate, from 2.5% to -0.75%, has prompted a furious backlash amid claims that it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overcompensate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd victims of car crashes or medical incompetence in hospitals. The armed forces could also face far higher bills. Mohammad Khan, an insurance expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a direct result of this change, we anticipate an increase of \u00c2\u00a350-\u00c2\u00a375 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially up to \u00c2\u00a31,000 for younger drivers (18 to 22) and a rise of up to \u00c2\u00a3300 for older drivers (over 65).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Figures calculated for the Guardian by insurer LV= underscore the dramatic impact of how the rate change feeds through to huge increases in payouts. It said that if a 25-year-old sustained a moderate brain injury and was awarded \u00c2\u00a3100,000 a year for life, under the old system the total payout would be calculated as \u00c2\u00a33.1m. But under the new discount rate, the same person would be awarded \u00c2\u00a38m. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The old multiplier, based upon a 2.5% rate, was 31, giving a \u00c2\u00a33.1m [figure for] future losses. That multiplier is now going to be 80, resulting in \u00c2\u00a38m in damages,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said LV=. In the year to March 2016, the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) in England paid out \u00c2\u00a31.49bn in claims for clinical negligence, a rise of 27% on the year before. It declined to comment on how the change in the discount rate may affect future costs, but if the LV= example is used, it indicates that the NHS bill could soar towards \u00c2\u00a33bn. But Truss allayed fears that intensely-pressurised NHS budgets would be raided to fund higher compensation payouts, pledging that new money would be made available. There are concerns that much of the increased payouts will fall into the hands of no-win, no-fee lawyers pursuing the NHS. The NHSLA said that in 2015-16, of payouts of \u00c2\u00a3100,000 or less, where no-win, no-fee cases are common, 55% of all the compensation went to the hands of solicitors. The Association of British Insurers said the rate cut was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless in the extreme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have repeatedly warned the government that this could lead to very significant price rises, with younger drivers in particular likely to find it much harder to get affordable insurance. It is also a massive own goal that lands the NHS with a likely \u00c2\u00a31bn hike in compensation bills when it needs it the least,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Huw Evans, the ABI director general. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cutting the discount rate to -0.75% from 2.5% is a crazy decision by Liz Truss. Claims costs will soar, making it inevitable that there will be an increase in motor and liability premiums for millions of drivers and businesses across the UK. We estimate that up to 36m individual and business motor insurance policies could be affected in order to overcompensate a few thousand claimants a year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Small businesses could also be hit, PwC warned, as they face higher commercial insurance rates to protect themselves against liability claims, for example from members of the public falling over in a shop or a workplace.

The CBI said the decision subjected insurance companies to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large and sudden shock at a time when stability and predictability should be prioritised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson estimates the rate change will cost the insurance industry a one-off charge of \u00c2\u00a35.8bn to boost reserves, and a further \u00c2\u00a3850m per year increase in the cost of providing motor insurance. Insurers also said the rate cut would wipe out any benefit to drivers from recently announced reforms to whiplash claims, which were expected to cut between \u00c2\u00a340 and \u00c2\u00a350 from premiums.

That the only credible buyer of MTS would have been Paris-based Euronext added another twist to the game of competing national interests.</p> <p>An attempted land-grab by the French? Italian intransigence? Or was the German financial establishment, which has never been enamoured by the idea that a merged LSE/Deutsche would be housed under a UK holding company, stirring the pot? In the end, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. Even if the commission could be persuaded (and, technically, it still can be), other obstacles remained. The German state of Hesse could have objected. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/02/deutsche-borse-chief-probed-over-45m-share-deals-ahead-of-lse-merger-talks\">insider trading investigation</a> into a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5m (\u00c2\u00a33.8m) share purchase by Carsten Kengeter, the Deutsche chief executive who had been lined up to lead the merged business (and who denies the allegations), is an unresolved difficulty.</p> <p>What matters now is that the LSE prospers in independent form. A merger with Deutsche would have been messy and awkward. But a takeover from the US, in the form of Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, would be much worse. The LSE would be relegated to junior partner, a grim prospect if a post-Brexit goal for the UK is to retain the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as the financial capital of Europe.</p> <p>There are reasons to be cheerful. First, the LSE has emerged stronger from its many non-mergers over the last 15 years. Second, the jostling of national egos may have made Downing Street appreciate that ownership matters when it comes to stock exchanges, clearing houses and bond trading platforms. Theresa May is preparing to unveil the government stance on foreign takeovers involving \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical infrastructure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Liz Truss has merely followed the law in adjusting discount rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c used in calculating losses in personal injury cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to reflect the plunge in gilt yields since 2001.</p> <p>But, yes, there is something silly about a figure of -0.75% that could cause motor premiums to rise steeply and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/27/nhs-faces-new-1bn-annual-bill-after-reckless-change-to-injury-payouts\">create an annual \u00c2\u00a31bn bill for the NHS</a>. The system looks outdated. Common sense suggests even risk-averse individuals wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest all their lump sums in gilts, certainly not at prices distorted by quantitative easing.</p> <p>A more sensible approach would start by obliging insurers to underwrite long-term investment risk. Since they do so already in some cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c via a system called periodic payment orders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a compromise ought to be possible that still allows claimants to receive full and fair compensation.

That the only credible buyer of MTS would have been Paris-based Euronext added another twist to the game of competing national interests. An attempted land-grab by the French? Italian intransigence? Or was the German financial establishment, which has never been enamoured by the idea that a merged LSE/Deutsche would be housed under a UK holding company, stirring the pot? In the end, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. Even if the commission could be persuaded (and, technically, it still can be), other obstacles remained. The German state of Hesse could have objected. And the insider trading investigation into a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5m (\u00c2\u00a33.8m) share purchase by Carsten Kengeter, the Deutsche chief executive who had been lined up to lead the merged business (and who denies the allegations), is an unresolved difficulty. What matters now is that the LSE prospers in independent form. A merger with Deutsche would have been messy and awkward. But a takeover from the US, in the form of Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, would be much worse. The LSE would be relegated to junior partner, a grim prospect if a post-Brexit goal for the UK is to retain the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as the financial capital of Europe. There are reasons to be cheerful. First, the LSE has emerged stronger from its many non-mergers over the last 15 years. Second, the jostling of national egos may have made Downing Street appreciate that ownership matters when it comes to stock exchanges, clearing houses and bond trading platforms. Theresa May is preparing to unveil the government stance on foreign takeovers involving \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical infrastructure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She should make it crystal clear that bids for the LSE are not welcome, at least until the post-Brexit financial landscape can be mapped. Truss must find compromise on injury payouts The Association of British Insurers thinks the lord chancellor has made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decision. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair. Liz Truss has merely followed the law in adjusting discount rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c used in calculating losses in personal injury cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to reflect the plunge in gilt yields since 2001. But, yes, there is something silly about a figure of -0.75% that could cause motor premiums to rise steeply and create an annual \u00c2\u00a31bn bill for the NHS. The system looks outdated. Common sense suggests even risk-averse individuals wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest all their lump sums in gilts, certainly not at prices distorted by quantitative easing. A more sensible approach would start by obliging insurers to underwrite long-term investment risk. Since they do so already in some cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c via a system called periodic payment orders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a compromise ought to be possible that still allows claimants to receive full and fair compensation. Truss will review the current framework to ensure it remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which suggests she knows it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. PwC holds its hands up for Hollywood PriceWaterhouseCoopers was the auditor on the job at Tesco when the supermarket chain confessed to a \u00c2\u00a3263m overstatement of profits. The firm also conducted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-scope audit work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian operations that failed to spot the alleged fraud that ripped a \u00c2\u00a3530m hole in its last set of numbers. Now comes the real shocker: a cock-up at the Oscars involving La La Land. Only one of these disasters, note, shamed PwC into issuing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sincere apology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The power of Hollywood is remarkable. Or, rather, auditors tend to get a disgracefully easy ride when calamity strikes at large quoted companies. It is true that PwC lost its audit gig at Tesco (and would be wise to brace for a similar response at BT) but shareholders, unlike Hollywood producers and Oscar viewers, are rarely deemed worthy of a grovelling apology. The normal response is silence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or some empty words from Blah Blah Land.",
