Industry suppliers said fresh herbs such as coriander, parsley, mint and thyme were also affected by shortages. A spokesman for Global Fruit &amp; Veg, a Birmingham-based importer which suppliers local retailers, markets and wholesalers, said it had begun flying in herbs from Egypt and Jordan for the first time because it could not get sufficient supplies from Spain.

Supermarket shelves have been left empty and prices soared to as much as three times their usual price as supplies from Murcia, where more than 80% of many salad and vegetable crops sold in the UK usually come from over the winter, have slumped. Iceberg lettuce supplies to the UK have been particularly affected as it is extremely sensitive to temperature. More than90% of icebergs sold in the UK during the winter are grown in Spain. Growers began warning of shortages in December when the normally dry region was hit by flooding which washed away entire crops of some vegetables.

Shortages of courgettes, aubergines, salad and celery are expected to continue until April when UK production kicks in, and shoppers can expect to pay substantially higher prices for the stock that is available until then.
